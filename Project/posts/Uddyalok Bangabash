Sunday September 1st 2013 2:45 pm -04:00,I submitted my assignment about 4 days back i got a 41 back then. Right now i see that you can get a 42. What changes exactly do i need to make to get that score ? Of course i am not looking for the answer but the question. I dont get what They added a test case means., Resolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 9:04 am -04:00,You have to write the entire function. just like the other functions. All functions follow a similar template. BUT  and its a big BUTI suspect the auto-check program does not check for the part within the triple inverted commas it only checks for the answer (the part which follows the return statement gives the answer). Though its NOT good practice your function will still work if you skip that part which includes the examples etc. , Resolved,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 8:34 am -04:00,This does sound interesting.Anyone who checks your source code could reach your passwords. How do you plan to make the file executable and if you do how do you plan to provide a UI ?also if those problems are solved why dont you add codes so that it may generate passwords for you ?I have windows 7,None,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 1:35 pm -04:00,I Agree. I Know both C++ and Perl and frankly what I have done till know is just translating the keywords of one language to other not learn new concepts. I believe in order to practice more  you should go to the course wiki and practice all the questions give. Also download a Cheat sheet. Unless the issue isnt remembering the keywords but formulating the logic in which case making a flowchart / using a very simple language like QBASIC along with Python for doing the very same questions may help. QBASIC helps you get out of the structure of python and literally translates from English. For eg: variables are declared asLET A = 10and likewise. But QBASIC is an ancient language it should only be used to start feeling comfortable in the ways a programmer thinks and nothing more otherwise the structural format inculcates many bad habits. And as Rich says ask around. At the end of the day the point of the forum is to allow people with different degrees of knowledge to mix with each other and learn from each other :), Unresolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 1:41 pm -04:00,I suspect a lot of people here have issues not with python or even the visualizer but in keeping up with the ways a programmer should think breaking the job down into simpler things. I really suggest everyone take 10 minutes to go to YouTube and check out one flowchart making video. then maybe before starting to code scribble down a rough flowchart of the issue. That way you wont have to fight with the keywords and the logic of the question simultaneously. First figure out in brief English what the question demands then replace English with simpler Boolean statements and finally replace the rest of the English with keywords.At least this is how I started. , Unresolved,0
