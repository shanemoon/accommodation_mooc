Tuesday September 3rd 2013 1:47 am -04:00,In writing the codes for time_from_utc and time_to_utc I converted the utc_offset and the local time from hours to seconds and supposed to use the get_ ...   and to_float_hours functions to convert the seconds_difference to hours.  But thats not actually needed. By simply dividing the seconds_difference by 3600 I can get the same result. I submitted both versions and both got 42/41. BTW I didnt use the hours_difference function either., Unresolved,0
