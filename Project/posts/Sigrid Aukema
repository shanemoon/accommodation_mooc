Tuesday August 20th 2013 3:12 pm -04:00,yes! :) I hadnt recognised your last name sorry :)I watched the first three videos and am typing my notes now. No troubles so far just brushing up and expanding my English vocabulary: integer exponentiation precedence syntax error and semantic error....Am enjoying it so far. You too? I am happy with the subtitles though as I find the girl a bit hard to understand. I guess I have to get used to her accent :), Resolved,1
Sunday August 25th 2013 8:07 am -04:00,Junaid Thank you so much for your remark. I now understand what the ticks mean: I gave the right answer! I thought they meant that those answers were correct and should have been marked as correct. Thanks for clearing that misunderstanding!!,None,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 7:57 am -04:00,Hi MadhukarYou should have seen how your test was scored straight away but never mind. I will tell you how to find it.Go to the top of this screen. On the left hand side click on exercises. Then click on week 1 and it open and shows you week 1 exercise. Scroll down a bit and look at last attempted score. This is your score out of 15. Underneath you see Show previous attempts if you click on it you can see when you have done the test before and what your score was.If you click on the blue word review it shows you your test with your answers and the way it was graded. If there is a green tick it means you have given the right answer. If there is a red cross you gave the wrong answer.If it is not clear please ask again :),None,0

Monday September 9th 2013 5:41 am -04:00,Hi I am slowly getting frustrated here. Is it actually possible to do this course without buying the book?? I feel I miss certain information that every time makes me have to reread everything we have already done to try and find some bit of terminology to actually understand it. In this bit it is very simply the term return statement. I trip and do not understand why we get type errors because I do not grasp what exactly is a return statement. I must have missed it. that is the tricky bit with this course I guess. It is so logical that when you see it you can follow it. Then life gets in the way and you dont look at it for a week and when you continue where you left of nothing seems to make sense as the terminology doesnt seem to make sense and I feel like I have to start from the beginning to be able to understand it. It takes so long to get back in to it that I run out of time to finish what needs to be done before life gets in the way again grrr! Anyway is there any brave person who would like to attempt to explain return statement  to me or who can point me at the chapter it was explained in (not in the book as I havent got it). Very many thanks :), Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 4:10 pm -04:00,As I normally just use my computer to write emails and to read the newspaper I am running in to a problem. My computer (windows) does not have a program in which i can open the diary. I also have no idea which program would open the diary so I am stuck. I am running late with the assessment for week 2 and am panicking now as i can see the deadline but there might be a hard deadline (which might give me some extra time).... which I can not see. Anybody any helpful ideas or suggestions? Many thanks :), Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 6:14 pm -04:00,Thank you very much Aggelos. What a relief! As I only could see the first bit on the home page I was afraid that was the hard deadline. So happy I still have time to get it sorted! Thanks again! :), Resolved,0
