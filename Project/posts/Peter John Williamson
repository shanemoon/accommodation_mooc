Saturday September 14th 2013 8:05 am -04:00,HelloI have three items listed as errors from the auto marker - get_complementary_sequence_empty - ERRORhandout_example - ERROR and long - ERROR. The code works fine - empty () produces empty() - handout_example TA produces AT - long  ATCGATTGGGCCTGT produces TAGCTAACCCGGACA - false entries complement only valid nucleotides XFGGTTX produces CCAA. All seems good - so what have I missed? - is it the false entries bit?, Resolved,1
