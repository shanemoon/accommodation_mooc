Saturday August 24th 2013 1:08 pm -04:00,With the way that Coursera handles quiz questions the font size and layout of the quizzes is dependent on your browser (for example Firefox Safari etc) settings. If you have your font size set to a large font then the layout gets messy and overlaps. Unfortunately we arent able to do anything to prevent that from happening. If the quiz items overlaps try reducing your font size. , Resolved,0

At the point when the second assignment statement (<code>x = abs(x)</code>) is executed the value that <code>x</code> refers to is <code>10</code>. Therefore <code>y</code> refers to <code>10</code>. When the third assignment statement is executed the value that <code>x</code> refers to changes to <code>11</code> but <code>y</code> is not impacted by this change.It may help to trace this code in the Python Visualizer (see the Resources page)., Unresolved,0
