Sunday August 25th 2013 8:53 pm -04:00,I picked up the Practical Programming An introduction to Computer Science Using Python 2009 at my local library. Will this be sufficient? I see there are many other sources available online. But i prefer a book to reference. Or are there to many changes from original Python- Python3 to use this book? Any used ones? I looked on Amazon for Python 3 only new books., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 1:22 pm -04:00,Ok I have an older labtop. Im running Windows Vista Ultimate and very new to programming. But i do know alittle about computers. Ive listen to the lecture on Downloading Python 3.3. finished downloading and its working fine. But python is a document on my computer with no link to coursera I have to open a new window to work on assignments or exercises. Theres no interaction within . Is this how we work on programs? Do we cut and paste our work?, Resolved,0
