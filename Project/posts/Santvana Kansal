Sunday September 29th 2013 6:48 am -04:00,Hi!After writing my read-board function my output is:[[E F J A J C O W S S] [S D G K S R F D F F] [A S R J D U S K L K] [H E A N D N D J W A] [A N S D N C N E O P] [P M S N F H H E J E] [J E P Q L Y N X D L]]I think this is what is required - right? My game runs as well. However I get a failure notification when i submit my assignment (33/37) :(  Have spent more than 10 hours on this.  i have used 2 for loops and 2 lists in writing this function- cant explain much more without breaking the honour code. Can somebody help? Is the output meant to be different?, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 7:29 am -04:00,I even created another board.txt file with just single column entries to check if my pop method to remove  would give any problem but it still gave correct output and game works perfectly.  Cant figure out why my assignment is giving a failure notification.  is there a way for me to send my code for this function to one of the TAs without breaking the honour code? More than the marks i cant switch off my mind - i keep going through it to see what could be causing the failure in the assignment..., Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 7:48 am -04:00,I tried with the asymmetric board it pops the last character of the 2nd entry; [[A N T T] [X S O]]Thanks - will try & figure this out now!, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 10:42 am -04:00,Thanks @ anonymous! I had actually thought about that when using pop but it worked even when I had a 1 column board with no new line character so had not paid much attention. Dont understand why an asymmetric board makes a difference though. However the code was easy to fix by removing the pop method and putting in an if loop.Now another strange thing happened. I got read_board working but it gave me an error on the following (which i am sure wasnt there earlier. so i am still at 36/37! I think its something to do with my not understanding what NoneType means):student: test_a3.Test_10_UpdateScore.test_01_return_typeFAILURE, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 10:48 am -04:00,@Urko - i am sorry I dont know the subject so well so dont understand your errors.  Loading board should not be a problem as that is called through the a3.driver file. If you are testing it in the shell then you just specify the path in open function. Is your board file saved in the same directory as both a3 files? finally if you read line by line how would you get rows and columns mixed up.  Really sorry - you need some expert help here.  This is my first course:(, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 11:46 am -04:00,@ Urko - for the problem i faced in read_board function i had used a line.pop() to remove the  at the end of each line of board file.   So if there was no  in the line it removed the last character of the line.  hence instead I inserted an if loop saying - if character in line not equal to  then execute the for loop. remember - there is a main list and a nested list in this function so we need two for loops here.  hope that helps. There is some very good explanation by Tom Enios in another thread on writing this function. Though i tried a slightly different way..., Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 12:42 pm -04:00,@Urko - great!  thanks to you too!  i did not realize what Nonetype meant. So kept giving update_score a return function. finally 37/37:)).  Marking this resolved now, Resolved,0
