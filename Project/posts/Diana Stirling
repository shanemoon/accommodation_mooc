Thursday August 22nd 2013 11:21 pm -04:00,Im having the same problem in the same place. Im running (OK to laugh even harder) XP. IDLE looks the same on my screen as it does in James screenshot. But in the video were instructed to save our area function re-size our windows restart the shell and then run the triangle.py module. The problem is that the video shows the interface for a Mac & the interface is not the same on our PCs. We dont have the Run menu item; we have Debug in its place. Ive tried all kinds of things to try to make it work but to no avail. Suggestions? Have I missed a step? Thanks., Resolved,0

Thursday August 22nd 2013 11:29 pm -04:00,Update: I started over completely and it worked like a charm. (Used Run from the new window and it restarted in the shell.) Maybe this will work for you too James?, Resolved,0
