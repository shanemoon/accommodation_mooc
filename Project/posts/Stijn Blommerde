Sunday September 15th 2013 9:01 am -04:00,it would be great if you re-offer LTP2! I am really enjoying LTP1 and looking forward to part2.the advantage of us all starting at the same time is obvious:- the energy it provides- immediate responses to questions from peers- the right pace- etc.people if you agree vote it up!!!!thanks in advance stijn, Resolved,26
Wednesday August 21st 2013 3:44 am -04:00,Codingbat.com is a nice site for beginners to practice basics with lots of small problems varying from easy to hard. it does not look very fancy but it works well.

Monday August 19th 2013 4:41 am -04:00,hallo uit Amsterdam.mijn niveau: onlangs een andere coursera cursus afgerond. introduction to systematic programming design - part 1goede cursus veel geleerd aanrader! waarom deze cursus? python leren. extra oefening. andere cursussen starten pas over een paar weken.,None,1
Monday August 19th 2013 7:06 am -04:00,ik vind programmeren in het algemeen ook wel vrij droog net als het leren van een taal op de middelbare school. zeker in het begin als je met basale dingen bezig bent zoals de grammatica van de programmeertaal (syntax) en heel basale vergelijkingen (expressions).  Toch ben je al vrij snel in staat om wat interessantere dingen te doen. De laatste opgave van de cursus is het bouwen van een programmaatje om sudoku puzzels op te lossen.   ,None,0

Friday August 30th 2013 7:56 am -04:00,did you store a1.py in the same directory as a1_gui.py? the import statement inside a1_gui.py is looking for this file and cannot find it when it is stored elsewhere., Resolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 3:55 am -04:00,you are defining functions in the shell. this is possible but it is much easier to separate the function definitions from the function calls. define functions in the editor and call the functions in the shell.howto1. open editor: file - new window2. define one or more functions in the editor: def square_print(num): etc...3. save your function(s) in a file: file - save as - any_name.py4. run the module (file) in the shell: run module5. call the function in the shell: square_print(4)this procedure is shown in the video defining functions around 4:48. , Resolved,0

Tuesday September 17th 2013 8:23 am -04:00,objects are a special datatype which contain attributes and methods:1. object.attribute- retrieve attribute of object- i think the course did not cover the topic of attributes yet so i wont either.- object.method without the brackets does not exist2. object.method()- dot notation- call method on object- e.g. abc.find(a) returns 0 (because first occurence of a is at index 0)3. method(object)- some common methods have a different/shorter syntax - e.g. len(abc) returns 3- you maybe would expect abc.len(). this is wrong. - abc.__len__() does exist and also returns 3reference: type help(str) in IDLE , Unresolved,3
Wednesday September 18th 2013 4:19 am -04:00,i am a beginner and no authority on this matter but this is how i see it:theoryfunctional programming and object-oriented programming are two different perspectives to solve problems using code. The world of functional programming uses functions to construct programs and does not use classes objects or methods. The world of object-oriented programming uses classes objects and methods to construct programs and does not use functions. practiceIn Python we can use both perspectives and mix them up. method(object) is syntax from the object-oriented world which produces the same outcome as function(x) from the functional programming world. , Unresolved,0

Friday October 4th 2013 2:37 pm -04:00,a big thank you to Jen Paul the TAs Coursera and supporting fellow students (did i forget someone?) for the excellent course. I thought the course was a nice introduction to python and dealing with concepts applicable to any programming language at the same time came with good reference material and was self-contained at the same time was popular enough to attract a large supportive community answering questions in virtually no time and i can go on. In other words: I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn to program. see you all in Crafting Quality Code , Unresolved,0
