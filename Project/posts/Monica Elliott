Monday September 2nd 2013 10:30 pm -04:00,Hello!I saved a1.py from the first assignment as Assignment1.py. Every time I attempt to run or check the module a box pops up stating invalid syntax and the second 3 in Python 3.3.2 (v3. ... etc) becomes highlighted in red.Im not sure what is happening since I saved the file exactly as it was and I have been able to run other modules in the past. Restarting IDLE is not helping either.ThanksMonica, Unresolved,0
