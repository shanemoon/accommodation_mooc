Wednesday August 21st 2013 12:52 am -04:00,can anyone please help me to get a clear picture of round built-in function ?,None,0
Wednesday August 21st 2013 10:33 am -04:00,sir now i got to know what round built-in function performs. It takes two parameters a number followed by the value of the precision which is a decimal value. It can have atmost 2 arguments. The default value of the second argument is zero number of digits.I got confused with the first question in the exercise. I hope the concept that i happen to have in my mind is correct . thank you for your help sir.,None,0

Wednesday August 21st 2013 8:04 pm -04:00,for example when you typedef area(baseheight):     [hit enter] you will not get the prompt <<< ... then type the return statement in the next line     return base*height/2    [hit enter twice] you will see the prompt. area(34) [hit enter], Resolved,0

Wednesday August 21st 2013 11:14 am -04:00,Hi... I defined the function for computing the area of the triangle.clicked on shell and then restart shell.I called the function by passing arguments. I got the name error as in the video.clicked on file and then selected new window.I copied and pasted the function that i had definedlater i saved the file as triangle.py.Next step is to go to run and then select run module. But the problem is i am unable to locate run in the tool bar. :(, Resolved,0

Thursday August 22nd 2013 12:53 pm -04:00,try to run these commandsround(45)    round(45.6938521)round(45.6938522)In the first case the function takes in 45 as the value of the number which is the first argument. The second argument is zero by default.In the second and third case the function takes 45.693852 as the first argument as in the first but the second argument is specified explicitly. i.e the decimal values 1 and 2 are the precision values. the value of the second argument can be n number of digits the floating point number has to be rounded after the decimal point.this is the concept i have in mind regarding round built-in function., Resolved,2

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:21 am -04:00,hi Bontii consider the function definition>>> def add(number1number2):               return number1+number2here the variables that are enclosed within the parentheses are called as function parameters.now let us call the function addadd(52)the function returns the value 7 after evaluating the expression.the value 5 is passed as the argument to the parameter number1 and the value 2 is passed as the argument to the parameter number2. thus number1 refers to value 5 and number2 refers to value 2.argument represents a value you pass to a function when you call it..hope this helps you to understand the concept :) , Resolved,1
