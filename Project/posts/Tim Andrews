Monday September 2nd 2013 9:45 pm -04:00,Im stuck before I can even start the  assignment!  I cant download the a1.py file.  Clicking the a1.py icon on the assignment sheet gives me the code but I cant see how that file is downloadable to Idle (the address bar shows the file name beginning spark-public) .  If I right click the icon there is no function that lets me download the file anywhere.  If I open Idle the is no a1.py file that I can find using the file/open commands.  Somehow I making a basic error but I dont know what it is., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:59 pm -04:00,When I right-clicked there was no edit in Idle choice.  Ill try the saving in Notepad suggestion next., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 10:07 pm -04:00,Ive done all the lectures and submitted all the exercises with no problem so Im not sure why something as simple as getting a starter file is so difficult.  I downloaded Python from the website given to us by the instructors but maybe I did something wrong.  It seems like Im one of only a few with this problem. , Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:38 am -04:00,Im using Windows 7 but left clicking the link doesnt give me the option to download the file anywhere.  I used the cut and paste option but it was awkward and now Im having trouble submitting files for review.  I know I did step 2 of Assignment 1 properly because the testing worked fine but the submission results are showing no points.  For some reason my PC has a problem that others dont appear to have; Im not a computer whiz but I know enough to know that it shouldnt be this difficult.  The lectures quizzes and exercises have all worked fine; its only the first assignment that has caused problems.  Im only taking the class for fun and I dont care about a certificate so given how long Ive spent trying to fix these administrative issues Ill just skip the assignments.  Thanks for everyones suggestions. , Unresolved,0
