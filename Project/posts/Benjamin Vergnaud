Thursday October 3rd 2013 12:57 pm -04:00,HelloIm a bit lost about the about the feedback of Assignment 3.Ive completed all functions tested them all and everything has been working as expected.However functions read_words and read_board were considered wrong when I submitted them and I fail to understand why.Id appreciate any indication as to why they were rejected.Heres my code :def read_words(words_file):     (file open for reading) -> list of str    Return a list of all words (with newlines removed) from open file    words_file.    Precondition: Each line of the file contains a word in uppercase characters    from the standard English alphabet.        list_of_words =     words_file_open = open (words_file r)    for line in words_file_open:        list_of_words.append(line.strip())    return list_of_wordsdef read_board(board_file):     (file open for reading) -> list of list of str    Return a board read from open file board_file. The board file will contain    one row of the board per line. Newlines are not included in the board.        temp_board = read_words(board_file)    final_board =     for item in temp_board:        index_letter = 0        temp_list =         while index_letter in range(len(temp_board[0])):            temp_list.append(item[index_letter])            index_letter = index_letter + 1        final_board.append(temp_list)    return final_boardTest of my read_words function with the provided word list:>>> read_words(C:\\Python33\\Projects\\wordlist1.txt)[CRUNCHY COWS EAT GRASS]Test of my read_board function with the provided board:>>> read_board(C:\\Python33\\Projects\\board1.txt)[[E F J A J C O W S S] [S D G K S R F D F F] [A S R J D U S K L K] [H E A N D N D J W A] [A N S D N C N E O P] [P M S N F H H E J E] [J E P Q L Y N X D L]]Thanks !, Resolved,0
