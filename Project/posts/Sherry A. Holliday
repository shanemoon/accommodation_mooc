Tuesday September 17th 2013 9:17 am -04:00,May I continue with the course even if I am quite a bit behind? I seem to be slow at getting some ideas in Week 3 I may not be able to keep up time wise but I would love to complete the course just for my own knowledge. At this rate it may take me 8 or 9 weeks though.,None,2

Tuesday September 24th 2013 12:52 pm -04:00,My deep thanks to all of you! Unfortunately I dont seem to be grasping this in this format. I have gone over the lectures multiple times but Im just not getting the information to sink in. I will bail out for now. Im going to look for a book and see if I can go very slowly step by step and get this. I try to write the functions exactly as they show on the videos but I dont get my indents correct or something and I continually get syntax error or some other error message. Thank you again to the wonderful presenters tas and classmates.,None,1
