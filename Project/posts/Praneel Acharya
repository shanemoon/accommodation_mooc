Monday August 19th 2013 11:12 pm -04:00,They are not the usual underscores - It only worked when I  copying (__builtins__) and paste it from this board! but it doesnt work when I type. Please help me with it. You can also prove me the keyboard command and it will be a great help. LIke: shift+9 shift+- builtins shift+- shift+0But I got the solution just now. Hey I got the problem because of my focus on the solution. It clearly says we need to underscore. So the solution would be shift+9 shift+- shift +- builtins shift+- shift+- shift+0or dir (_ _builtins_ _) I left the space to make you clear that there are two underscore you just avoid the space I made to help those who are faing the same problem like I did.Thanks you all for the answer. , Resolved,1
