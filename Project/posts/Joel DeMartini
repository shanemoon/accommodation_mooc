Friday August 30th 2013 6:49 pm -04:00,I keep getting the following NameError in Python Shell indicating that I have not defined the function seconds_difference. I downloaded the a1.py file updated the seconds_difference function with a return command and keep running it in shell to no avail. See the error below:>>> seconds_difference(1800.0 3600.0)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#4> line 1 in <module>    seconds_difference(1800.0 3600.0)NameError: name seconds_difference is not definedAny help?, Unresolved,0
