Friday September 13th 2013 2:11 pm -04:00,I was just explaining stacks today to some of my engineering students who code in assembler and could not be called experienced programmers by anybodys standards (they are a nice group and do try very hard though).in assembler you mostly have to move values about between registers.  Lets say you added two numbers and the answer is in the AH register.  You want to output the answer to the screen but the graphics card also uses the AH register.  If you try to output anything you will end up overwriting the answer.So you push the answer in AH onto the stack to keep it safe.  You then use the AH register to do the display bit.  Then you pop the stack to bring back the answer and carry on from where you left off.You can have many items in the stack but they always go on top of each other and are removed again in a LIFO (last in first out) order.  You cant change the order of things once they are on a stack.  If you try to remove an item from an already empty stack you get an underflow.  If you havent allowed enough room for your stack at the start it can overflow (everything just dumps and crashes and you usually get the Blue Screen Of Death).  And experienced programmers do quite often use tools like the visualiser to step through code but they are usually called debugging tools.  They are not always separate from the main development interface sometimes its just a step-through option but its the same sort of thing.  It enables you to run your code a line at a time so you can see exactly where it falls over., Resolved,1

Saturday September 21st 2013 3:36 pm -04:00,You can still sit in on the course and not do any assignments.  Of course you dont get a certificate but you would be at a distict advantage when the course comes round again.  If you pass you get a certificate that you can print out and show people.  Nobody needs to know that you sat it once already and didnt complete it.  I am working through the Introduction to Databases course just for the materials.  I dont need or want the certificate but if that course comes round again I might just do it anyway.,None,1
Saturday September 21st 2013 6:15 pm -04:00,Actually I believe its a damn good course considering its free and the staff simply dont have the time to constantly upgrade their lecture notes to the very latest version.  Its easy enough to work out and in fact learning to work things out for yourself is a key part of the course.  Theres no need to get hysterical and abusive about it., Unresolved,4

Sunday September 22nd 2013 6:56 am -04:00,I had that happen to me on a different Coursera course.  Whenever I hit submit it changed the answers to something I had not picked.  I watched my sdcore go from 3/5 on the first attempt to 0/5 by the last simply because it would not accept the answers I put.  I am sorry to say that they never did get it sorted out and as that course has finished now I dont suppose it ever will be :(, Unresolved,-1

Monday September 23rd 2013 2:27 pm -04:00,Its definitely a problem with Coursera rather than the University of Toronto because I had the exact same thing happen to me on a different course (and several other people reported it there too).  They never did manage to fix it :( although I did get a very nice email from one of the Coursera staff who did try hard to sort it so credit where its due.  It is a known problem.  And no its not professional or even particularly mature to sit behind an anonymous tag making sarcastic remarks., Unresolved,-1

Tuesday October 1st 2013 10:35 am -04:00,Its a good question - and I think it depends on the institution offering the course.  I have done several things with Coursera.  At the moment I am working through a course from Stanford that dates back to 2011 and is not offered anymore but the materials are still there and believe it or not the forum is still active and receives new posts every day!  But then I did another thing with the University of Lausanne and everything was whooshed a fortnight later good job I had saved it all :-0I think you might be okay with the University of Toronto as the materials for LTP2 are still all there it ran last March and there are no plans to re-run it again yet.  But they have not taken the materials away., Unresolved,1

Sunday September 29th 2013 7:39 am -04:00,Nope I must admit that I too have found the visualizer to be neither use nor ornament.  in fact the only reason I ever use it at all is to do homework questions where it specifically asks.  And even then its only to double check after tracing the code through by hand., Unresolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 9:51 pm -04:00,You need to check the columns it sounds like you are still checking the rows!All the rows are the same length so it doesnt really matter which row you use for length.  A a column would consist of row1[x] row2[x] row3[x] and so on where x is the column number you are interested in.Then you just make a loop that creates a string out of those letters and check that the word is in it., Resolved,-1

Saturday September 28th 2013 6:45 am -04:00,What exactly are you trying to do?  I take it if the length is < 3 the point is 0 if between 3 and 6 point = 1 and if between 7 and 10 point = 2.you could do it backwards....point = 2if length < 7 then point = 1if length < 3 then point = 0and then return the value of point., Resolved,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 2:31 am -04:00,Its a bummer guys and I do feel for you.  But they do have to draw a line somewhere.  There are 30000 of us on this course and if they change the rules for one person then the other 29999 might legitimately feel that they also have some sort of claim.  If its any consolation an exercise is only 5% of the course total so you should still be able to make 70% overall.  Sorry :(, Unresolved,2

Saturday October 5th 2013 9:12 am -04:00,Ive been looking at the exam as though if you havent got 70% already from the assignments and exercises the exam is your final chance to get your score up to 70.  When  you look at it like that it doesnt seem so off-putting.  I havent done the exam yet but the guidance from the staff is do the easiest questions first which implies that some of the questions at least must be easy.  Ergo if you only need a few points and some of the questions are easy nothing to worry about!  Of course if you already have 70 from the earlier submissions you dont even have to do the exam at all although I will probably do mine anyway just for the practice. , Resolved,0
