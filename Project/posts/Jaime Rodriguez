Wednesday September 4th 2013 6:22 pm -04:00,I learned Basic and Fortran in the 1970s but the closest thing to programming I have done since is play with html and PHP for web page content. I am liking Python a lot. I also like the steady progression of the class from the very simple to ever more complex. I am already getting a glimpse of how many layers can be included in Python content.,None,0
Monday September 16th 2013 1:47 pm -04:00,I am trying to write a loop over string for the get_complementary_sequence function that refers to my get_complement function but the new function is not looping. It only returns the complement of the first character in the sequence and then terminates.It seems like it ought to be a simple loop similar to the count_vowels function from the video lecture but my code is not looping through the rest of the sequence.What am I leaving out?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 2:12 pm -04:00,That is the problem it is not iterating and I do not understand why.   sequence =     for char in dna:        if char in ATCG:            sequence = sequence + get_complement(char)            return sequence , Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 24th 2013 3:47 pm -04:00,I get it. The answer is supposed to point to the 4 in the third item in list numbers. The instruction to write an expression that evaluates to 4 is different than to write an expression that points to the given 4.  Any old 4 is not correct. It needs to be the specific 4., Resolved,2
