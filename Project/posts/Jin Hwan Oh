Monday August 19th 2013 3:31 am -04:00,I guess as a last resort you could rent a KVM VPS with an Ubuntu 12.04/12.10 Desktop template and run everything through the VNC/console. That way you dont mess with anything on your company computer though youll have lag.DigitalOcean is pretty easy to use and really cheap I think youll do fine with the 512MB RAM one that costs $5/mo. or $0.007/hr. Theres a lot of alternative providers as well which you can look through at lowendbox.com., Resolved,0

You probably installed it already but just ran the wrong shortcut.Start -> All Programs -> Python 3.3 -> IDLE (Python GUI), Resolved,0
