Tuesday September 3rd 2013 7:39 am -04:00,Is someone able to slap a number on the adoption rate of Python3?A colleague of mine wants to know whether or not the time is (about to be) ripe to make the switch. It depends partly on the availability of 3rd party packages (e.g. mysql mongo etc.) so one could argue that if at least 95% is available that then the time to switch is ripe.Are there people reading this forum who can shed some light and/or are willing/able to put a number to this question?,None,1
