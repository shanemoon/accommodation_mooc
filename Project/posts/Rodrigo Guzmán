Monday September 30th 2013 10:30 am -04:00,I was having problems with my read_board function after many hours of not knowing what the issue was I checked on the forum and found almost by chance:https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2724This is unbelievable! I also had the same problem and couldnt understand why the auto grader wasnt passing my board function. After changing my function with this new docstring I was able to get the full grade.It is not the first time an exercise or assignment has ambiguous or missleading information about how to proceed. One thing is to make it challenging which I am ok with but an entire different thing is to have wrongly worded misleading ambiguous exercises sometimes just plain wrong on how they are written. You dont know what you have to do and you are left wondering what the teacher wants you to do.I didnt post this as a reply to that thread because I am also addressing other instances in which similar problems happened.And before I get people telling me that I am complaining over something that I get for free and I am ungrateful etc. Yes I am complaining but if the course staff is mature enough to handle criticism they will understand that I am doing it for the best interest of everyone and as a suggestion on how to greatly improve the course. Which is what they ultimately really want as feedback.Cheers., Unresolved,1
