Monday August 19th 2013 2:15 pm -04:00,Also imagine that your program need some user input (eg. Type in your name:)...How much space do you need for that string? 10 characters? What if that is not enough?What if you actually cant predict ahead of time how much space would you need?Obvious answer is keep the value in heap let it grow/shrink to accommodate size (whatever it might be) and just use a reference to that memory location. , Approved Resolved,7
Monday August 19th 2013 2:30 pm -04:00,In C-like languages programmer have to explicitly specify exactly how much space you need to store values (both in stack and heap) and make sure that you explicitly free space after it is not longer needed (heap space). And be extra careful not to stump over other values that might still be in use.Im lazy and I really like that python interpreter will do this hideous task for me. :)(I know... There is a penalty in execution speed... I dont care... :D), Approved Resolved,2
Monday August 19th 2013 6:25 pm -04:00,I was under impression that in Pythonesque way types should not matter nor should it be stated in variable names it should just work in its intended context. Im thinking in the sense that no matter what type I have (it may be a custom one)if it has eg. a notion of items it should provide corresponding iterator methods and eg. for x in y construct will just work.Like:>>> text = abcdfg>>> fruits = {apple orange raspberry}>>> some_primes = [2 3 5 7]>>> len(text)6>>> len(fruits)3>>> len(some_primes)4It does not care what type it was given - it just counts them.Note that I could be totally wrong on this topic., Approved Resolved,1
