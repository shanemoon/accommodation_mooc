Tuesday September 10th 2013 12:38 pm -04:00,i am having the same problem - can it be spaces?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 9:53 am -04:00,My is_valid sequence gives an error after submission even though it works flawless.The get_complement and get_complementary_sequence both dont give me points - and they work flawless to - what is wrong with the submission?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 10:01 am -04:00,nope! return statements - and they work with every possible example..., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:20 am -04:00,My complement code is as follows:    dna1=        for char in dna:        if char is A:            dna1 = dna1 + T        if char is T:            dna1 = dna1 + A        if char is G:            dna1 = dna1 + C        if char is C:            dna1 = dna1 + G    return dna1why does it when being graded give me a fail? it always works with my examples?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:41 am -04:00,I dont really get it - i mean if you give my code the input A it returns T T it returns A etc. therefore the code should give me points in the grading - it doesnt..., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:52 am -04:00,it gives me a   in resonse... yeah i can see that but my code should give the same return as yours..., Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 11th 2013 12:20 pm -04:00,Maybe thats it - now i just have to wait 1 hour to check :Dcan you explain the difference in this situation?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 12:46 pm -04:00,So i can assure that the input is always a length of 1? cause if it is not my new code will return   this code:            if char == A:                return T            if char == T:                return A            if char == G:                return C            if char == C:                return Gmy other code:    if is_valid_sequence(dna) == False:        return     else:         for char in dna:            if char == A:                return T            if char == T:                return A            if char == G:                return C            if char == C:                return Gwill return the first nucleotide in the input - and therefore allows the entry of multi letter inputs - is this wrong?, Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 11th 2013 8:44 pm -04:00,I had the exact same code for both get complement and get complementary sequence - but the both failed - dont know why! thats why im writing here - they both work for both purposes but both fails... :D, Unresolved,0
