Thursday August 29th 2013 8:27 pm -04:00,Im sorry you were running into difficulty with the type contracts. It can be rather tricky to keep the various number types straight. Heres a quick summary:In a type contract if an argument (or the return value)...- will always be an integer we use <code>int which is a python type- will always be a number with a decimal point we use float which is a python type- can be an integer or a floating-pint number we use number which we use in this course to signify either the int or float python types, Resolved,3
Thursday August 29th 2013 8:16 pm -04:00,I agree that the wording should be improved in the future. The description attempts to address this by talking about the number of seconds as seen on a clock but I agree that it is not as clear as it could be., Unresolved,3

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 7:51 pm -04:00,Hopefully itll help if I take a moment to go through each answer and clarify what they mean:1. It doesnt mention the parameter types. Does the docstring mention the parameter types? Check this answer only if it doesnt and it should.2. It doesnt say what the function returns. Does the docstring say explicitly what value is returned? Check this answer only if it doesnt and it should.3. It doesnt explain which Python operators are used to perform the calculation. Does the docstring explain how the calculation was performed? Check this answer only if it doesnt and it should.4. It doesnt mention the parameters by name. Does the docstring explicitly mention the parameters by their names? Check this answer only if it doesnt and it should., Unresolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 3:30 pm -04:00,The questions asks for an expression that computes the ceiling not the answer youd get from evaluating that expression. For example for your problem it is looking for something of the form: some_function(some_value), Resolved,1

Wednesday September 4th 2013 1:35 pm -04:00,Hi Peter your question doesnt appear to be related to exercise 3 question 1. Could you please post it in a more relevant subforum?, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 2:10 pm -04:00,Id suggest starting a new thread in the Assignment 1 forum since it sounds like your question is related to that., Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 12:23 am -04:00,Writing descriptions that are short explicit and unambiguous is certainly difficult and we can always improve them. Hopefully the examples were sufficient to clarify any confusion. :), Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 12:10 am -04:00,Yes an expression is something that evaluates to a value. Something you could put on the right side of an assignment statement., Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 12:17 am -04:00,More formally addition is a commutative property meaning you can switch the order of the arguments and you still get the same thing. The twist is that + is not always addition in Python. Between two numbers it is but between two strings for instance it means concatenation (sticking them together). Concatenation is not commutative so A + B is not the same as B + A., Resolved,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 6:26 pm -04:00,I believe your code should work for any size puzzle and any number of words though if it got too too large it might take a while to run. :) The numbers of words youre talking about dont seem unreasonably large., Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 24th 2013 4:20 pm -04:00,Last time this course was offered lots of people were generating the right number by adding two of the other numbers... and we cant test for that with our answer checker. It created a headache for people so we wanted to clarify this time. :p, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 4:24 pm -04:00,stiron - by setting end= you are causing print to avoid adding extra blank lines. Print will then print just whatever is in the string (including any newlines you have in there)., Resolved,0
