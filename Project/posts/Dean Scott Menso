Saturday September 28th 2013 3:21 pm -04:00,Hi everyoneCan someone help me? I have made Assignment 3. When I tested my functions all of them worked except for read_words and read_board. After testing I submitted my work but it doesnt grade my work. I see 0.00/37. And Im sure that my functions arent incorrect because they work fine in IDLE except for the last two. Am I submitting my work incorrect or am I doing something else wrong?, Unresolved,0
