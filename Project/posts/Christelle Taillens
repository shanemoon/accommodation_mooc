Saturday September 7th 2013 7:09 am -04:00,I am not sure what that means still. My error says 9 != 105.Michael what do you mean by it should have returned the other one? So in my calculation it received 9 but it should have been 105? If so i still dont understand what is wrong. Any hint?, Resolved,0
