Friday August 30th 2013 1:01 pm -04:00,Using the link provided in the Resources I typed this problem into the Visualizer.  When I told it to Visualize Execution the code with the red arrow shows up at the top.  I cannot seem to get it to move anywhere else in the line of code - selecting either Forward or Last executes the first line of code and terminates the program.  Any ideas on what Im doing wrong?  Thanks in advance., Unresolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 2:02 pm -04:00,Snipping didnt seem to work for me (I found the tool fine) but was told try ctrl/shift/prt sc - can you see this?  Ill check it as soon as I post., Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 2:54 pm -04:00,Although I got the answer to the in-video question right I do not understand the explanation!  Can anyone please tell me what A stack frame for _main_ and a stack frame for g are on the call stack. means? I think it may be just an issue of my not understanding the terminology? Thanks in advance., Unresolved,6
Thursday September 5th 2013 5:22 pm -04:00,No Karl you are not!  I got successful answers to these questions by typing the code myself in IDLE (saved it because I thought it was pretty cool) and then copying it into the Visualizer.  It made a whole lot more sense to me that way., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 5:33 pm -04:00,Not realizing that greeting.py was a link I copied this code into IDLE saved it then copied it into the Visualizer and executed it stopping at the various points it was stopped in the screen shots.  I had two thoughts on how the frames were counted but watching the visualization step by step helped. Pauls answer about the thin grey line on the left is relevant., Resolved,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:28 am -04:00,I copied the sample program in video exactly (checked it multiple times).  Running the Debugger I was unable to get it to step twice to show the convert_to_seconds function in the Locals area.  However the functions called line in the upper area remained highlighted - when I clicked on that the convert_to_seconds showed up in Locals.  Past that I could do nothing though - and the line to be executed in the program doesnt move past def convert_to_seconds(num_hours): when it should be showing the line to be executed at this point to be minutes=convert_to_seconds(2).  I am using Python 3.2 - any thoughts?Thanks in advance., Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 9:24 am -04:00,Sorry this took so long Professor Gries; I had to ask a friend for help posting a screen shot.  I seem to have things working properly - the Debug Control screen shows the result after stepping through twice (which I couldnt get it to do the first time; go figure).  I believe that the last line of the program should be highlighted now though., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 8:24 am -04:00,I purchased the textbook but only have time during the week so far to do the course lectures exercises and assignments.  I would like to work through the textbook after the course is over to practice my learning.  Will the link to the practice question answers be available for awhile?Thanks in advance.,None,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 12:24 am -04:00,Im with you Anonymous - this Assignment may do me in which is sad having made it to week 4.  I am currently spending well over 15 hours a week on this and after spending about 8 hours today writing Step 3 codes having both of them finally test fine for multiple examples I submitted them for feedback and failed both.  I thought the first 4 functions for which the staff gave the starter codes were fairly straightforward given the material from the videos but now I am feeling a bit like a sinking ship.  Its not Monday yet though so Ill hammer away at it again in the morning., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 8:25 am -04:00,I think that certainly had something to do with it Etienne - I was getting an Assertion Error on my insert_sequence code - it had tested properly when I tested it but before I submitted it I managed to eliminate one very critical little s...also was getting a ReplacerModule error (I dont know what this is) on my is_valid_sequence code.  I shortened some of the docstring to include only examples shown by the autograder - dont know if that made any difference.  In any case the submission was fine this morning so on to the last two - thanks for the heads-up!, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 5:45 pm -04:00,The picky-ness of doing this stuff really frustrates me - I have needed (and thankfully received) a lot of coaching from a friend who is an ace programmer who grins and tells me Youre not the first person to yell Why cant you say what I mean? to a program. I am hoping the big lightbulb will go on if I keep slugging away at it. , Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 8:21 am -04:00,I think I am pretty close to the demographic for whom this course was designed - a flat beginner with absolutely no computer programming experience.  It would probably be a little easier for me if I hadnt dropped out of math as fast as I could (many years ago) in school because I have been really struggling with it too.  Yet I think the lectures are very well designed - I do listen to them multiple times pause them take notes on them and run their example codes while watching.   Unlike Anonymous my issues come in trying to figure out what to use to solve the problems at hand - Ive had a lot of help from the TAs and a computer programming friend who have pointed out errors and given me guided questions to help me figure out the correct path.  I would recommend this course to anyone like myself but with the caveat that they will need patience if they do not solve word problems easily - always my shortcoming in math/logic based courses!,None,1
Thursday September 19th 2013 8:51 am -04:00,Good info here; thanks folks - am posting so I can subscribe to the thread.  Anne you could have been me writing the original post - I am glad to know I am not alone!, Unresolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 2:17 pm -04:00,Im largely on the same page Anne - I was able to complete all but question 5 without assistance (except for some feedback on the first submission).  But all of those could be done simply by running the problems in IDLE.  Question 5 which required me to break down the problem to solve it I couldnt do on my own - my programmer friend who showed me what logic I was missing (that is how to do the problem) after I sent in my last submission told me I was halfway there.  But I doubt I can do future problems on my own; I seem to be deficient in this kind of problem-solving thought process.  Very frustrating., Unresolved,0

Friday October 4th 2013 5:13 pm -04:00,Let me join my voice here - I had a lot of trouble working through the course but I honestly think the material was extremely well-presented and the TAs helped me a lot.  I unfortunately seem to lack the mathematical aptitude necessary to connect point a to point b - but that is not the courses problem.  I stuck with it and learned a great deal - thank you thank you!,None,0
