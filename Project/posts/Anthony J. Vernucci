Wednesday August 21st 2013 12:53 am -04:00,Hi I am using Linux Mint 14 and Python3 does not come with IDLE. I checked the software and package managers and I could not find idle3. I also checked for python3-tools package but none is available. I looked at all the python package available and none has IDLE. Can I get IDLE from another version of Linux? Say Ubuntu? , Resolved,0

Wednesday August 21st 2013 3:41 pm -04:00,Etienne. I am having a problem viewing video lectures. My seetings are set to English but many of the Week 1 lectures play in a different language. Can you play the Week 1 Calculator lecture and see if it is English?,None,0
Wednesday August 21st 2013 2:59 pm -04:00,When I select this lecture it is in Spanish I think. When I select a different lecture like Introduction it is in English. I just want English lectures. My profile is set to English., Resolved,1
Wednesday August 21st 2013 3:04 pm -04:00,Week 1 Lectures Getting Started Introduction and Variables are shown to me in English. The rest of the week 1 lectures are I believe in Spanish. How Do I get the lectures only in English? My profile is set to English?,None,0
Wednesday August 21st 2013 4:42 pm -04:00,But that doesnt solve my problem. I dont have this problem with other courses I have taken.Please try to solve this problem.I should not have to do what you are suggesting and also I will not be able to do any on-line questions during lecture.Also I am deaf so really need correct subtitles in English.,None,0
Wednesday August 21st 2013 4:44 pm -04:00,ETIENNE open the Calculator lecture is voice and subtitles in English (if that is your language chosen in Settings). If it is in English why are the lectures I view not in English?,None,0
Wednesday August 21st 2013 6:55 pm -04:00,The cc icon was set to none. I changed it to English and it worked fine. I dont know why the cc icon is set to none. It is usually set to the value in my settings.Thanks.,None,0
Wednesday August 21st 2013 3:09 pm -04:00,Can the Lectures be given numbers? It is easier to say I have an issue with Lecture 1.4 than saying the Name of the lecture. Also the name doesnt have the week in it.,None,0
