Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:44 am -04:00,I am getting an error TypeError: float object is not callableThis is my 2nd attempt at this exercise and I think I got this right the first time. One of those days!, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:52 pm -04:00,I tried this a couple days ago and thought I understood it but then it didnt work and I had to give up trying for a day or so. Now I am struggling with how to organize my thinking. If str.find returns the first occurrence of the sub how will we ever find the 2nd with this call?? (if its a call; sorry I am new to this and not a math person so the language is still developing in my brain). By using math operators all we are doing is adding or subtracting the first occurrence with itself not moving on and continuing to count unique occurrences. Organizing the steps logically is the biggest challenge for me in this course. I know I can do it but I have to get used to doing it.Any advice is welcome.HM, Resolved,5
Thursday September 12th 2013 12:33 am -04:00,Hi Nick Yes in a way it does but to stay with the analogy this only works for this ONE item we are buying correct? I need to devise an expression that works for any item in the market to find the location of the second one on the shelf correct? I can customize the expression just for banana  or for apple but to make one expression for both items and find their 2nd locations is possible??Alison, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 12:45 am -04:00,Yes I am with you. I appreciate a language based answer instead of a more math/programming answer. I know what you are talking about. , Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 12:36 am -04:00,Hi TomThe question is requiring one expression to use with any string correct? So it doesnt matter where the first occurrence is located in a specific string? Its an expression that will be useful with any str/sub combination? Oh so I need to use a more general language for the answer and not so specific to any one str/sub combo (banana(ana)). ?? Alison, Resolved,1
Thursday September 12th 2013 1:19 am -04:00,Victory!! Woo hoo. I knew I knew what I needed but could not make all the punctuation work in my favor. Thank you so much Tom and Nick! , Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 1:22 am -04:00,Jennifer because you need to tell python to start looking for the sub in the NEXT index position. You find the first position then start looking again in the one next door. That + moves the search to begin again from the next index position.Alison, Resolved,2
Thursday September 12th 2013 2:09 am -04:00,Sandy for me it was a matter of getting the logic in the order it needed to be in and THEN the punctuation in the right sequence to do the logical steps. It was worth it to figure it out for me. Alison, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 3:05 am -04:00,Sandy You need to look for the 2nd occurrence of sandy BEGINNING at 7. Actually you need to tell python to begin looking in the space next to the  beginning index of the first sandy so no index location is left unsearched and the result is accurate. In Problem 9 the only result we get returned is the index location of where sandy number 2 begins. It does not return all the sandys in the example string. Use parenthesis to make expressions be defined in the order you need them to.So the first location plus (?) will tell python where to begin looking for the sub next? You dont have to know where it is located just the formula to create the next index in python language. Clear as mud?Alisonremember to use str.find 2 times and a math operator and punctuation (says the langage girl). For me there is an expression that is used as a parameter. Somehow that helped me understand it. When it worked it looked like that to me. If this doesnt make sense then just ignore that idea. I am sure its not critical to getting this correct but it made sense to me when i thought of it like that. My daytime here so no bedtime yet although it is time for the broken ankle daily nap. I am a captive audience for good or bad. , Resolved,2
Friday September 13th 2013 7:17 am -04:00,I am getting bogged down in reading threads and cant find the help I was hoping for.I have written a function that works in Idle. When I submit the assignment it is returned as failure with these messages: (sorry couldnt figure out how to write below the examples so they are at the bottom of this box)I have tested with an invalid capital and a zero-length sequence and both come back as predicted; false and true. Why is the grader grading me this way??I first made everything trueThen wrote an expression to return false if not the nucleotide with a final return of the function.It all works in Idle.Should I be more specific here? Trying not to write code here... but also trying not to write INCORRECT code! haha. AlisonMethod Description:Have you tested your function with an invalid capital letter?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorTrue is not false : Have you tested your function with an invalid capital letter?Method Description:Have you tested your function with a zero-length sequence?

Friday September 13th 2013 7:44 am -04:00,Ok so in Idle if I run my module and test is_valid_sequence() it comes back as True. But if I run your print test the answer is blank it doesnt even return any >>>. As far as the invalid cap letter failure again I do have a test for that and it comes back as False and I even did a few unscripted tests that also returned False. I dont know where I am going wrong to fix it. I will review the debugger video. I am not sure I followed it the first time. Thanks SO much for the help. I appreciate the effort people put in to help those of us less knowledgeable!Alison, Resolved,0

Friday September 13th 2013 8:11 am -04:00,True!Ok maybe I submitted the correct code too soon?? I submitted and it accepted but I got a failure so just now I tried again knowing it has been over an hour since I tried and I think I passed?? I cant even find it in the details of the summary and I am a dope and cant remember my former score! When I thought the code was spot-on I submitted and wondered if it had been an hour (i am not in Canadian time and cant remember our time difference) but since I didnt get a message saying it was too soon AND it was accepted I assumed all was well. When I checked the score the time stamp seemed to match my minutes (thats my check to see if I have my times correct). I was CLOSE to an hour but it might not have been quite an hour since my last try.If its not in the summaries I passed??, Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 8:15 am -04:00,Hi Marin It returned nothing not even >>> because the original print call was wrong. Annon  #1 fixed it and it came back True which was correct. It seems maybe I submitted too soon within an hour of my last submission. It was accepted and I didnt get a message saying it was too soon but it didnt really correct my new code submission. I am still trying to figure it out. The summaries dont make any sense to me. Or very little sense. Alison, Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 8:42 am -04:00,The body of the function begins by establishing the baseline that all is True.The I do a for loop to determine what is not True and have that return FalseI do a final return statement that returns the item used in establishing the baseline.That was it. , Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 8:24 am -04:00,ok so I did pass! How bizarre. I submitted before an hour from my last submission and it LOOKED like it was accepting and grading it and the time stamp changed but it must have returned the last submissions results and not even looked at the new submission. I did click all on the summaries and found my success. I wasted quite a bit of time wondering where there was a mistake when there was none!Assign 1 I submitted all the time with in an hour time frame and never had a problem. Assign 2 started giving me a message that it had not been an hour and had x number of minutes to wait to submit again. Now for this  problem on this thread I submitted (knowing it was close to an hour but not sure how close) and it was accepted but incorrect results returned. Yikes!Well I am glad I was successful none the less!Alison, Resolved,1
Friday September 20th 2013 6:21 am -04:00,I am confused by this question What is the sum of the odd numbers from 1523 through 10503 inclusive? Hint: write a whileloop to accumulate the sum and print it. Then copy and paste that sum. For maximum learning do it with a for loop as well using range.I thought range used indices so the answer will be the index location not necessarily the real number. And index location could contain a letter or a string etc...So dont we NEED to use something else to ADD numbers together to get a sum? I am really not understanding how to use the two loops for and while to get the sum of numbers in a range. ThanksAlison, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 12:55 am -04:00,Hi TomI actually did this all by myself and got it right! Minor miracle. Except I am getting one failure on the scoring matrix. It says test_a3.Test_09_WordScore.test_02_tiny_wordI tested with 1 letter words and its fine (2 letter also 3 etc....) but if I enter an empty string I get no answer (I suppose that is NoneType). I tried writing an if statement for  but it didnt work. Do I need to do that?? Why would  if len(word) < 3: not include an empty string? Maybe Ill try writing a line without len(word). Do I need to fix this? Will this break the rest of the code eventually?I am moving on not worrying about it except for a niggling worry.alison, Resolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 1:38 am -04:00,yup that was it. Woo hoo. Actually I stil have a failure for one of the checks on is_valid_word so my score is 24/37 but probably should be 25/37 at this point. , Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 2:00 am -04:00,ok so I cleaned it up and took out setting the baseline to False and just make the final return statement return False and all the tests still work right in the shell but my score didnt change. Its not been an hour so there could be an issue with that. So far every time I submit I am getting an updated score but I remember last assignment that was not the case. Although this assg. has been painful it has helped a lot in my thought process which is what I want to happen. I am on num_words and can see that it should be pretty simple. But I cant figure out how to accumulate the number of strings into an int. (with a bool as the beginning  board_contains_word). Baseline is 0board_contains_word confirms the word is on the board so I have a Truenow I use the baseline variable to accumulate the number of times it returns True. right?? but how to do this! haha. , Resolved,0
