Wednesday October 2nd 2013 2:01 pm -04:00,I also noticed the warnings on time thanks God! I almost opened the exam before noticing them. But I agree with some of the comments about such rigid time frame. I don´t have much free time I love this Coursera courses exactly because I can go at them at my own time and pace; during lunch break just before preparing dinner a couple of hours before sleeping etc. I just saw a TA´s post indicating not to post supposed errors in the exam´s questions since it could provoke anxiety to the students... sorry to say but this 1 attemp- 3 hour unstopable clock-no help from forums deal is what is causing anxiety! Attempting to finish the exam under 3 hours is really a sign that we learned better?... Anyway good luck to everybody I´ll attempt this Friday instead of going to the pub after work. , Resolved,0
