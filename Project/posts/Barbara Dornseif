Saturday August 31st 2013 4:57 pm -04:00,I am confused as to which version of time we should solve for.  Part of the description indicates in seconds - remember to solve for partial hour off-sets all the previous functions and the description and the second parameter is a time in that time zone  - yet the examples show what appears to be hours with decimal partials.I would normally create an if statement to allow for either but that seems to be clearly out of scope given the forum posts reaffirming the KISS principle.Barb, Unresolved,0
