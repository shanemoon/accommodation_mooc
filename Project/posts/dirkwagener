Sunday September 1st 2013 11:11 am -04:00,I have a rather odd question that has stuck in my head for a while. I dont quite get the advantages of Python over JavaScript. Can somebody help me out on this? I read about both languages on Wikipedia but I still dont quite get it. I am also aware that JavaScript is used often with webpages. For what circumstances is more useful to learn Python instead of JavaScript? Or is there no big difference after all?,None,0
