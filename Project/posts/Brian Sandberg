Anyway I installed 3 and there is no conflicts between the different versions. So far :) You will probably be happy installing 3. , Resolved,0

Friday September 6th 2013 12:43 pm -04:00,Thanks all. I am familiar with showing windows side by side and stacked. I just liked the split screen feature in tools like emacs. Unfortunately the current IDLE implementation doesnt yet support that. , Unresolved,0
