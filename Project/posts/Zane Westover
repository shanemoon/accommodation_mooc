Saturday September 28th 2013 11:22 pm -04:00,The question clearly states If grades refers to [60 70] select the statement(s) that will change the list to be [60 70 80 90]. Unless the new values are actually assigned back into the variable this requirement has NOT been met.This section actually assigns the return values into grades. This will change the list and therefore meets the requirements. The other three answers are incorrect since the list is not changed.There may be a way to do this but it has not been discussed in this course and doesnt seem to be very pythonic.grades = grades.append(80)grades = grades.append(90)grades.append([80 90])grades.append(80)grades.append(90)grades.extend(80 90)grades.extend([80 90]), Unresolved,0

I can run this function all night and always get [36] without any exceptions.Ahhhh... Python 2.7.5 has no problem with this but Python 3.3.2 raises an exception. My company is still on 2.7.5., Resolved,0
