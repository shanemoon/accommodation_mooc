Thursday August 22nd 2013 12:15 am -04:00,I had the same problem.  It turns out that even though I had downloaded python 3.3 the shortcut was pointing to v2.7.  I modified the shortcut to point to the 3.3 folder and I removed references to earlier versions from the environment variables. It all works now., Resolved,0
