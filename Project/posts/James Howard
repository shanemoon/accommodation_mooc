Monday September 9th 2013 7:17 pm -04:00,in the methods that require comparing individual characters in the string should I assume for the sake of this assignment all inputs are the same case?(uppercase vs lower case), Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:53 am -04:00,From the assignment specs: A string is not a valid DNA sequence if it contains lowercase letters.                So if its not an uppercase it shouldnt be considered as a proper value.That line didnt show up on the specs except for step 3 so it leaves other sections a bit ambiguous., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:44 am -04:00,I just went ahead and submitted it like yours and received full credit. Just bugs me a bit to write code that I can easily break with the wrong input. Can we talk about error checking soon? lol, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 11:06 am -04:00,For step 3 where it says A string is not a valid DNA sequence if it contains lowercase letters then yes we are fine for the most part but if for some reason that method is given an invalid input(i.e. user error) its better to have your code handle that error smoothly than having the program crash with an error. Steps 2 and 4 never specified that it should take uppercase only., Resolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 2:45 pm -04:00,EDIT: as soon as I posted it I saw my error., Resolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 3:29 pm -04:00,I tried. I can delete my initial post but the thread stayed. Unless Im missing something of course., Resolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 7:56 pm -04:00,So this is what the handout says:For A3 you will implement a word search game. The game involves an rectangular board of uppercase letters that is read from a file. For example here are the file contents representing a (tiny) 2 row by 4 column board:         ANTTXSOB            The game also involves a non-empty words list read from a file. For example here are example file contents for a words list:         ANTBOXSOBTOIm working my way through the assignment and I just wanted to verify the format of the wordlist1 and board1 text files and instead of having the text formatted like it is above it comes out as 1 long string with no new lines. Im using Windows Notepad. Curious how we are supposed to differentiate between words or rows/columns like this.Thanks , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 7:39 am -04:00,hmm so I thought I posted saying it worked anyway and I figured it was the use of Notepad when I resolved the thread. Oh well. Sorry to leave it a bit up in the air when I had it figured out., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 1:55 pm -04:00,What I ended up doing was running it with the supplied board and word list. After I had that working I expanded on both files adding more words so I could try to break my program if I put words in different spots on the board. Helped me find some errors that the supplied files didnt notice., Resolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 10:29 pm -04:00,My a3.py is working as it should but when I submit it the feedback gives me :Test results statistics - All=11; Errors=11; Failures=0; Successes=0; Warnings=0.

Tuesday September 24th 2013 7:36 am -04:00,seemed to solve most of my problems. I also put it in there to test and just forgot about it. Thanks for the help. now to chase down why Im still getting some errors -_-, Resolved,1
Tuesday September 24th 2013 2:38 pm -04:00,so your board that is being inputed into make_str_from_column(board column_index) fuction should be a list of a list of 1 letter strings (ex. [A B C] [D E F] and so on). you can use the column_index parameter to call a specific string inside each row list. All that you need to do is concatenate together a string from every row.Hope that helps., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 2:54 pm -04:00,try using a for loop like:for line in block:    #code to create string from column in block, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 3:09 pm -04:00,I pulled this from the python wiki page: collection = [hey 5 d]for x in collection:    print xwhat this would do is iterate through the list named collection using x as the iterator. so the first time through the loop print x would print hey. Second time through print x is the same as  print 5 and the third time print x is equivalent to print d back to the assignment.you have a board organized in a list of lists that each contain 1 letter strings represented like:[A B C]   board[0][D E F]   board[1][G H I]    board[2]you need a for loop that iterates each row. inside that for loop you can use the column_index to go to the specific column you need to make the string, Resolved,2
Tuesday September 24th 2013 7:23 pm -04:00,check what is stored in board.  I had mine working then I tried to clean my code up a bit and ended up making every row a string when I read the board file instead of how it should be where a row is a list of 1 letter strings. When I did I had the same errors you had but the program worked., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 10:35 am -04:00,if the problem is in your code another possibility is the column_index being passed to that function is incorrect by being 1 larger than it should be.EDIT: this would actually make sense  if you declared your column index wrong by saying it is the number of rows. If your code works fine for a square board but in a 4 column x 5 row board you are going 1 index too far in your column index (left to right across board). Im willing to bet that if you used a 4x6 board you would have to change the code from -1 to -2 to get it to work., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 12:27 pm -04:00,assume that all rows are the same length. That would ensure a  rectangular board. A square board like the one provided in wordlist1.txt is  a board where all rows are the same length but the total number of rows is the same as the length of a row. The input file is a single string with a  at the end of a row. All letters in the file are assumed to be upper case., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 12:54 pm -04:00,Is it? Im away from my computer right now (on my phone). Thought the provided board was 10x10., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 12:56 pm -04:00,And I thought the user inputed words while the game is running were not case sensitive but it was assumed the supplied board had all uppercase., Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 2:08 pm -04:00, Your error happens when you run the test:board_contains_word_in_column([[E NA] [X]] AX)This says that your board being passed into the program is:[E N A][X]This will cause an error if you try to manipulate any column after a rows index 0You can safely assume that every row is equal length. Like[X X X X][X X X X]       (Square)[X X X X][X X X X]  or[X X X X][X X X X]   (Wide Rectangle)[X X X X]or[X X X X][X X X X][X X X X]    (Tall Rectangle)[X X X X][X X X X][X X X X], Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 10:15 am -04:00,according to that your error happens when it tries to use the make_str_from_column function because in your code line 62:word = word + item[column_index]column_index is out of range. that means column_index is a larger value than the length of item.its possibly a problem with your loop in that function where its being told to index too far or it could be the function that gives that function column_index doesnt give you the correct value.what errors do you get when you submit online?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 11:24 am -04:00,with that error I would take a look at your read_board function. if you want to test it on your own make your own txt file with a board that isnt square like 4 rows of 5 letters and see what happens., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 12:22 pm -04:00,https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2558#post-14523 might be of help. the initial code isnt quite right but it should get you in the right direction, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 10:18 am -04:00,the a3driver.py file does the opening and closing for you. You should not need to open it in the code you write, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 10:04 am -04:00,I am not really sure what you are looking for. So you have is_valid_word working? If you do write the functions in the order they are shown in the a3.py. It is very helpful because sometimes you can use functions you have already written to help with other functions.Do you have specific questions?, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 10:48 am -04:00,how does it not work? does it just give the wrong answer or does it throw an error?, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 10:59 am -04:00,is your string you are concatenating the letters into empty to start with? did you initialize that string in a loop or outside?, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 11:07 am -04:00,try running it through the visualizer at http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html to see what is happening when you run it, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 3:21 pm -04:00,if you are still having trouble watch the for loop over str video from week 4 at about time 9:00. also check out the type list video at about time 3:50. its a combination of the 2 ideas., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 1:43 pm -04:00,describe your problem with update_score, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 1:45 pm -04:00,also have you written code for all the functions above update_score, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 1:53 pm -04:00,if you look at the provided comments for update_score the first thing i notice is that it returns NoneType so there will be no return statement. Now I look at player info and see that it is a list that looks like [players name score]. so that tells me i need to write code that will take a word find out how many points it is worth and then add it to the current players score., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 2:05 pm -04:00,ok so those tested your word_score function. did they work before?, Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 4:36 am -04:00,you dont need to use the variable score in this case. you can just use player_info[1]. This function does not return anything. Changes to player_info are visible outside the function. For more detail go watch this video at time 4:20.  Also look at for score in player_info[1]. What does that actually say? player_info is structured like [name score]. It is just a 2 element list. the for loop is trying to get the program to look at  every score in the 2nd item of the player_info list. there is only one score so no need for a for loop in this case., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 11:14 am -04:00,try using another list that you can append all the letters for 1 row into. then add that list to the board. hope that is not too vague, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 8:54 am -04:00,well its kind of hard to tell since you havent used separate lines with indentation but looking at it I would try list = s = GTHSFNFGfor i in range(len(s)):    list.append(s[i])print(list)After this code is run the contents of list are [G T H S F N F G]since this is in this thread Im assuming this in regards to the read_board function. this isnt the full answer for the code required for this function. you still need to tell the program to disregard the newline characters   at the end of every row and then add every row list to a list of rows., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 9:56 am -04:00,the range(len(string)):   call is wrong. and im pretty sure you need to chage the row in for row in board_file: to another name. you make a list called row just below that and im pretty sure that will error out. if you use line instead so you havefor line in board_file:after that think about what you need the range of for your second for loop. string is never defined in your code so you are iterating of the length of an vaule that was never defined, Resolved,1
Thursday September 26th 2013 4:37 pm -04:00,Do you write the code they do in the lectures as they do it? Its really helpful to do this. When it comes to programming by understanding the concepts of programming the coding becomes easier. If you know what you want to do you can use documentation and intuition to find the functions keywords operands etc you need to implement your idea. Ive coded in school before this class but it has been over 6 years so I signed up for this class just to get the fundamental concepts again so I know as I continue learning programming on my own I have a good base at the start.Dont be afraid to also use google or whatever search engine you like to find Python tutorials online. There is so much out there for free that are really good learning tools. I today printed out a python cheat sheet I found here. Maybe it will help some. Good Luck!, Unresolved,5
