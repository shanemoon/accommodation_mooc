Thursday October 3rd 2013 5:25 pm -04:00,This was such a great course Im recommending it to everybody I know who is interested in learning how to program. Im also going to pick up their book as both a thank you but also to see what other great examples they have. I really hope they have the second part of their course soon since they have made things so clear and opened up so many possibilities. Thanks to Jen Paul and all the others who made this possible!, Unresolved,0
