Wednesday September 11th 2013 5:24 am -04:00,Hello Harmony. First of all calm down. Im over 7 years experienced programmer and I had had a lot of problems like this.My first advice is (and you know it): read carefully. REALLY carefully. Then try to not get angry with it. Im here too because I dont understand it.Well the problem just like the other mate points out is RECURSION. He explained it well. Recursion is like asking oneself for the same task until is done. You dont need it know ok?Second advice and a little history of myself. When you really dont get it you paste and re-paste code and re-work ITS TIME to clean up just start again. Follow the Fuction Design Recipe and do it slow remember that you are a begginer.One day I was on a great deadline with an AVL tree(advanced topic) and I just dont get it. At 3 AM tired as hell I deleted all my code and start again. Slowly I maked it 2 hours late on the first try.Calm down and it would  go fine.Now the problem:You need the difference between time2 and time1 right? So what is that? What is the difference between something and something? its - right?What about time2 - time1? Try to return it.Then save you file(you are working on a1.py right?) and press F5 to run it.The IDLE shell is going to say Restart and then you can type seconds_difference(1800.0 3600.0).  Try it. I hope I help you and all who read me., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 5:39 am -04:00,They said its ctrl + p(as long Im not confused) but on my IDLE that means PRINT so how can I retype(or reuse) the last used fuction on shell on Windows( Im using Win 8 its makes any difference)?,None,0
