Tuesday September 3rd 2013 4:25 pm -04:00,Alt + P doesnt work for me but I found that you can actually select whichever key you like for that function.In your Python IDLE window click Options > Configure IDLE > Select the Keys tab > browse through the custom key bindings to find history-next and history-previous click on it then click the Get New Keys for Selection it will then prompt a new window for you to select whichever key convenient for you after that just save a custom key set Done!, Resolved,3
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 5:58 pm -04:00,yes i think there is an error in this question it only return True because there is no return when condition False is met so this None is returned instead as explained in the video lecture If Statement., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 6:47 pm -04:00,yes because in the or case we simple evaluate whether the statement is either True or False so it will give us one of them but if we put into the original question of the if case we have to meet a condition to return a value so if the first condition met then it will return True if not it will evaluate the second condition if that met it will return a true too and exit. In this case there is no condition which will provide a False., Resolved,2
Wednesday September 4th 2013 7:56 pm -04:00,I think in programming there is always a lot of way in writing the codes up to the programmers preferences but what accepted as correct in the quizzes is always the simplest answer which is what we shall all practice., Resolved,1
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:57 pm -04:00,Hi JoseJust a comment here I think the student who started this thread is having the same question in mind as me which we understand the difference between and and or but the question is asking which statement will give a True to the Boolean expression and not what Boolean expression needed to get the statement student at least passed one.For example if Case#1 math=60 bio=20 cs=30 the Boolean expression will be True. (one pass)But how about the following casesif Case#2 math=60 bio=70 cs=30 the Boolean expression will be True also. (two passed)if Case#3 math=60 bio=70 cs=80 the Boolean expression will be True also. (all passed)Besides isnt the statement passed some but not all can apply to Case#1 and also Case#2? Wont them be correct too?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:47 pm -04:00,Im asking based on the first question on Quiz 4 of Lecture 2 not the second question.As from what I understand the question is asking about which statement will give a True for the Boolean expression right?So in order for the Boolean expression evaluates to True which will means either one of the variables will be True or if two or all variables are True the Boolean expression will get a True too.So isnt this means it should be correct whenever the student pass either 1 2 or all subjects? Then shouldnt the answer accept both The student passed all of the courses. and also The student passed some but not all of the courses. too?Why the answer is only The student passed at least one of the courses. while not accepting the above two?Could anyone explain the logic behind? I mean what makes The student passed all of the courses. and The student passed some but not all of the courses. a wrong answer., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 4:09 pm -04:00,Quote your reply For the or which is what we are discussing the only false output is false+false+false.  Everything else equates to true. so shouldnt the answer accept everything except the statement Student passed none.?And Im getting more confuse with your example too if maths and cs are true but bio is false then isnt the Boolean expression math_grade >= 50 or bio_grade >= 50 or cs_grade >= 50 which will give a (True or False or True) then final evaluation will be True?We are not discussing the True or False of the statement but we are to determine which statement will cause a True to the Boolean expression in the question right?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 4:13 pm -04:00,so in this case I was wondering why the answer to this quiz question is only Student at least passed one while not accepting Student passed all and Student passed some as answers too., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 8:19 pm -04:00,I understand your explanation there is not necessary to have more than one true to get the TRUE in or Boolean expression.After reading the question again and again i think its the question itself that makes us confuse. It is stated Which English sentence is true exactly when the Boolean expression evaluates to TRUE so what is the meaning of this true exactly?If the question simply ask which minimum condition will get a TRUE result in the Boolean expression then definitely only one answer which is the at least one.If the question ask which sentence will get a TRUE result in the Boolean expression then all except passed none should be the answers. And this is the understanding Ive got. It just in my opinion whenever there is any true in the statements then the Boolean expression = TRUE so the answer should include all three cases at least one passed all and passed some., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 5:47 pm -04:00,your answer is correct too but wont it be easier just to compare two absolute value whether same or not (1 step) than to do the subtraction and compare with zero (2 steps)?, Unresolved,0

Monday September 9th 2013 9:04 pm -04:00,I have the same question as Sandeep too.However if the question asked for What is printed by the code above? isnt the answer should be as below (a list of numbers) instead of just a single number?0136101521283645, Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 4:42 pm -04:00,I tried to run the codes in IDLE for the Quiz 3 question and I did not get the None as stated in the example:>>> last_vowel(pfft)NoneInstead when I run this example I just get an empty.>>> last_vowel(pfft)>>>But if I change the last line of the code from return None to return print(None) then I can get the None as the answer.So I just wonder is this correct?, Unresolved,1
Monday September 23rd 2013 9:41 pm -04:00,Same here Ive compare the downloaded code with the one shown in video it just the same I tried to copy to run in Python Visualizer still Syntax Error.Wonder why...., Resolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 9:53 pm -04:00,Finally I found what is the error.There is a missing close parentheses on the second last line whereaverages.append(total / len(grades_list)   SHOULD BE    averages.append(total / len(grades_list))This error also happened in the example given., Resolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 11:00 pm -04:00,I guess maybe because when executing the return statement then only it discovered the syntax error.The error was not highlighted in the average.append line because the close parentheses could be on the next line which will be no error too for example:averages.append(total / len(grades_list))  <= if this close parentheses is missing and a return statement is written here then it will cause syntax error.., Resolved,0
