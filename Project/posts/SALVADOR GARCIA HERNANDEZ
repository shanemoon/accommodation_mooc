Monday September 16th 2013 3:05 am -04:00,Hello World... I have the same problem. the autograder still giving me two fails even when I just wrote return statements in all my modules... with all the examples is working even with other I already tried... any ideas?def get_complementary_sequence(sequence):     (str) -> str    Return the complementary sequence for the sequence given.    >>> get_complementary_sequence(CGTCA)    ACTGC    >>> get_complementary_sequence(TGCAG)    GACGT    >>> get_complementary_sequence(GTACGTGCATGC)    CGTACGTGCATG        complementary_sequence =     index = len(sequence)    pos = index    for index in sequence:        pos = pos - 1        complementary_sequence = complementary_sequence + (sequence[pos])    return complementary_sequenceIn the other hand for the module is_valid_sequence I include a couple of lines handling an empty string...def is_valid_sequence(dna):    if dna == :        print(Sequence lengh must be at least one nucleotide verify)        return False    valid_nucleotides = False    for char in dna:        if char == A or char == G or char == C or char == T:            valid_nucleotides = True        else:            valid_nucleotides = False            return valid_nucleotides    return valid_nucleotidesAny toughs?Thanks in advance..PD: My english is very poor... excuse me for that., Unresolved,0
