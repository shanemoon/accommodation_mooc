Saturday September 28th 2013 8:02 pm -04:00,I can trace what happens in Visualizer and it is correct however it just does not seem correct. I cannot see this working. Im thinking a list should have been created and then updated. I know what the instructions stated but the code below does not seem viable in the long run. By the way Jonathans score should be 3 since ANT is only three letters.def update(player wd):        player[1] = wd_sc(wd)update([Jonathan 4] ANT), Unresolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 9:25 am -04:00,Susan did you ever figure out the problem because I am having the same issue. My function is setup pretty much as yours and it works well in the shell & visualizer but not in the Autograder. In fact I end up with four AssertionErrors one of which is the BEEP error., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 11:04 am -04:00,Ashwini success with return. Thank you!Susan I just got it to work. By the way I am just getting to the Assignment so I haven not gotten as far as the Update Score function. Im working on make_str_from_row at the moment. Wish I could be more help to you. :-), Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 2:08 pm -04:00,SusanTry this:def valid_wd(wl wd):      good_word = False      for j in range(len(wl)):           if wl[I] == word:              good_word = True     return good_wordNow test it:valid_wd([ANT BOX SOB TO] TO), Unresolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 2:15 pm -04:00,I think I know the answer but I will plunge in anyway. Is there a Precondition that the each row & column be equal in size. In other wordsI caught an error (list index out of range) in Python shell & Visualizer when I tried out the following in my function: make_str_from_column([[G O O D] [B Y E]] 3), Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 2:36 pm -04:00,Thought as much just needed a 2nd opinion. Sepand I appreciate you taking the time to confirm. Thank you!!, Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 3:42 pm -04:00,Appreciate everyones feedback!Tom that is what I was looking for: a way to not have to know the lengths or size of the board and just allow the program to do the work which it appears your suggestion does just that. Thank you!, Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 4:22 pm -04:00,Cannot see why IDLE & Visualizer choke on the following:def column_word_on_board(bd wd):      for col_indx in bd:           if wd in col_string(bd col_indx):              return True      return FalseWhen I make the following call: board_contains_word_in_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]] TO)IDLE says there is a TypeError: list indices must be integers not list and Visualizer just returns False which is incorrect since TO is in column[3].Pointers are much appreciated., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 5:19 pm -04:00,Tom the bd[0] did it; however I am at a loss as to for the need to include the bds beginning index. I thought it was assumed that the program would begin at the first row unless told otherwise. Actually the program only ran into trouble when iterating beyond the second column., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 7:16 pm -04:00,Hmm...I am a bit/lot slow on the uptake so I could not follow when you stated not paying attention when I called len for board. I did call len on board both before Toms help -- range(len(board)) -- and after -- range(len(board[0])). Are you implying that I should not have called len on board -- range(board) instead of range(len(board))?, Unresolved,1
Saturday September 28th 2013 8:08 pm -04:00,It would help if you posted some pseudo code in other words not you exact code but enough to shed some light on what you are doing.By the way Ive been at it for almost 12 hours with a few breaks so I understand about a long day., Unresolved,1
Saturday September 28th 2013 8:27 pm -04:00,Heres an example:for col_ind in range(len(bd[0])):     if wd in <<call the column string function>>:        return Treturn F, Unresolved,1
Saturday September 28th 2013 10:03 pm -04:00,You are welcome. Just keep plugging away. That is what I am doing., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 1:21 am -04:00,Same here. I tried opening the wordlist1.txt file just before the read_words function but no good. Without being able to insert some sort of open or tkinter I am completely stumped. , Unresolved,0
