Monday August 19th 2013 5:05 am -04:00,I downloaded python 3 for windows 7 32-bit but i did not get IDLE. Instead python is running in DOS prompt. I am able to do all those arithmetic and variables stuff but I dont know how to save the function triangle.py to use the function and run the module when the shell restarts as taught in the last lecture of week 1. Please suggest a DOS prompt alternative method or tell me how to get IDLE. It was mentioned in the website that IDLE is included in the download, Resolved,0
