Wednesday September 18th 2013 11:46 pm -04:00,I have created the Type contract for this function and my 2 str arguments work fine but I cannot integrate the int argument into the Body.  I have named the int argument Index and am trying to use Index as a numerical value but get the error message that Index is not defined.  I know it is a simple fix but cant wrap my head around it.Chris, Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 12:26 am -04:00,How did you name loc?  I have it in the Type Contract but I get this messageTypeError: slice indices must be integers or None or have an __index__ method, Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 12:43 am -04:00,Resolved...the issue was in my test statements not my code.  I had 2 when I should have had 2., Unresolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 2:57 am -04:00,What does this message mean?  I get this return when I attempt to run my code for get_complement., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 1:43 pm -04:00,If I use return complementary_sequence in the body I will get G returned for CATGGIf I replace return with print (complementary_sequence) I get the result below:>>> get_complementary_sequence (CATGG)GGTGTAGTACGTACC>>> The last line is the correct output.  How do I get the last line in my print output to be the return output?, Resolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 2:10 pm -04:00,I think you have misunderstood.  I have written the code to get the iteration as outlined in the For Loop Over video and as discussed in forums it just I can only get desired output when I print output not when I return output, Resolved,0
