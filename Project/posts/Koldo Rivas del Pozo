Saturday August 31st 2013 8:21 am -04:00,I don´t understand problem with get_hours too...    return to_24_hour_clock(time_in_seconds/3600)>>> get_hours(90000)1>>> get_hours(93600)2>>> get_hours(5400)1>>> get_hours(7200)2>>> get_hours(82800)23But I have Assertion error on Assignment... thinking..., Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 8:45 am -04:00,But problem says:The parameter is a number of seconds since midnight. Return the number of hours that have elapsed since midnight as seen on a 24-hour clock. (You should call to_24_hour_clock to convert the number of full hours to a time on a 24 hour clock. This means that the return value should be in the range 0 to 23 inclusive.), Resolved,2
