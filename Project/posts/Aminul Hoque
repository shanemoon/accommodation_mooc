Thursday September 12th 2013 8:09 am -04:00,Hello everyone. Very excited to be doing this course and thoroughly enjoyed working with Python so far.Im guessing it wont happen judging from answers above but just wanted to inform staff that Ive been unable to submit assignment 1 before the deadline due to a faulty notebook and a nightmare returns process with the vendor!With my notebook out of operation I havent had access to a electronic data processing device (!) and subsequently python etc however Ive just replaced the notebook today and fully intend to submit the assignment as soon as possible.I hope we may be able to get some credit? Apologies for the late notification.Thank you.Kind regardsAmin, Unresolved,0
