Wednesday September 18th 2013 11:27 am -04:00,The question asks us to pick the code fragment that satisfies the statement: You want to make sure that Lola gets played at most 3 times  Doesnt the code below do just that?  It will never allow more than 3 occurrences it will only allow 2. So why is it considered an incorrect answer?while playlist.count(song) >= 3:        playlist.remove(song), Unresolved,2
Wednesday September 18th 2013 12:04 pm -04:00,Right it states at most three times.  Having a song in the playlist only twice satisfies the conditions.  It gave me pause to select that answer as correct but did anyway.  I think that I know the intent of the question but I chose to answer the question as asked not as it was intended to be asked. Logically 2 < 3 and therefore I thought the code snippet satisfied the question asked.  Ill chalk it up to the wording of the question and take the point deduction., Unresolved,1
