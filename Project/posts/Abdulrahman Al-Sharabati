Wednesday September 18th 2013 12:01 am -04:00,Hi I was a student of the last class back in late 2012 which I passed.  I saw a thread here about a student not being able to access the archives.  The answer was that it was locked to prevent cheating.  I unfortunately am trying to submit my work from that course for credit and I need more than a certificate of accomplishment and grade.  Things Id need are pages like the course logistics syllabus exercises assignments and the final exame.  I just plan on saving the webpages and sending them in.  If cheating is the concern would it be possible to open up the first course archive after this course is done?,None,0
