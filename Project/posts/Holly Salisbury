Monday September 16th 2013 5:09 am -04:00,HI Ive been able to make the .srt subtitles work in VLC player. As long as the subtitle file and the video file are in the same folder.  If they arent you need to open the subtitle file up using VLC... can do this by starting then pausing the video then the video pull down menu -> subtitle track -> open file. Hope you can get it figured out.  , Unresolved,2
Sunday September 15th 2013 11:48 pm -04:00,Ive put off doing this assignment till the last minute.. my bad... but I have managed to complete it in time.  But despite everything working great on my end the autograder apparently doesnt like me.  Submitted multiple times have triple checked examples spelling indents spaces ect.  Cant seem to attain the last three points.  Have errors/failure in these three areas-student: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_handout_examplestudent: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_longstudent: test_a2.TestGetComplement.test_get_complement>>> get_complement(T)A>>> get_complement(A)T>>> get_complement(G)C>>> get_complement(C)G>>> get_complementary_sequence(TA)AT>>> get_complementary_sequence(AT)TA>>> get_complementary_sequence(GC)CG>>> get_complementary_sequence(CG)GC>>> get_complementary_sequence(TAGC)ATCG>>> get_complementary_sequence(TACGCGATCGTAGC)ATGCGCTAGCATCG>>> get_complementary_sequence(T)A>>>get_complementary_sequence(GGCCTTAA)CCGGAATTNo use of print in my code.So... what now?, Resolved,1

Monday September 16th 2013 12:15 am -04:00,I have read the A2 FAQ.. been through it several times and again checked over my code.  Do I need to add code to deal with examples like...>>> get_complement()>>> get_complement(a)>>> get_complementary_sequence(JTA)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#111> line 1 in <module>    get_complementary_sequence(JTA)  File C:\Users\Holly\Downloads\a2.py line 160 in get_complementary_sequenceTypeError: Cant convert NoneType object to str implicitly>>> get_complementary_sequence(a)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#112> line 1 in <module>    get_complementary_sequence(a)  File C:\Users\Holly\Downloads\a2.py line 160 in get_complementary_sequenceTypeError: Cant convert NoneType object to str implicitly>>> get_complementary_sequence(), Resolved,0

Monday September 16th 2013 12:27 am -04:00,def get_complement(nucleotide):    (str) -> str    The first parameter is a nucleotide (A T C or G).    Return the nucleotides complement.   >>>get_complement(T)   A   >>>get_complement(A)   T   >>>get_complement(G)   C   >>>get_complement(C)   G      [Code removed]def get_complementary_sequence(dna):    (str) -> str    The parameter is a DNA sequence. Return the DNA sequence that    is complementary to the given DNA sequence.    For exmaple if you call this function with AT as the argument    it should return TA.    >>>get_complementary_sequence(TA)    AT    >>>get_complementary_sequence(CG)    GC    >>>get_complementary_sequence(AT)    TA    >>>get_complementary_sequence(GC)    CG        [Code removed], Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 1:04 am -04:00,Yay! That fixed the problem!  Thank you so much Etienne! It is extremely frustrating when I can see the code working for me but not having it work for the machine.  I think I used is because I have tinkered with code in the past and I knew it would work.. just didnt stop to think it might cause problems with the autograder.  Guess itd be wise to remember to stick with using what has been taught not what hasnt.  Thanks again!, Resolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 5:22 pm -04:00,Is there a minimum or maximum puzzle size and/ or word count we should stick too?  Would a 20 x 20 or a 30 x 30 puzzle with about 30-40 words be to much? , Unresolved,0
