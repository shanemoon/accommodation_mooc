Tuesday September 17th 2013 11:08 pm -04:00,So I thought Id post this on the off chance that its helpful to someone else whos just starting out with this course using Linux Mint (or similar Linux Build). With the newest Linux Mint version Olivia 15 KDE IDLE is an independent install through the Software Manager. However the version you get through the Software Manager runs on the default version of Python which at the moment is 2.7.4. So youd be running a 2.x shell instead of a 3.x.So the simplest solution here is opening the Konsole (terminal) and typing the following (dont bother typing the bold stuff. Its just what Konsole shows):USER@COMPUTER:~ > sudo apt-get install idle3Hit enter and it will ask you for the admin password for the system and then another enter will run it. Konsole will pull down the necessary information and then ask you to approve installation of any dependencies (other programs IDLE 3 needs). Youll get a [Y/n]? statement. Enter Y and enter again. It will finish installing on its own after that point and will eventually show the USER@COMPUTER:~ > line again. Youll be able to find the program under Applications > Development > IDLE 3 in the main menu.As a side note these steps might be different for people on different versions of Linux. I havent used many of them personally. Just Mint. If it doesnt work for you Id look up to see what install command your Linux build will accept.Anyway. Just thought that might help one or two people. Good luck. :D,None,0
