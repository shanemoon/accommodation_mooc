Sunday September 8th 2013 5:44 am -04:00,Hi Can someone help me please. I am completely confused with the quiz. I honestly dont understand the question hence I cant answer it. What is the question asking? Below is the question; The function count_vowels returns the number of vowels in a given word (a str). For example:>>> count_vowels(moose)3>>> count_vowels(scratch)1The Type Contract is the line of a docstring that describes the types of the parameters and return value. Give a Type Contract for this function., Resolved,0
