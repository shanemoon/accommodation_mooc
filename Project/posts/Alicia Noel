Sunday September 29th 2013 1:23 am -04:00,Same errors here. Game works fine for both testing and running the driver but my assignment grade is 33/37. All errors are from the read_board tests.I played the game completely through and everything worked fine. As far as I can tell running read_board(board_file) works just fine too: >>>read_board(board_file)[EFJAJCOWSS SDGKSRFDFF ASRJDUSKLK HEANDNDJWA ANSDNCNEOP PMSNFHHEJE JEPQLYNXDL]At this point Ive spent nearly an entire day on this assignment with several hours spent trying to troubleshoot this last error. Im just going to have to accept the 33/37 :(, Unresolved,0
