Sunday August 18th 2013 11:57 pm -04:00,Im using Codecademy in tandem with this course but its pissing me off at the moment. The interpreter keeps crashing at the PygLatin lessons. It was the first program I tried to learn but then I got annoyed by the frequent crashes that I just learned HTML/CSS jQuery and started on java. Ill probably start PHP and Ruby next or maybe look for additional practice resources. I have two books but they are so boring to read Practical Programming and Bioinformatics Programming. , Pinned Approved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 12:09 am -04:00,...OK so maybe I was getting pissed off for no reason...It wasnt really crashing more like waiting for me to enter a reply into the interpreter for the code I created. original = raw_input(Write something anything!), Pinned Approved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 12:36 am -04:00,I have made the weird habit of studying code when I forbid myself from playing video games. Just until the semester ends though. Ive already got 10+ games just itching to be played but I cant...the wonders of pharmacotherapeutics calls. Ill try to look into the hard way which they claim is the easier way of learning python later on. I kind of like the feedback I get on Codecademy by having all aspects combined rather than just reading directly from a book. Its a little like a game in itself I like the reward system., Pinned Approved,0

Sunday August 18th 2013 11:34 pm -04:00,I have already downloaded python 3.3.2 but Im not sure if the other things I downloaded do anything. First I downloaded ActiveTcl-8.5.pkg. Im not sure why its even there. Not sure for what tclvfse or Wish 8.5 are used for.I have WingIDE had to download XQuartz for it to work but Im not sure if it has any use either.Xcode was a pretty large file from the App store but still Im not sure if it works for python.Anyone know if those programs matter or if I can just delete them?, Unresolved,0
