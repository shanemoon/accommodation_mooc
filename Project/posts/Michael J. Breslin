Monday September 9th 2013 7:17 pm -04:00,I have tried the first UTC one a lot of times. I successfully completed the earlier ones. I feel Im wasting too much time and therefore falling behind in the course. Is there not some better way to guide those of us who are stuck. , Unresolved,1

Tuesday September 10th 2013 12:45 pm -04:00,....when I applied the % 24 following the formula.... (Richard Baker) This is a critical piece of information. I knew I was close to resolving this one as I was getting all of the scenarios correct except for two. Putting in an extra pair of parentheses and moving %24 outside has cracked this one for me! Thanks Richard, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 1:08 pm -04:00,So as my earlier comment says. I was able to resolve time_to_utc when I tried what Richard Baker suggested. The time_from_utc is then a matter of using the same formula but changing the polarity of the sign between the two parentheses.  , Unresolved,0
