Friday August 23rd 2013 9:58 pm -04:00,I also am quite new to this and have to watch the videos multiple times. The videos seem well done its just memorizing the terminology that is difficult for me. I plan on studying a little more before attempting the first assignment., Unresolved,1

Saturday September 7th 2013 9:18 pm -04:00,given that it wont matter at that time?having trouble starting w/ Step #3 on Assignment #1. Watched videos a minimum of 2X/each and am still at a roadblock. I gathered from one thread & the handout that answers only involve utilizing the proper operands and that the functions are rather short in length? Im a little behind as had to work all last w/e which was out of the ordinary. Been banging my head on the wall trying to figure out the operand for Step #3. to no avail thus far, Unresolved,0
