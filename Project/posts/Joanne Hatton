Friday August 30th 2013 11:29 am -04:00,Apologies if Im wrong but from my understanding and the way i wrote my code each function is evaluated separately and each should only accept seconds and give you out one value in either seconds minutes or hours depending on the function. I think you may be overcomplicating what it is asking you to do. I did the same thing with the last two functions and it is actually a lot simpler than you may think., Unresolved,0
