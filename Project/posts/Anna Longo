Wednesday August 21st 2013 11:18 pm -04:00,Having downloaded the ebook to go the exercises in Chaps 2 and 3 I cannot find the solutions to check my work. The book indicated that solutions are available at the listed link (see below) but that link resolves back to the ebook POS,None,1
Thursday August 29th 2013 10:20 am -04:00,I am having trouble connecting the 1st part of the lesson in Week 2 with the 1st quiz. I understand conceptually the diff between a func with return and a func with print and that the function Square_return will return the value while square print will show the value once calculated.So  The exercise presents a func without a return - so yes there would be no value produced.But then a variable result gets the result of calling sumso why doesnt the other variable new_result  get the result of the variable result + 1? I dont see how new_result =  result  + 1 is NonType Isnt new_result = result + 1 simply an expression to be evaluated?Consider this code:def sum(number1 number2):    print(number1 + number2)result = sum(1 3)new_result = result + 1, Unresolved,1
Thursday August 29th 2013 6:29 pm -04:00,Ok this is helpful so can you confirm my revised thinking?So the job of function sum as defined in the exercise is to print.Therefore we can get call the arguments in the function sum and assign them to the variable result but the variable result itself has no value because the function sum did not return a valueand the new_result =result + 1 was just extra stuff, Unresolved,0
