Saturday September 7th 2013 2:18 pm -04:00,Hi guys! I have a question in the textbook pp.112: if _name_ == _main_:    print(I am the main program.)else:    print(Another module is importing me.)When I run it and the message is:>>> Traceback (most recent call last):  File C:/Users/Fujitsu/Desktop/Python_file/main_example.py line 1 in <module>    if _name_ == _main_:NameError: name _name_ is not defined>>> Whats wrong is it? Thanks!,None,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 3:13 pm -04:00,Thanks a lot! But the book did not define it before why?Additionally on pp.111 it says Python defines a special string variable called _name_ in every module to help us figure this out.What does it mean? Thanks!,None,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 3:40 pm -04:00,Thank you very much! It is just like __builtins__ on pp.108. I got it!Thanks again!!,None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 9:57 pm -04:00,Hi guys I have a question in the book pp.151:What is the memory model of the following codes:values = [0 1 2]values[1] = valuesWhen I ran it the result is:>>> values = [0 1 2]>>> values[1] = values>>> values[0 [...] 2]What does it mean? I think it is a loop inside the variable values is that true? Thanks!,None,1
Thursday September 12th 2013 10:19 pm -04:00,So that means it can display in your computer? I mean [0 [0 1 2] 2]?,None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 10:25 pm -04:00,Yes! that is what I really mean. It is a infinite nested list is that right?,None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 10:29 pm -04:00,No it is an exercise and no answer. It requires to draw the memory model of this statement.,None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 10:46 pm -04:00,Yes it is! I think it is an interesting nested list which insists of infinite lists inside position [1]. Just like:x=2√x=\sqrt { 2 }   x=2+x−−−−√x=\sqrt{2+x},None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 11:04 pm -04:00,This is another guys answer in Python Community:You have created a recursive data structure. The memory model is that value[1] contains a pointer back to the whole values list. So there is no finite way to print the whole thing unless you can print arrows back to the beginning.                                          ,None,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 5:28 pm -04:00,Hi guys can you help me to correct the code below:s=[1 2 3 -3 6 -1 -3 1]def f(num_list):     (list of number) -> None    Remove the negtive numbers from the list num_list.    >>> numbers = [-5 1 -3 2]    >>> f(numbers)    [1 2]        for i in num_list:        if i < 0:            num_list.remove(i)    return num_listWhen f(s) is executed it produces [1 2 3 6 -3 1] which is not right answer.How to correct it? Thanks!!,None,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 5:43 pm -04:00,I have a solution but I am not sure if there is any better one.s=[1 2 3 -3 6 -1 -3 1]def f(num_list):     (list of number) -> None    Remove the negtive numbers from the list num_list.    >>> numbers = [-5 1 -3 2]    >>> f(numbers)    [1 2]        result=    for i in num_list:        if i >= 0:            result.append(i)    return resultPlease help me thanks a lot!!,None,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 6:39 pm -04:00,In my opinion L.remove() should be used carefully as it will skip some indices. That is why I choose L.append() finally. But I still try to know how to use L.remove() to execute that programme.,None,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 6:47 pm -04:00,I like this codes!!Thank you very much!!!,None,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 6:02 pm -04:00,Hi guys! I am a Python beginner and so excited in this course!!I am trying to practice Python in my study and other interesting problems such as Project Euler. As a result I wrote some codes in Blogger and hope everyone to correct my codes and discuss with me. Thanks a lot!!My Blogger link is:http://ameenzhao.blogspot.com/,None,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 6:07 pm -04:00,Method Description:Run all methods in this TestCase whose name begin with test_.           Run self.setup() before and self.teardown() after.

Wednesday September 25th 2013 6:44 pm -04:00,Actually I have tested every function and they run so well. But I do not know why the score is zero!!, Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 6:22 am -04:00,Method Description:NoneMessage:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Expected no value to be returned.What does it mean? I used another previous function inside this function and the example can work well. But why it is wrong???Thanks!, Unresolved,0
