Thursday August 29th 2013 7:55 pm -04:00,I dont have internet at home. I can get free WiFi at the library though the computers which they limit to 2 hours use do not allow installing python. I wondered about using a flash drive to run python on library computer or to use the free internet to download the materials so I can refer to them when completing the assignments on my computer at home.Fyi. I am a beginner programmer so this will be very challenging to me- I have been out of school for long time!,None,0
