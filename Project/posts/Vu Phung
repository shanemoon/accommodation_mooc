Monday August 19th 2013 12:18 am -04:00,During the lecture of variable. I ran the code for the area of triangle.My issue was that the area variable didnt refer to the new values I assigned to the base and height variablesExample>>>base = 20>>>height = 12>>>area = base * height/2>>>area>>>120.0>>>base = 2.5>>>height = 7>>>area>>>120.0The variable area still points to base = 20 and Â height =12. Unless I rewrite this line >>>area = base * height/2 after I assigned the new values to the base and height, Resolved,0
