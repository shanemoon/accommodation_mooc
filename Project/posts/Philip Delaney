Wednesday August 28th 2013 5:15 pm -04:00,Here are the notes I took in trying to get my head around it...hope it helpsexample:def sum(number1 number2):return(number1 + number2)SAVE AND RUN MODULE THEN >>> result = sum(1 3)............. (nothingprinted...Return only allocated a memory address containing “4”to the variable “result”>>> new_result = result + 1..........(nothingprinted....only allocated a memory address containing “5” to thevariable “new_result”>>> result4>>> new_result5and playing around...>>> print(result new_result)4 5>>> result new_result(4 5)>>> CHANGING THE FUNCTION TO “PRINT” def sum(number1 number2):    print(number1 + number2)Save + Run it then>>> result = sum(1 3)4	(“4” printed straight away as thats what you asked thefunction to do...but it didnt save anything against variable“result”) >>> print(result)None  (see?....................so it cant add anything to this “nonetype”)>>> new_result = result + 1Traceback (mostrecent call last):  File<pyshell#39> line 1 in <module>    new_result= result + 1TypeError:unsupported operand type(s) for +: NoneType and int, Resolved,8

Monday September 2nd 2013 4:59 pm -04:00,sorry my examples were wrong. ignore me., Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 6:37 pm -04:00,same here..I assume their tester will test for times off the hour mark but ...my question is...(before I waste time on the wrong asumption)...if the time is say 15.30 (3.30pm) should the float parameter read 15.5 or 15.30? i.e the number of hrs since midnight or the actual clock time ?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 6:50 pm -04:00,okay Ill go with that! , Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 8:17 am -04:00,Inputting the number of seconds as a parameter does not match with the examples given in the doc string.I will just go with a straight float. , Unresolved,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 4:26 pm -04:00,When I click on the link I get a completelyh different code to that in that shown in the test. Am I missing something? This is what I get in the visualiser:x = [1 2 3]y = [4 5 6]z = yy = xx = zx = [1 2 3] # a different [1 2 3] list!y = xx.append(4)y.append(5)z = [1 2 3 4 5] # a different list!x.append(6)y.append(7)y = hellodef foo(lst):    lst.append(hello)    bar(lst)def bar(myLst):    print(myLst)foo(x)foo(z), Resolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 10:06 am -04:00,Thanks.It was Noscript (script blocker) which caused the problem. Unsafe reload allowed the correct code to be seen., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:20 pm -04:00,I dont have programming skills apart from BASIC back in the 80s but managed to get the last 2 done.I normally break the questions down line by line in plain english to get my head around how to do it and then translate that into pythonfor the last 2... I might think...so if the first letter is A then the first letter of the returned string has to be Tthen I have to look up the 2nd letter and if it is C then G has to be added to the string...hmmmmthat normally points me in the right directionI assume as more and more items are added to our knowledge it might get harder to actually do assignments as we will have more options to choose from which will be less fresh in the mind, Unresolved,1
Monday September 16th 2013 6:12 am -04:00,Hi You are not looking to add anything to the original sequence but to replace it altogether with a string made up of the complements of each nucleotide in the original string ... basically swapping each character to its complementAT should return TA....i.e every occourence of A in the original should be replaced by T in the returned stringCAG should return GTCetc, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:42 pm -04:00,according to the output...zero length should be valid. I have mine as True for zero length and passed that test, Resolved,1
Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:46 pm -04:00,I have tries all the examples you mention and my shell give the correct answer for each...but I still failed on submission with _invalid_capital_letter, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:49 pm -04:00,Same problem as above for me. I also get this...although lowercase work in every test in my shell(i.e. return False)Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not false : Have you tested your function with lowercase letters?, Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 12:00 pm -04:00,OKaaay main lesson learnt for me here is .....if I am looking for (str) -> bool ...then putting quotes around something = True or Falsereturns a string and not a bool. Now 24 from 24, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:58 pm -04:00,assuming dna is your parameter...you are asking above if the sequence ( for example the dna sequence AGTCGA)  is in (is a subset of) the string A......, Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 5:58 am -04:00,we would need to know which ones you were failed on, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 10:46 am -04:00,a very short expression is all that is needed to point to the required digit (5) in the list of lists.They say addition is not allowed because it would only make things more complicated by adding various numbers to make up 5. 5 is already there.Imagine you wanted to print the number 5 from the lists you would enter print(....................).Since parentheses are not allowed just remove the print and the parentheses from the expression and 5 will pop up on the screen anyway, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 12:24 pm -04:00,Thanks Tom. I never would have got that on my own. I must have missed or forgotten something along the way, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 4:45 pm -04:00,I was having a hard time crawling up to 24. Then I decided to run the driver module  . This shows where you are going wrong then you can look at the line that is calling the incorrect function in a3.py and it gives you an idea what it is looking forFor example in the last 2 I was looking to open a file but after running the driver and being stopped at these 2 functions in a3 I saw that the driver is opening the file itself and then I understood that my function is only stripping the newlines.I was also able to correct another couple of functions easily after running the driver again  and now I only have 4 errors left., Unresolved,1
Tuesday October 1st 2013 4:51 pm -04:00,basically  the driver opens the file dialog box for you to open your wordfile (the  words to be listed in the wordfile are listed on the assignment handout - create a .txt file in the same directory as a3 and copy and paste those 4 words to it).when the driver asks for you to select a wordfile you delect this file.Then the driver links to the words_file function you are defining and uses your function to read the words with the newline character removed.Same with boards_file. When the driver opens  the board_file it asked you to select (again save the example board in the handout as a .txt file) it uses your function to strip the newlines and print the board to the screen 1 line at a time. , Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 7:47 pm -04:00,you dont need to use that variable. The driver uses that From the driver:# Load the words list.words_file = askopenfile(mode=r title=Select word list file)words = a3.read_words(words_file)at the start of the game the driver asks the player to choose what word file to load into the game and when it is chosen uses YOUR definition read_words(words_file): to strip the newline characters from the wordfile and return the words in a list of str, Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:18 pm -04:00,7 weeks done and now I discover there were lecture notes ...lolI use this site for additional info:http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_dictionary.htm, Resolved,1
