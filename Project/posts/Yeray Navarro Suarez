Sunday September 8th 2013 5:50 pm -04:00,You´ve got the right answer here., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 3:19 pm -04:00,I used (str) -> number but it didn´t work this is the most similar thing I find to this what he explained. (number) -> number but it was wrong but the explantion says:The answer is of the form:(____) -> ____where the lines are replaced with Python types to describe the parameter(s) and return value.When referring to a string use str.  When referring to an integer use int. I was not so far away from (str) so maybe is (str) -> int but in that why they use this? (number) -> number  it confuses me. The other option to this is (word) -> number. , Resolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 4:05 pm -04:00,Yes that is the answer (str) -> int. So I should think that number is used when you can have either float or int. What you says seems to be logic and I tried again and yessss i the correct answer but read this explanation of the next question which correct answer was (word):Here are two example calls for the function count_vowels:>>> count_vowels(moose)3>>> count_vowels(scratch)1Which of the following would be the best name for the count_vowels parameter?vowelsword CORRECT ONEinputintExplanationParameter names should not be too generic (input could equally well describe the parameters to any function).  Types like str and int should NOT be used as parameter names.It confuses a little bit it´s like getting the driving license in Spain hahahah. Thank´s Alain I have it now completely clear., Resolved,1
Sunday September 8th 2013 6:56 am -04:00,When you write a function you have to put some information so you can know what that function do I think it´s ok until here. In that information you put an example of what it do>>> count_vowels(moose)3>>> count_vowels(scratch)1 A description:   The function count_vowels returns the number of vowels in a given word (a str)And the type contract that especifies what type of (parameter/s) -> values returns.All together looks like this:    (parameter type) -> value type       The function count_vowels returns the number of vowels in a given word (a str)    >>> count_vowels(moose)    3     >>> count_vowels(scratch)    1For example: Functiondef hello(myname): this is the parameter and is a string (str)    return Hello!  + mynamehello(yeray)Hello! yeray ->>> this is the result value and is a string (str)The type contract here is (str) -> str______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________def math(number): this is the parameter and is a number (number)      return numbermath(1)1 -> this is the result value and is a number (number)the Type Contract here is (number) -> numberWhen we don´t know if the numbers are integers (int = real numbers withou decimals) or float (float: numbers with decimals)or both you use the type number if you know the value of the result has to be an integer you use (int) or is it has to be a float you use (float).def math(number): this is the parameter and is a number (float)      return numbermath(1.0)1.0 -> this is the result value and is a number (float)the Type Contract here is (float) -> floatetc...I hope it helps., Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 8:40 am -04:00,What I understand is that the expression should find de second occurrence of s2s2 = B A N A N A - second occurrenceand if that occurrence doesn´t happen in s1:s1 - B A N A N A       B A N A N A return -1For me the confussing word is occurrence does it mean coincidence or letter? is not the same to get the second letter of the s2 or the second occurrence(coincidence? repetition?).If this is the case s2 = B A N A N A s1 should be a long word that repeats otherwise the operation won´t continue.Can you clear me these?, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 10:27 pm -04:00,Hi I subscribe to the course when it was advanced I subscribe at night so I started the next day I saw al videos and when I did de first excercise I found that I couldn´t have credits because the hardline expired the day before. My question is if you let people subscribe once the course is started you should put a hardline in base of when people subscribe otherwise it´s not fair. I did everything in one day tomorrow I will be up to date with everything (video lectures exercises and second assigment) even when I started two weeks later but I don´t have the same chance to get the credits of the first excercise just because I started one day later from hardline. Please think about it.Regard´s Yeray,None,-1
Saturday September 14th 2013 11:03 pm -04:00,For me everything matters the information and the certificate. I don´t miss anything I have done in two weeks what others have done in four and making other courses too and I´m still in time as I said I will finish week 4 tomorrow (today) and assingment 4. I would think is not fair even in a real class. Is great to study here but because I make the effort and take it seriously I think also it was fair for me to ask for it. I don´t think I am doing aynthing wrong just asking or sending a thought.Anyway I love coursera and the opportunity I have to study but that doesn´t mean that I cannot talk about something that could make coursera much more better than it is now. Regard´s ,None,-1
Sunday September 15th 2013 12:28 am -04:00,Sure Tom you are right but I haven´t say that others cannot share their opinion´s . Thank´s anonymous it would be great if I could add that 5% but anyway I think is a good idea for the future to think about cases like this one coursera is incredible and it can be much more perfect than it is.,None,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 5:52 am -04:00,Alain I have been working for 5 years as web designer. I don´t write code that is why I´m here to finally learn to write it but I have seen and manipulate it too many times to know that implementing that is not a big deal. I don´t think it will change the hole business model to give a few more days in base of when you start the course as I said if you let people start later let them get the chance to get their credits in some way. I didn´t found any answers even I started the course two weeks later and that is because you cannot give any answer doesn´t matter how much time has passed. Forum code of coduct3. Post appropriate content. Content that violates the Honor Code or Terms of Service is not permitted. What is Honor Code?3. I will not make solutions to homework quizzes or exams available to anyone else. This includes both solutions written by me as well as any official solutions provided by the course staff.But in case you could give answers lots of forums has an option called spoliers and there can be the answers if ithey has to be.You are talkiing about special deadline I am talking about a deadline according to when you start the course or at least give two days from the day you start. In a place with honest people it should not be a problem and all these is based in honesty so time really doesn´t matters.Now I ask you imagine a person that discover the course in week number seven they let them do the course this guy has time and study hard in one week to make all video lectures exercises and assigments but he probably would´t get the certificate because he started later. Do you really think the effort of that guy doesn´t deserve that credits beacuse is not fair for the rest of students even if he worked as harder or more than others?. Why should others get the certificate and that person not beacuse he started later? in equal conditions and being honest with the work even having less time he is deserving the credits and certificate. Extreme case but is an example to explain my point of view.Anyway nice conversationHave a nice day... or night,None,0

Monday September 16th 2013 3:13 pm -04:00,Dipali your code is giving the index of the first occurrence in s1:B A N A N AA P P L Eyou have to finish the code so you can get the index of the second occurrence in s1:B A N A N AA P P L EAs you know if there is no occurrence results -1 and should be in one expression. Try to keep your expression as clear and simple as you can. Anyway you are going in the right way but your code is not finished., Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 2:54 pm -04:00,Why did they deleted the comments there was no code written I don´t understan I have seen posts with most of the correct code in there and they are not deleted and the comments dissapears? no one has told me the answer just told me if these examples are correct what´s the problem with that? there are also examples in the exercise. If there is any doubt about it I can paste all comments here and see there is nothing strange related with the honor code. I hope it is an error., Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 17th 2013 7:42 pm -04:00,Also I am having problems with the type contract:  >>> last_vowel(cauliflower)    eShould be:  >>> last_vowel(cauliflower)    eOtherwise the doctest.testmod() give an example failure :Failed example:    last_vowel(cauliflower)Expected:    eGot:    eBut if I change that and delete de None from de type contract:  >>> last_vowel(pfft)  everything goes fine. So we have two options to choose. >>> last_vowel(pfft) orreturn print(None)I am not going to think much more I see it clear the code do what it is supposed to do give the last vowel or None (nothing)., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 4:51 am -04:00,What I did also passed the doctest and there is no need to change (str) -> str | None. If I have to change somenthing I would change return print(None) is more logic for me than adding str | None., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 5:13 am -04:00,def last_vowel(s):    (str) -> str    Return the last vowel in s if one exists; otherwise return None.        >>> last_vowel(cauliflower)    e    >>> last_vowel(pfft) # returns None    None        i = len(s) - 1    while i >= 0:        if s[i] in aeiouAEIOU:            return s[i]        i = i - 1    return print(None)This is the same and passes doctest perfectly., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 5:21 pm -04:00,Yeah I understand you are right but the code is in the case you want you print None you can print whatever you want but cases are different and they must be treated in different ways. There is the other way just leaving it blank and use return None. >>> last_vowel(pfft)   It also pass the doctest and It is returning None (or blank). I don´t think is at all neccesary to use or None is obvious that if there are no vowels it will return None(nothing) as you say is a documentation for ourselves. I don´t think my code is doing something   oppossed to what it has to do I think is doing it in a different way maybe not the best but the function is returning the values it has to return in this context. For me this second option is the best.One thing the code you wrote will give a syntax error., Unresolved,0
