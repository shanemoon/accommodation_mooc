Monday September 16th 2013 12:22 am -04:00,Hi!  Im having a problem finding info to show me what Im missing when it comes to these count_nucleotides failures.  The function is returning the result not printing it.  Failures:student: test_a2.TestCountNucleotides.test_count_nucleotides_examples_from_docstringFAILURE: AssertionError0 != 2 : Have you tested your function on the examples in the docstring?student: test_a2.TestCountNucleotides.test_count_nucleotides_examples_other_nucleotidesFAILURE: AssertionError0 != 2 : Have you tested your function on all four nucleotides?Both tests are resulting in 0.  Where as in idle count_nucleotides is working as expected.Idle results:>>> count_nucleotides(ATCGGC G)2>>> count_nucleotides(AAAAAATCGGC A)6>>> count_nucleotides(ATCTA G)0>>> count_nucleotides(ATCGGC G)2>>> count_nucleotides(ATCTA C)1>>> count_nucleotides(ATCTA T)2As stated earlier the code is returning not printing the result. At least I think it is! Included are a few lines of the code for functions above and below just to satisfy the idea of any possible funny business.The Code:...  b=len(dna2)    return a>bdef count_nucleotides(dna nucleotide):     (str str) -> int    Return the number of occurrences of nucleotide in the DNA sequence dna.    >>> count_nucleotides(ATCGGC G)    2    >>> count_nucleotides(ATCTA G)    0        r=0    for char in dna:        if char is nucleotide:            r=r+1    return rdef contains_sequence(dna1 dna2):     (str str) -> bool...Thanks!Ive not had success finding info on the combo of assertion errors + Nucleotides.  I figure my searching skills are simply poor though and this had to have been answered by now so thanks for taking another trip to redundancy to help out!, Resolved,1
