Tuesday August 20th 2013 4:13 pm -04:00,Yes the new description is clearer thank you! but also I agree with Larry. My main mistake was the following:  at first I thought that result of a new expression would be the same as in the original one. And of course the new expression would be equivalent to the original one otherwise it would be a completely different expression.
