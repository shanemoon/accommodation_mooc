Wednesday August 28th 2013 5:49 pm -04:00,You need to use to_24_hour_clock to correctly evaluate the result., Unresolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 5:45 pm -04:00,After submitting my assignment and I view the feedback a small table is presented with 5 columns. The columns are unlabelled. The first appears to be the total score for the assignment. What are the other four columns?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 1:22 pm -04:00,Review the video on Importing. The answer lies around the 4 minute mark., Resolved,1
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:04 am -04:00,Just review the video lectures - its all in there., Resolved,2
Monday September 2nd 2013 11:49 pm -04:00,Given that the input is hours minutes and seconds and that there are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute all you need to do is convert all that into hours and return that number. Use the docstring examples to guide you., Unresolved,3
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:14 am -04:00,You can do it in one line using simple arithmetic. Consider that 100 + 20 + 3 = 123 then 100 hours + 20 minutes + 3 seconds should be as easy. You just need to add a minute->hour and a second->hour conversion., Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:22 am -04:00,You dont really. All the precondition means is that the input value must be in the range specified. If you were writing a larger program where you called this function then you might verify the precondition before calling the function., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 4:37 pm -04:00,Thats right Camoya. But it is really simple arithmetic. Consider a similar example of fractional addition. If you want to add 1/2 + 2/3 + 5/6 you first convert to the lowest common denominator. 3/6 + 4/6 + 5/6 becomes very easy to add together. Think of hours as the lowest common denominator. Convert all three to hours and add together., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 9:49 am -04:00,Christian youve almost got it right. However it looks like you have literally taken the Python type int from the docstring and used them as variable names. Instead what you should be using are the names you pass into the function within the def statement. Try that and it should work., Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 4th 2013 12:40 pm -04:00,The docstring is right. Your calculation is wrong. To get the final answer in hours add number of hours number of minutes in an hour (a fraction) and number of seconds in an hour (a smaller fraction). , Unresolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 12:47 pm -04:00,Recall from the instructions that you need to call function to_24_hour_clock in order to get the right answer., Resolved,2
Tuesday September 10th 2013 12:31 am -04:00,So I was thinking I needed to reference the position in the string being used in a for loop. For examplefor char in sample_string:     print(sample_string[char])This example gives me an error since char is the string value of each character in sample_string. How can I write the for loop so I can refer to sample_string[0] sample_string[1] sample_string[2] ... etc?, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:20 am -04:00,That was what I came up with but I didnt want to add a new variable. Rather I am looking for something within the for x in y command., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:21 am -04:00,Thanks that works!, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 8:44 pm -04:00,Able to submit once per hour? Pure luxury! Listen sonny when I was a young man we didnt have our own computer. We just had a terminal pool and we had to sign up for a time slot and wait for our turn to punch in our code. And when we had to submit it was to an overnight batch queue. We were only able to see our results the next morning. We counted ourselves fortunate if we had two maybe three successful compiles per week., Resolved,2
Wednesday September 11th 2013 1:06 pm -04:00,Youre overthinking the problem. Youve got all the right code and then some. Remove the references to variable counter and try again., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 5:00 pm -04:00,Copy and paste the code to IDLE and run a few examples. You can also copy it to the Python Visualizer and step through the code., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 9:51 pm -04:00,When I ran the function it gave a syntax error. When I returned to IDLE the return statement was highlighted even though the syntax error was on the previous line. Why did it do that?, Resolved,0
