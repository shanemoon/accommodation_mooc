Saturday September 28th 2013 5:35 pm -04:00,This isnt a question or even a call for help.  Its a gripe.  My read_board() tests were failing even when my function returned the correct value.  I changed how read_board() worked using hints in this thread and got a perfect score but the list my read_board function returned was exactly the same in both versions!  In the interpreter I checked it with ==>>> [[E F J A J C O W S S] [S D G K S R F D F F] [A S R J D U S K L K] [H E A N D N D J W A] [A N S D N C N E O P] [P M S N F H H E J E] [J E P Q L Y N X D L]] == [[E F J A J C O W S S] [S D G K S R F D F F] [A S R J D U S K L K] [H E A N D N D J W A] [A N S D N C N E O P] [P M S N F H H E J E] [J E P Q L Y N X D L]]TrueThe first list is from the version with failing tests and the second list is from the version with passing tests.In my first version I converted each line in the file to a list and removed the last element of the list because it was the newline character.  In my second version I removed the newline character from the line while it was still a string and then converted it to a list.  Both ways result in exactly the same returned value.If there was really anything wrong with my first version I still dont understand it., Unresolved,0
