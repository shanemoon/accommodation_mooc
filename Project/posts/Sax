Tuesday August 20th 2013 3:15 pm -04:00,Hello!I normally use Python 2.7 for my school projects and assignments thats the installation I currently have in my Win7-64 bit mainly because they ask me to use that version.Is it possible to have another installation (Python 3 ofc)? Maybe a portable installation will do but Im not sure if it wont have PATH issues or something., Resolved,0
