Monday September 23rd 2013 7:22 pm -04:00,Hi!What could you say about web-development on Python?What is the best tools and frameworks (besides Django) on this language which work out of the box. Especially when I want to build an adaptive user interface like here: http://verbling.com or here: http://couchsurfing.comThe web-driven engines oriented on the magazines and prepared for use are also interesting but they should be also flexible and potentially extendable by functionality.,None,0
