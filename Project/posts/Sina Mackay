Tuesday October 1st 2013 9:42 pm -04:00,Im glad to read that Im not the only one! This was way more confusing than all the loops I got quite upset while doing the homework on this^^ (which I usually dont). It began with figuring out that I have to change the escape characters in my file path into forward slashes. I dont really know what exactly about the read commands is so confusing but learning those just seems like a huge pain in the neck :/, Unresolved,0
