Friday October 4th 2013 8:20 am -04:00,I missed the fun part until I read this:http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/boolean.html...a more elaborate definition is needed if an operand is not Boolean.val = a or bmeansif bool(a):    val = aelse:    val = band in a similar vein:val = a and bmeansif bool(a):    val = belse:    val = a, Resolved,0

Sunday September 15th 2013 8:00 am -04:00,You also need to be sure the sequence is all written on uppercase so test for instance:>>> is_valid_sequence(AtCG)FalseAnd as an empty sequence is regarded as valid test:>>> is_valid_sequence()TrueGood luck everybody!, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 8:20 am -04:00,Boolean values have a definite syntax. Ask yourself:Are True / False or True / False boolean values?Are True / False string values?On the meaning of the answer messages click on FAILURE to get some additional hint about why your code did not pass those specific tests.Have luck., Resolved,0

Thursday September 26th 2013 8:18 pm -04:00,In this course we´re dealing with at most a dozen of lines or so in each exercise and using pre-cooked templates on the assignments. Real life is quite different; we will face hundreds of lines w/o helping clues or templates. It will be us on our own. So getting acquainted with IDLE or any other Python editor for testing and running programs finding syntax errors etc. in a development environment is a must. Pseudocodes and pen and paper are valuable tools indeed but you are supposed to deliver a running debugged and well tested program to your clients. One thing is knowing how a car engine works another different one is designing such an engine that works.  SoIf on the other hand you have been avoiding using IDLE and youre struggling with the exercises (OR NOT) then you arent learning as much as you should., Resolved,0

Sunday September 29th 2013 2:48 am -04:00,IMHO the best way to see how your update_score(player_info word) works is running it on the Visualizer. If you run it on IDLE theres nothing to see (even if your code could be right). Watch for unwanted type changes too: eg. 8 is not the same type as 8., Unresolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 2:02 am -04:00,The board that is returned should not have newline characters in it. This means somewhere in the board youre returning there is at least one  character e.g. [[ABC] .... ]]. The other board not loaded correctly messages might be related to this newlines character failure., Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 8:32 am -04:00,Forget a3_drive.py until you have finished your whole coding. For whatever use you may give to it I added the following temporary code before my actual code to be able to open any file of my choice (in this case wordlist1.txt) while testing it on IDLE. Uncomment (delete the #s) the 2nd 3rd & 4th lines of this temporary code when making tests on IDLE and re-comment them (put the #s again) when submitting your code for evaluation. #Temporary code#    import tkinter.filedialog#    filename = tkinter.filedialog.askopenfilename()#    words_file = open(filenamer)#End of of temporary codeTo call your code on IDLE use any dummy filename e.g.:read_words(x)Hope this helps., Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 7:49 am -04:00,Cioloboc (1) Think about what kind of types are you using in the comparisons. Is word a number or a string? Can you compare a word with a number or ask if it pertains to a given set of numbers?(2) What is the use of the for...in in your code. Do you need it or not?(3) When deciding what to return take into account (from the docstring) that {0123} are points per character for all characters in word.May the Code be with you., Unresolved,0
