Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:54 pm -04:00,Thanks Todd but thats not my question. I just want to know if Im allowed to use functions not discussed in the lectures such as the trunc function. I joined this course about an hour ago so I really have to submit Assignment One. I was able to complete the Assignment using the trunc function., Unresolved,0
