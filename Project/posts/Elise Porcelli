Sunday September 8th 2013 1:24 pm -04:00,I have a question about the Flight status example. Lets say my case is the following: my flight is scheduled to arrive at 23:00 (11pm). But the plane is 2 hours late. The estimated arrival time is 01:00. (1am the day after). In python code:report_status(23.0 1.0)In my particular case scheduled_time > estimated_time python is thus going to say early. But its definitely not true since the plane is 2 hours late! Am I seeing this right? Is there another way that you could show us and that would take into account the days date to avoid this kind of particular cases?, Unresolved,0
