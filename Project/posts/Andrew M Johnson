Wednesday October 2nd 2013 11:54 pm -04:00,I am having just some basic trouble with this still and it is really starting to impact my understanding of other concepts.  My question is basically this how does Python know that I am doing a for loop over the index as opposed to just a normal for loop?  Is it the presence of i as the first item specified in the for loop?  Because I thought when I didfor i in teami was just a variable and I could pick anything I wanted.  Or is it triggering it being a loop in the index because I have for i in range(term)?I hope this makes sense thanks, Resolved,0
