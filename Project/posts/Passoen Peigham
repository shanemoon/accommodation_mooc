Friday September 6th 2013 10:25 pm -04:00,Yes I did it as you guys told me and now it works. I am trying to builda program which can ask questions and give predefined answers. At the moment itknows only two questions but now I know how to write the code it should be noproblem to add more questions. Eventually it should have enough to form a 2minute (predefined) conversation: P. Thank you for the advice Etienne and Tom.I appreciate the help.,None,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 7:59 am -04:00,I got another question. Now I have this code and I can run it in thePython command line. But I would rather have it in a box with a clear designlike we are usually used to on the internet. Or in a command prompt like java.I am somewhat familiar with html css and java. I know how to combine them witheach other but it do not know how to combine them with python. I got twoquestions.1.What would be the better option? Should I only use python and would thatrequire a lot more knowledge or is it something we are going to discuss in thelectures soon? 2. Orshould I combine python with any of these languages to give it a clear design?And if so could you give me a bit of direction with this. I also understoodfrom somebody else that if I would like to use python in a html document Iwould have to do it online because otherwise I would not see the python code onmy own computer in a .html document?groetenuit Nederlandgreetings,None,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 9:47 am -04:00,Thank you for your response. What method would you advise and could youexplain me why? Imyself could think of one main preference and that is being able to share itwith others who do not know how python or programming in general works. Wouldone of these options fit more to this preference?,None,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:01 am -04:00,IntroNext tothis course I’m trying to learn programming with Python by writing own programsbased upon what we learn from this course and other sources. In the best casethese would be programs which could really help me out with certain activitiesand everyday live. So I tried to think of a subject I could experiment with andwhich could eventually provide me with a very handy program. This brought me to the issue of having too many passwords to be able toremember them all while not wanting to write them down because somebody mightfind it and while not wanting to reuse the same passwords for differentapplications because that would increase the risks. The programThe last few courses brought me to an idea. I could write a program which wouldfirst of all try to recognize me by asking something only I could know. Itcould be a password or something else. By giving that it would grant me access.After having access I would have to call a function different ones fordifferent passwords and applications. After calling the function Python willthen give me the correct password. And here comes the tricky part I would notwant the function to just return a password as a string because that would bevery weak. I would like it to form the password by getting every letter one by oneas a substring from a large index/list of letters. The list would contain the alphabetseveral times but then not in the logical order we are used to but in a randomorder. The function would have to return the different letters by searching fortheir index number within the list and then concatenate them with each otherand print them as a string which would be the password. Reasons why?- With this code I would not have to write my passwords on a sheet of paper ora document on my computer so nobody can find it. - I would have to write it in the python.py document but that would not matterbecause I assume the average person from where I live does not know how toprogram with python and without that knowledge they could open and read but notunderstand the code. - Even if they would have some knowledge working with the large list would makeit very time consuming and difficult to find the letters because it would be amaze of many letters in a random order. - It would also not matter if somebody would run the program because they wouldneed to answer the first question.- If there would be somebody knowledgeable enough to hack the program then itwould not matter because with or without the program he would have known enoughto hack it anyways  :P. - I could also give the program and document a misleading name and notsomething like password.py.To sum it up it would be an easy program to write using the methods we learnedin week 1 to 4. It would make it possible for me to find password I forget andsave them in a safe way. Where you can help meI would like to know what you guys think about this. Critique about the methodis more than welcome. - Could you name certain weaknesses? - Could you think of a better method which would still be possible to writewith the knowledge only attained from the first 4 weeks? PS: I assume programs for this already exist. I know they are much better andsafer. But as I said it is not only useful but it is also a way of learning forme and it gives a feeling of comfort to work with programs you have madeyourself.,None,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 8:08 am -04:00,I was thinking about a list/maze of different random letters. But withinthat a slice. After typing my answer it would be compared to the slice to see whetherit is the same and if so it would return True. This way the password would bein the .py document but it would be time consuming and difficult to find it. Ifsomebody would be able to read the code in the first place. I ask myself whetherit would be a better option to save it in another document but if I am correctthe documents would need to be in the same folder so that wouldn’t reallychange a lot because the document would still be easy to find. ,None,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:25 am -04:00,@Uddyalok: It is mainly meant as a security measure against people whomanage to steal my computer find it when lost or access my computer when I amnot around. It is not really against people with knowledge of programming likehackers. So my main goal is to store my passwords in a file which only I canread or get access to. Having other people open and read it is not really anissue as long as they cannot read or understand the code. I amplanning to just run the program in the Python command line. I don’tunderstand the part about generating password because it is supposed to be afile where I can save already existing passwords.@Nick. Are you asking it to pull out specific letters from specificstrings to form your password? Or is there a specific string within a stringwhich is your password or answer?Thefirst one I would like to write a function which would pull the differentstring combine them and form the password and print that. And then I wouldmake if statements for different passwords. For example if I would inputCoursera then a certain if statement would pull the strings for the Courserapassword concatenate them together and print it in the Python command line.Encryptionis something I do not know much about but I will definitively take a look at.,None,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:10 am -04:00,I just started a new thread about trying to write my own password retrieving program. That brought me to the idea of starting a topic where people can tell about their own projects which they are trying to accomplish by using the knowledge we gain from this course. Maybe we can help each other with tips and suggestions or maybe we can bring each other to certain ideas. I myself came to idea of writing a program where I can save all the passwords I have and which can retrieve them form me after it managed to recognize me by making me answer a certain question. This way I would not be dependable upon different website/applications and their password retrieval procedure and neither would I have to write the passwords down and risk other people finding it. So what are you working on?,None,1

Saturday October 5th 2013 9:24 am -04:00,Still havent found a solution. I have read some explanations given in other post but it looks like my code matches the given preconditions., Resolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 11:57 am -04:00,I have the following code:while row_index in range(len(board)):             if word in make_str_from_row(board row_index):                      return True    else:             return FalseFor some reason it works in the Visualizer but it does not work in my Python shell. I keep getting an error saying: NameError: global name row_index is not defined. But i dont understand why the visualizer does not give this error and therefore i also do not understand what is wrong with this code. I tested it in the visualizer and it does make a distinction between good and wrong testwords giving me the matching bolean operator. Can somebody explain this to me?, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 12:31 pm -04:00,The code contains another function so maybe the problem might be there but i already passed those and got 3 points each for the second and third functions., Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 1:30 pm -04:00,I changed the code. Now my code is exactly the same as the one mentionedby Tom. After doing so I passed one test for word in row but not 3 others. Ilooked up the failures and they still mention row_index. So I do not anymoreget the error message when I run the module but I still get the errorafterwards. I think my code make string from row has an error but I can’t findout what because I don’t have any errors for that function. I would like topost it because I presume it is wrong but I can’t because it does not giveerrors and therefore might not be wrong :P and it would be against the policy., Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 1:43 pm -04:00,From the autograder. I tested the code in the visualizer and the pythonshell. The autograder is the only one that gives me an error., Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 2:36 pm -04:00,I have the following code:string =     for i in range(len(board[row_index])):        string = string + i    return stringIt works when i test it and i also passed with it and got the points. But for some reason it is still wrong. The autograder gives me errors when i run the given board_contains_word_in_row function while using the make_str_from_row function inside it. It says that global name row_index is not defined. Could somebody help me with this?, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 2:56 pm -04:00,I am. I am using the code given in the startercode.    for row_index in range(len(board)):        if word in make_str_from_row(board row_index):            return True    return False, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 3:31 pm -04:00,My first code did not include that. I used it after the first time it got it wrong in the hope that it might change something. Now i have changed it back to this:string =     for i in board[row_index]:        string = string + i    return string, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 3:49 pm -04:00,In my code string is at the same line as the for loop but I have indented it again just to be sure. Thepython and visualizer don’t give an error message but the autograded stillgives an error after I changed the correction you mentioned.Somethings that might give a clue. I have almost the same code for board containsword in column and that one does not give the same error. (one of the reasons Ithink it is my make string for row code that contains the error.    for column_index in range(len(board)):              if word in make_str_from_column(board column_index):                         return Truereturn FalseFurthermoreI also noticed that my board contains word in row function also gives true whenI provide not word but just an empty string( =  ), Unresolved,0

Saturday October 5th 2013 9:23 am -04:00,Could somebody help me with make string from row? I have read several post and it seems to me thatmy code fits the explanations given by Nadine and Tom but for some reason the autograder still gives me errors even though the visualizer and the python shell donot.This is my code:string =     for i in board[row_index]:        string = string + i    return stringI have tested it and it always gives the right answer but when I try touse it within the board contains word in row function I get an error sayingthat the global variable row_index is not defined. I havecreated a temp variableI havecreated a loop for the list elementin thebody I add the selected variable to the temp variableand finallyI print the temp variable giving me a string created out of the selectedvariablesButstill there is something wrong and I cannot figure out what., Resolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 4:45 pm -04:00,@Nadine to make sure Ihave written the code from scratch. But the problem has not disappeared. I hopeit would be what you said and that rewriting would solve it but it did notchange. Now I am guessing whether the problem be somewhere else in the documentand in a function other than the relevant two. Although this might not soundlogical I cannot think of anything else., Resolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 11:10 am -04:00,I’m struggling with this one for a long time. I already have passed themake_str_from_coolumn. I also have passed this function but for some reason itstill contains an error which I cannot find. The function itself works. Itested it I passed it and I got the points for it. But when it try to use thisfunction within the board_contains_word_in_row function I get errors sayingthat the global variable row_index is not defined. I have looked up manyexplanations and my code seems to be fine. It matched all the conditions andalso provides the right outputs when it test it. I’m totally confused andbecause this function has to be reused in other functions I am missing a lot ofpoints while I already have finished the other functions. This is my code:string =     for i in board[row_index]:        string = string + i    return stringI could really use some feedback., Unresolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 11:32 am -04:00,But i have used the function given in the startercode. for row_index in range(len(board)):        if word in make_str_from_row(board row_index):            return True    return False, Unresolved,0

Saturday October 5th 2013 11:59 am -04:00,This is for the first function.

Saturday October 5th 2013 12:26 pm -04:00,I was aware of the wrong example. When trying out functions I try to usedifferent kinds of inputs like a good one wrong one empty one and etc. justto see how the code reacts in different situations. I amnot getting marks for the board_contains_word_in_row function. I get the following error 3 times:NoneMessage:ERROR: NameErrorglobal name row_index is not definedI have used the starter code so I presumed that my first function whichI wrote myself had to be wrong but I did get the points for it and I only getthe error when the auto graded tests the board_contains_word_in_rowfunction. I only get the error in the autograder The code seems to work fine in the python shell and the visualizer., Unresolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 1:39 pm -04:00,Somebody else suggested this code: .join(board[row_index])Ihoped this might provide a solution but it did not help. But I am not familiarwith the .join function so maybe I am doing something wrong. Otherwise I haveto rewrite but I would rather do that as a last option because I have othercourses and I kind of postponed everything to solve this which caused me tofall behind on many things, Unresolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 4:34 pm -04:00,@Adrian I haverewritten the code from scratch and it made no difference. If you haveconfirmed that my code was right and functionally identical to yours could wethen come up with another grading system so that I can have the points I shouldhave gotten with this code? It sounds a bit disappointing to me to have acorrect code but not get the points because of an unknown problem.If notthen I have another suggestion. Would it be possible for me to receive the samecode as mine in another document? That way I can keep the code but work inanother document which is not written by me and might not have the same unknownproblem. I understand this would be breaking the honour code in other case butas you mentioned before my code seems correct and almost identical to yours.  , Unresolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 4:54 pm -04:00,I was wondering the same and checked it but it does not appear somewhere else. I also tested it and passed the function on its own but it keeps giving an error when i try to use it in the contains_word_in_row function., Unresolved,0
