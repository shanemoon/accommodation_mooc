Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:04 pm -04:00,yes this now explains why i also thought the questions were reversed as well.  to be in the function it means you have gone well past that line in the actual code.  thanks!, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 11:05 am -04:00,Thanks Tom this answers my question.  Digit is a variable taking on the individual characters in the string of digits; this makes the answers to the questions make much more sense.I try not to use the code itself to answer these questions because it sorta defeats the purpose...., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:58 am -04:00,Jason your problem is probably that it does not pass the non valid nucleotide test.  for example what happens if you enter get_complement(X)??You should be calling the function is_valid_sequence in your get_sequence function to be sure it passes that test; this is what my code does and it received the max amount of points., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 6:00 pm -04:00,I get this error on my entire code and thus receive no score.  Every function works perfectly in my shell so I would like to know why the grader is giving this error.I used some print statements in my code (NOT to see what is going on but to add some functionality that should be included in the instructions that tells the user whether column or row indices are out of bounds) so is this why?  I plan to re-submit my commenting out the print statements so I will update this thread if that solves the problem.  Thanks., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 6:12 pm -04:00,thanks for the suggestion but no dice.  I didnt import any libraries in my code.., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 8:41 am -04:00,thanks jonathan for all your great help on this class.  but importing wasnt the issue.  my first submission still had no import statements but when i hashed out the print statements that did the trick.  at least this is what it looks like based on my original file submission.  just wanted to clear the air for anyone else. thanks again, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 10:36 am -04:00,Thanks Jonathan!  I must have edited my original file submission and saved the edits on that original file without realizing it.  I appreciate your clarification for me and anyone else who may see this thread.  Now I know not to screw it up on the final!!Keep up the good work.  TAs have been great in this course, Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 4:55 pm -04:00,Just to be clear will we need a good internet conneciton during the ENTIRE 3 hours of the exam or can we start the exam print out the instructions and code for 3 hours then just be sure we have an internet connection before our 3 hours are up?  Some people ahve implied that you submit the final exam bit by bit but my understanding of the instructions are you submit your code all at once in one big (or many several) files and that is it.I would like to do this exam while traveling in a car trip where I know I have internet before I leave and when I arrive and not during the trip.Can a TA perhaps clarify if what I want to do is possible?  Thanks very much., Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:51 pm -04:00,Yeah thats exactly why I am confused.  When they say save your work often so it counts it almost implies you are working through an online terminal that is communicating with the user via an active connection.The instructions however imply you can only submit once so why save often matters at all (unless your computer or Python terminal crashes) seems pretty misleading.Hopefully a TA can clear this up.  Appreciate your input..., Resolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 10:04 am -04:00,Ah I see yes that is very helpful and seems to explain all the conflicting info.  Thanks!, Resolved,0
