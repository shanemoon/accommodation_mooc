Tuesday September 24th 2013 9:11 pm -04:00,I am with you Maya. Its my very first exposure to any kind of computer programming. I really enjoy the lectures but am struggling through the exercises and assignments. On the bright side while I may not ever become a programmer I feel I am at least exposed to the topic and am getting a basic understanding of it. Even just that outcome has made it worthwhile. In retrospect I probably should have purchased the book...,None,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 9:03 pm -04:00,Im trying to run this code against the In Flanders Fields poem to see what it looks like. First I run the code with one of the missing code fragments in this question. Second I create the variable flanders_file = open(In Flanders Fields.txt r). [by the way the Flanders Fields.txt file is saved in my Python folder].Third I run a query lines_startswith(flanders_file T) and get an error:Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#58> line 1 in <module>    lines_startswith(flanders_file T)NameError: name flanders_file is not definedI have a feeling Im not reading in the .txt file properly but not sure what to do. Im sure its simple but Im not getting it. Thanks for any help., Resolved,3
