Sunday September 15th 2013 7:24 am -04:00,Agree totally about the work aspect. That also is the main reason for me i.e. I am sure I could do my work better being able to program. And by do my work better I mean not spend hours doing repetitive things with computers - which is alot of what my work involves.,None,0

Saturday September 14th 2013 8:45 am -04:00,I myself was rather surprised when my code passed with even though I knew it did this:>>> is_valid_sequence()TrueI just cant bring myself to believe that an empty string is a valid sequence. But whatever....., Resolved,0

Thursday October 3rd 2013 3:41 am -04:00,I had exactly the same error (ValueError: could not convert string to float) as well this morning. After reading your post I also saw that  I had similar output of read_grades(gradefile) without converting to float. I went back to the grades.txt file I created and noticed there was an extra couple of blank lines beneath my data list (i.e. at the end of the data not just the first line). After deleting these from my data file the script worked fine.  , Resolved,2
Thursday October 3rd 2013 3:52 am -04:00,you first have to open the file for reading so before you run the read_grades thing you should type in something like:gradefile = open(a1.txt r)then you can type:read_grades(gradefile), Unresolved,1
