Tuesday September 24th 2013 5:21 pm -04:00,I am going to go insane!I have a for loop running which looks at each word in the words list. That seems to work fine. Then I call my make_str_from_row and compare that to the word. If it finds it it updates a counter +1 then moves onto the next word.It then repeats the whole process using the make_str_from_column.For some reason it is finding all the words in the row but not the column. I checked my code for make_str_from_column and that seems to work fine.Those around me listening to my curses and rants would greatly appreciate me getting any help., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 5:32 pm -04:00,Yes I did that and it seems to work fine. But when I try to reuse it in this function I get an error:if word in make_str_from_column(board column_index):UnboundLocalError: local variable column_index referenced before assignment, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 6:36 pm -04:00,I think my problem might lie in my code for the board_contains_word_in_column function. I will go back and revisit it. I have a feeling that once I fix that everything else will fall into place., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 6:54 pm -04:00,OK. Rewrote my board_contains_word_in_column function and that fixed it. Thank you to all for your advice., Unresolved,0
