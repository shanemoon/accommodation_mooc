Thursday August 29th 2013 12:36 am -04:00,Hello guys. I new to programming and i feel like I am getting along pretty well with this course but i have encountered a bit of a hiccup. While i was testing some code for the assignment i encountered a problem. I took two times in seconds then converted them to hours and later subtracted both times in hours to get my result.  This method seemed to work well at first until i got a result that looked like this0.09999999999999998I was tempted to use the round funtion but that would throw off all of my already correct answers. So basically I dont know what to do next Hence im stuck. :/, Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 1:37 am -04:00,I apologize if i didnt provide you with enough info. But the problem was ( I think ive got it now) my method of solving the problem. I.E 1800 / 3600 - 3600 / 3600 this was sloppy unorganized and unreliable. So i decided to be specific in how i tell the computer to run the command  I.E New method (3600- 1800) / 3600 and it seems to be a solutions. I guess i was a bit lazy on this one. Haha. But thank you ever so much for youre reply., Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 3:05 pm -04:00,I dont understand or know how to manipulate the code so that i can reproduce the expected results from the example. So time_to_utc (+112.0) 11.0 This is the intended result but how do i do this? How do i get the program to add when  i want to subtract and subtract when i want to add. Or how do i get it to depending on the given sign of the number I.E positive or negative get the code to identify this and run the opposite operation.Can someone please offer me some advice I am not entirely sure if i even have the correct approach to this question ., Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 3:20 pm -04:00,Thanks guys i got it! It was a simple case of addition and subtraction blown out of proportion. lol I dont know why but when ever I get a question i try to think of the most complex solutions. Thanks again., Resolved,0
