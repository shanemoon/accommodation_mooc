Thursday August 29th 2013 4:17 pm -04:00,Dear allFirst off thank you for reporting this problem to us. Were so sorry for the inconvenience. Its taken us a while to learn of and respond to all the posts related to this issue across forums from a number of classes.As you know were working with NetEase to host video files in China to improve the speed of access for Chinese users. Were now working with NetEase to resolve these issues. In the meantime weve deployed a fix that allows China-based users to fall back on our Amazon CDN-hosted video files if the NetEase files dont load.Again our sincere thanks for alerting us to the issue and our apologies for the trouble. Were working hard to make sure that our courses are fully accessible from China and from everywhere in the world.Many thanks againEli (Coursera), Resolved,4
