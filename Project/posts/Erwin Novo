Tuesday August 20th 2013 1:48 pm -04:00,I think this course is for beginners and it is intended for those people who are really new to programming.  If you really want something intensive for your brain to exert a lot of effort then you should take Java Programming and there are plenty of tutorials over the internet that II heard of.So please allow beginners like us to enjoy our learning based on our zero level skills in programming.Thanks!!! , Resolved Locked,2
