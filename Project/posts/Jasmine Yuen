Tuesday September 10th 2013 2:22 am -04:00,Hey Nick thanks for your input above.  If the data is inactive for a fraction of a second (i.e. for a fraction of a second the data is not attached to any code) would the garbage collector come and clean it up right away?  Using the examples from the lecture again:The example from the lecture (at video time 02:21)x = 1 --> located at id1y = x + 2 --> located at id2x = 7 --> located at id3Now lets say we added another line (line 4):x = 1 --> located at id1y = x + 2 --> located at id2x = 7 --> located at id3x = 1 --> where is x referring to now?  Does it refer back to id1 because the computer stored 1 at id 1?  Or because 1 at id1 wasnt used in line 3 and isnt attached to any code in lines 1-3 it gets cleaned up by the garbage collector and then in line 4 1 iis given a new memory address?(This is probably a very simplified view of memory addresses and Im not sure this question is relevant for the purposes of this course but Im curious.... =)) , Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 2:40 am -04:00,Does anyone know if theres a Python shell available online anywhere?Ive been using my lunchtime in the office to go though the course material and there have been times I want to test some of the scripts or attempt the assignment.  I dont have and cannot install Python on a work computer and am wondering if theres a Python shell available online somewhere?Thanks!, Unresolved,0
