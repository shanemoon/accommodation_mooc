Tuesday August 27th 2013 1:03 pm -04:00,It is correct though. The question is What value does result refer to? and not what is going to be the output. Ive run it through the visualizer and it shows that result refers to None but n1 is 1 and n2 is 3 (the parameters) inside the function. The last line within the function then basically just adds n1 and n2 and prints it on the screen.print: http://tinyurl.com/kla3v8bYou can see this also with the following:result = sum(1 3)4print (result)NoneThe return statement in comparisonreturn http://tinyurl.com/l3jz344result = sum(1 3)print(result)4I hope this makes any sense. Ive just realized it is not that easy (at least for me) to explain. Took me a while to wrap my mind around it.Rupert, Resolved,4
