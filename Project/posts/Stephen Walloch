Sunday September 29th 2013 1:24 pm -04:00,It was a comment on mine which appeared to be the same issue. Thanks for keeping the forum a place for learning and not snarky put-downs. Anyways I resolved mine just now by removing a call to import tkinter I forgot that I had put that at the beginning of the script. I hope this helps others. Ill leave the issue unresolved for now until Vignesh confirms that his error has been resolved as well.Thanks!, Unresolved,0
