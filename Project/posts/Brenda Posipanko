Sunday September 8th 2013 12:08 pm -04:00,I missed one that the grading program thinks is correct. It tells me to consider what happens with 2 passing grades. However I RAN IT with 2 passing grades and it does NOT return the average. It only returns the first of the 2 passing grades.That would make this choice incorrect yes?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 11:35 am -04:00,Say I wanted to build a list using range and assign it to a variable.Â  How exactly do I do that? I was thinking that I could do something like even_num_list = range([begin] [end] 2) but that doesnt seem to work. Is my syntax wrong or am I just completely off track?, Resolved,0
