Sunday August 18th 2013 10:51 pm -04:00,Um Im really new to computers.I watched the video and went to python.org then quick links for 3.3.2 and pressed the link for the windows x86 one. Then I pressed save as and put it in my downloads folder and it started downloading. After that I ran it and a screen popped up and asked to install for all or just one users and a directory to store the files after that there was a customize screen and then it began to install.The thing is though I dont think it came with the IDE and also whenever I open the python-3.3.2 it just asks me whether I want to change repair or remove it?Could someone help me?, Resolved,1
