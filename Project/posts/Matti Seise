Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:41 pm -04:00,For me it says that automated test fails there (even I get the points).Ive tested this: return (time_1 / 1 / 3600) - (time_2 / 1 / 3600)And its giving me the -0.09999999999999998 instead of -0.1 (Ive also tested it without dividing by one with the very same result).This is really bugging me now. Could the rounding by 1 be the real answer? Although it feels so... ugly.I mean this: return round((time_1 / 1 / 3600) - (time_2 / 1 / 3600) 1)This returns the proper value of -0.1 but again this feels quite stupid as other languages manage this straight away..., Unresolved,0

Wednesday August 28th 2013 1:03 pm -04:00,How ever changing the numbers around wont fix the failing tests. So our problem seems to be same. Tests are failing on hours_difference. The math behind it is not too complex so its hard to understand what I do wrong. Tests which are failing for me are: student: test_hours_difference.TestHoursDifference.test_time_1_much_larger_than_time_2student: test_hours_difference.TestHoursDifference.test_time_1_much_smaller_than_time_2student: test_hours_difference.TestHoursDifference.test_time_1_slightly_larger_than_time_2student: test_hours_difference.TestHoursDifference.test_time_1_slightly_smaller_than_time_2, Unresolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 1:49 pm -04:00,Thank you. :) I got it now. The math was failing me after all... So Mr / Mrs Anonymous there pointed the right answer and deserves a virtual medal. I feel so stupid now. In a good way., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 9:46 am -04:00,So:if len(dna_sequence) == 0:    return TrueIs this the proper way to handle it over the test case? How annoying. I have studies from bioinformatics and empty string is definately not a valid dna sequence..., Resolved,0

Friday September 27th 2013 5:30 pm -04:00,8h for 37/37 3.5h to 33/37. So...4.5h of that time got wasted to the last function as I didnt understood the docstring (and the fact that in python the char is same as string... ), Unresolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 1:09 pm -04:00,Grats! 3.5h here spent on this one and Im stuck at 33/37. Last read_board -function to do and then Im relieved as well! :) Im so waiting for that but its a great way to start weekend! :), Resolved,2
Friday September 27th 2013 3:18 pm -04:00,I bet you encountered the same problem as I did. For those 3.5h I spent like 1.5 to that one.The key is not to set the range of the for loop to len(board) but the length of first board-list-element (aka board[index]). hopefully this helps., Resolved,4
Friday September 27th 2013 3:46 pm -04:00,37/37 8h. Last one took that 4.5h due the really misleading docstring.I just couldnt understand that list of list of strings is same in python than list of list of chars in other languages., Resolved,5
Friday September 27th 2013 5:28 pm -04:00,My p(complexity) is n2n^2  and code lenght is 9 rows. Not sure if that can be optimized from there on that neat read_board. ;), Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 5:45 pm -04:00,p(complexity) means the time that algorithm takes to finish since it has been started. Short answer: n2n^2  It means that it has 2 nested loops. So when n ( we know it better as range) gets higher the time gets squared. , Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 3:13 pm -04:00,As mr/mrs Anonymous above said: You should NOT USE open(word_file r) as its done on the main program.However you can (and perhaps should) use those at the coding and testing part. You just need to comment them out before submitting., Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 3:39 pm -04:00,For me the docstring was really misleading as I wasted hours while trying to figure what the heck Im supposed to do.Here is the clarified one I made:	 (file open for reading) -> list of list of str		This function returns list of list of strings which are split to single characters.Return a board read from open file board_file. The board file will contain *One row of the board per line*.Newlines are not included in the board.	 board1.txt:EFJAJCOWSS	SDGKSRFDFFASRJDUSKLKHEANDNDJWAANSDNCNEOPPMSNFHHEJEJEPQLYNXDL>>> test = read_board(board1.txt)>>> print(test)[[E F J A J C O W S S] [S D G K S R F D F F] [A S R J 	D U S K L K] [H E A N D N D J W A] [A N S D N C N E O P] [P M S N F H H E J E] [J E P Q L Y N X D L]], Unresolved,20
Friday September 27th 2013 5:19 pm -04:00,That is the exact output when I have read the file in and returned it.It seems that you have same problem as I had: you have full strings parsed there instead of lists of separate characters.Fix that and you get rid of the failed tests. Although this is on the testing phase as I have open(filename) and file(close) on my code. It allows me to print to idle but I had to remove them before submitting the code to Coursera., Unresolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 7:23 pm -04:00,Seems right return that and get the 37/37! :), Unresolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 7:37 pm -04:00,Have you removed the open and close file statements? , Unresolved,1
Tuesday October 1st 2013 11:10 am -04:00,It doesnt matter if the characters are on upper- or lower case on these functions (on the given files they just happen to be upper case)On reading_word you need to:create a new listloop the file line by line    append line to the just created list and remove new line character (hint: rtstrip)return created list, Unresolved,2
Friday September 27th 2013 6:22 pm -04:00,I love the Ass.3 part on the path file.Kinda summed my feelings when I was doing the whole thing. , Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 6:19 pm -04:00,Your approach sounds quite painful.Mine is very similar with Nicks: On outer loop I check the lines and on inner loop I split the strings from outer loop to single characters. Then I append single characters to a list in the inner loop which I append to my board list at the outer loop.Finally I return whole thing., Unresolved,1
Saturday September 28th 2013 3:52 am -04:00,Have you stripped the open(board_file) and board_file.close() from your code before submitting?Those are necessary while testing but will give errors when you submit the code. (ye its funny like that as opening and closing the file have been done in a3_driver.py ), Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 3:55 am -04:00,That False is not True also tells that you have something wrong  with your (nested) loops. Double check the ranges you are passing to them., Unresolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 12:45 pm -04:00,This course is in fact really hard.I have masters degree on computer science (software systems) and Ive been working as a software architect about 2 years now and currently I teach programming. I havent ever done python before but still.. Im struggling. I have got full points on all assignments (including this one) but this one took me 8 hours to complete so I guess required skill cap takes a giant leap here on these last 2 exercises. Just dont give up I personally think the problem is on problem setting (on scaffolding to be exact) not on the fact that students are stupid... :P, Unresolved,3

Saturday September 28th 2013 10:33 am -04:00,I made a clearer version of a docstring.https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2724I made it with 2 nested for loops but I know there are other options available as well. :), Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 12:38 pm -04:00,Here is pseudocode about how I did it.Create a  first new list   At Outer loop: loop the input file        While looping: create a second new list             Go to inner loop where loop through the letters                  append them to second list            append second list to first listreturn first listHopefully this helps this exercise is pain.... :P, Resolved,0
