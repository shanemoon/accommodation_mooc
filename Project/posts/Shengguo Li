Tuesday September 17th 2013 10:26 pm -04:00,I have putted into the visualizer and looked at each step but still I dont understand how the execution picked up the parameters from the first print command for calculation and then ignored the first print command and rather had the None printed before second print command for the final values., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 11:24 am -04:00,I had similar code like the one posted above and later I modified like thiswords_counter = 0    for word in range(len(words)):        if board_contains_word(board word):            words_counter = words_counter + 1    return words_counterIf run this code it returns an error : if board_contains_word(board word):NameError: global name word is not definedI thought the error was because word in the earlier module board_contains_word (board word) is a string word. Here in this module it is a list so I modified it to words[i].words_counter = 0    for word in range(len(words)):        if board_contains_word(board word[i]):            words_counter = words_counter + 1    return words_counter It seems reasonable to me because this time it is really comparing the word in a list but  after running the code it gives a wrong answer the example returns 5 rather than 3.Any idea what is wrong in my case?Thanks., Resolved,0
