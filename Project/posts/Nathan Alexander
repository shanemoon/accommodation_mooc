Thursday September 5th 2013 10:08 pm -04:00,HelloI apologize in advance if this has been discussed already but I was wondering if any of you know of any good Python books/tutorials out there? I have looked at Pragmatic Practical Programming some which seems fairly good but am wondering if there any *good* books that have you writing code yourself? Maybe at the level of where we would be at when this course ends? Thanks so much in advance this course has been great so far just to dig a bit deeper! Nathan,None,0
