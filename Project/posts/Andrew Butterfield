If the return is inside the if statement then once it goes through the if statement once it will hit return and exit out of the code. The indentation is almost always my problem when I am trying to do these assignments. , Unresolved,2

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:04 pm -04:00,Mark -I just got my make_str_from_row to work and your really close. All you need to do is add an index to the end of the list on your for loop. list[row_index]:Im still trying to get my make_str_from_column to work if anyone has any explanations about that. , Unresolved,0
