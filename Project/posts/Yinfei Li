Thursday August 22nd 2013 4:17 pm -04:00,Hello thereI am a newb in Python. I found there are two IDLE programs. When I run the one with Python Shell dialog box I cannot get the correct result. For example when I run the code such as 9/2 I always get 4 instead of 4.5. But if I run the one with Python 3.3.2 Shell there is no problem. Any ideas? Why are there two program? And why one of them doesnt show the right result? I am a little confused.Â Thanks in advance!,None,0
