Friday August 23rd 2013 3:56 pm -04:00,Hi MaryI also spent a long time trying to wrap myhead around the modulo and negative numbers specifically the idea that themodulo always takes the sign of the divisor (denominator).   I finally figured it out by think about itin the inverse.First the integer division:-17 / 10 is -1.7 which is between -1 and -2. In integer division Python always returns the floor (lowest) so -17//10 would return -2.The modulo is the remainder so -2 * 10 is -20  – 20 + 3 is -17 so -17%10 would return 3 (positive) If the signs were reversed 17/-10 the divisionwould be the same17//-10 returns -2The modulo changes however:-2 * -10 is +2020 – 3 is 17 so the modulo would be -3 ratherthan +3.Hope that helps.   Judi , Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 2:25 pm -04:00,What is the role of function in the code used in the example?  In other words what is the difference between the following?1.  def convert_to_minutes(num_hours):     (int) -> int    Return the number of minutes there are in num_hours hours.    >>> convert_to_minutes (2)    120        result = num_hours * 60    return resultand 2. def convert_to_minutes(num_hours):     (int) -> int    Return the number of minutes there are in num_hours hours.    >>> convert_to_minutes (2)    120        return num_hours * 60When I step through the Visualizer they do the same thing (theres just the added step).   , Resolved,1

Sunday September 1st 2013 5:19 pm -04:00,Is there a standard way to represent floats in our examples.    I was working on Question 3 in the textbook:  Following the function design recipe define a function that . . .  returns that number tripled.One of my examples was triple (0.4) which I expected to return 1.2 but actually returned 1.2000000000000002.  Do I change my example to be 1.2000000000000002 or do I just leave it?  I could just use another example but Im curious as to whether theres a standard for this. Thanks, Unresolved,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 1:50 pm -04:00,IvaylaIm not sure if you solved this yet.  If youre running your code through the visualizer  you need to assign values grade1 and grade2.  I used your code and got the same message but when I added grade1 = 50 and grade2 = 60 it worked.   , Resolved,1
Monday September 9th 2013 9:35 pm -04:00,I tried to create a function that would return the vowels in Happy Anniversary but each on separate lines.   In the shell it worked using this:>>> for char in (Happy Anniversary):          if char in AEIOUaeiou:                print (char)a    AieaHowever when I tried to create a function and run it it wouldnt work.  def collect_vowelsnew(s):     (str) -> str    Return the vowels from s one per line.  Do not consider y a vowel.    >>> collect_vowelsnew(Happy Anniversary)        a        A        i        e        a    >>> collect_vowelsnew(Happy New Year)        a        e        e        a             for char in s:            if char in aeiouAEIOU:                print (char)It returned only a What am I doing wrong?  , Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:54 am -04:00,I agree that tracing my code by hand would help cement what I am doing.  That said I am a newbie to coding and in many cases would have difficulty doing this.  We havent seen many examples of it.   It would be helpful to see more examples of how to do this.  Does anyone have examples they could share or a site they could direct me to?  , Unresolved,1
Thursday September 12th 2013 8:45 am -04:00,Could someone confirm that for this assignment it is our highest mark that will count rather than the last?   I ask because  in the first assignment the last submission was the one that counted.   For this one  I submitted as I went along but I can only see my last submission.   I have now completed the assignment and got 24.  Now I want to experiment with different ways of doing it  but dont want to overwrite my current mark.  I also dont want to lose the feedback for my best one.   , Resolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 2:33 pm -04:00,This is actually a question about the book but seems to correspond with this part of the lectures.   Im a bit confused by question 3 in chapter 8.  Ill write it out for those who dont have the book. Variable appointments refers to the list [9:00 10:30 14:00 15:00 15:30].  An appointment is scheduled for 16:30 so 16:30 needs to be added to the list. 1) add it using append2) add it using the + operator3) which modified the list and which didnt.the answers given are: 3. a. appointments.append(16:30)   b. appointments += [16:30]   c. The approach in (a) modifies the list.  The one in (b) creates a new list.I understand  that + operator creates a new list and that append adds the element to the existing list.    So if I create a list:revised_appointments = appointments + [16:30] I  have 2 lists that are not connected.If I use append:revised_appointments = appointments.append[16:30] I create an alias and both are pointing to the same memory object. However if I use the code above appointments += [16:30]  it seems to me that I am modifying the original list.  I ran it through the visualizer  and it seems to confirm my thought.  Am I missing some subtlety?, Unresolved,2

Thursday October 3rd 2013 10:42 am -04:00,Thanks AlanYour explanation is very clear but I think you might be giving me a bit too much credit.   I think  the book was wrong but not as wrong as I originally thought (LOL).   I had interpreted the question about which modified the list and which didnt to mean in which case would you still have access to the original list.  Now my followup question is:    If I used the normal syntax and there are now two memory addresses would I be able to access the original object (at the original memory address) given that the variable name has been reassigned to the new memory address?   , Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 12:43 pm -04:00,This is good timing as I didnt really know where to post this.   As preparation for the exam I decide to create a little mastermind game.  My reason for choosing this particular activity was because my biggest challenge to date has been figuring out the indentation (what belongs with what) in nested loops.  I had to look up how to generate a random 4 digit number but everything else I learned in this course.  It was really helpful in trying to wrap my head around the concepts (but as I have not written the exam yet I dont know how helpful it was as a preparation tool).  I had to use a lot of the tools we covered in the course and I definitely feel more prepared so  it might be a good activity for you.Ive attached the code and any suggestions or comments would be appreciated.   The code for generating the code number is at the top.   I have never uploaded code so I assume you can just save it as a py file and run it.  Theres a commented out line before the while statement that prints the code number that I used for testing.  http://paste.debian.net/50420/Im also including a link to some of the other posts that list practice resources. https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=639 Theres also a practice section on the course wiki - https://share.coursera.org/wiki/index.php/LTP:PracticeGood Luck!!!,None,1
Friday October 4th 2013 10:17 pm -04:00,Thanks MoidI like the option  of choosing how many numbers.  It looks great.  I wish there was more opportunity in the course for this sort of collaboration.  Im going to try to write the exam tomorrow and then may play around with this again - or come up with a new project.See you in the next course - if not before. ,None,0
