Sunday September 1st 2013 3:51 am -04:00,I get that adding a negative number is the same as subtracting but my problem is that one of the examples is 0.0 with an UTC offset of -1. If I subtract 1 from the 0.0 I dont get 23 (which I want with clock arithmetic) I get -1.It seems that the program needs a special way to handle offset times that go over the 24 hour mark or go under it.Am I just thinking about this incorrectly?, Unresolved,0
