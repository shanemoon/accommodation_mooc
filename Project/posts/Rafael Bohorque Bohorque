Sunday September 29th 2013 7:48 am -04:00,Mark I substituted in my code and it is working pretty good I tested with some of my examples and no complains I have to say I was getting the same failure message until I moved to the piece of code where you have to write the board_contains_word_in_column(board word):code and after I submitted everything was correct. Try next code specially that one that is pretty easy and tell me if that worked for you. Cheers pal, Unresolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 1:32 pm -04:00,Your problem probably is in the functionboard_contains_word_in_columnYou might want to check the range of the column if you typed for column_index in range(len(board))that will only evaluate the length of the board of the rows which is 2 so go and check that part it should be 3 as the length of the column is 4 range(0 4) will evaluate 0 1  2 3 positions. Hope it helps , Unresolved,0
