Tuesday August 27th 2013 1:23 pm -04:00,Im not really seeing the difference between Question 5 and 6.  Why is the answer in question 5 return country whereas in question 6 it is print country then return country?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 4:32 pm -04:00,Im really stuck on the get minutes function.   This is what I have:### Write your get_hours function definition here:def get_hours(seconds):     (int) -> int    >>> get_hours(3600)    1    >>> get_hours(7200)    2    return to_24_hour_clock((seconds//3600))### Write your get_minutes function definition here:def get_minutes(seconds):     (int) -> int    >>> get_minutes(3800)    3    >>> get_minutes(7200)    120    return to_24_hour_clock((seconds//60)%60)### Write your get_seconds function definition here:def get_seconds(seconds):     (int) -> int    >>> get_seconds (213)    33    >>> get_seconds (180)    0    return seconds % 60, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 4:44 pm -04:00,Actually I figured it out but would be really helpful if someone explained it in words to me for reinforcement:def get_minutes(seconds):     (int) -> int    >>> get_minutes(3800)    3    >>> get_minutes(7200)    120        return (seconds//60)%60, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 12:45 pm -04:00,All the accumulator examples were done with vowels I dont know what to set the range of i (conditions on i) to or how to deal with the variables--- should there be one or two ss?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 1:06 pm -04:00,What is the sum of the odd numbers from 1523 through 10503 inclusive? Hint: write a while loop to accumulate the sum and print it. Then copy and paste that sum. For maximum learning do it with a for loop as well using range., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 2:09 pm -04:00,Thanks.  I did the sum of that range which gives you the answer but the answer asked for a while or for loop.... i could do this problem without resorting to either..... which is part of my confusion. I could just type the answer in here it seems and it would be graded correctly, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 2:53 pm -04:00,I just literally wrote the range as above and put a sum() around that.  Although this was the right answer Id still like to know how to set up the for/while loop correctly...., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 2:57 pm -04:00,Oh so a range is a for loop...whoops forgot that, Unresolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 10:24 am -04:00,Im confused as to whether the for is needed here and if so how it would be structured?, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 11:50 am -04:00,I dont know where to start..... I think I can write the code needed here but need to be taken through the initial steps...beggining with how to get the file provided into IDLE, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 7:01 pm -04:00,Thanks Denis.  once I have it opened in idle I ran the module and got an error.  What else do I need to do before writing the while loop in the a3 window?  I watched the lecture and couldnt follow what he was doing prior to writing the while/for loop.Thanks, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 7:30 pm -04:00,Im referring to the read_words function (I made the title of this post readline I meant readwords...oops!).  I understand the concept but literally how do I start that and get the file read in python?  in the shell or in the a3 file? do I just have to write the loop in the a3 file? is there no step prior to that? Thanks., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 9:07 am -04:00,For assignment 3 (and in general) will it be possible to have the answers posted with explanation after the due date?, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 9:38 am -04:00,Thank you.  Will that apply to all assignments/hw?BestFareez, Resolved,0
