Wednesday September 25th 2013 11:37 am -04:00,HiÂ I would like to get a breakdown of the points given for each function. I think this would be useful for all. In this way we know if what we submitted is correct. For example I submitted the code for the first function and received 2/37. This however does not tell me that I received full credit.Thanks for your help., Unresolved,0
