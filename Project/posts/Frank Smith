Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:21 pm -04:00,The error is pointing to the section of code that is the problem. Look at the spacing and syntax of the line. From what you have posted it is looking at line 139 space 5 the normal indent should be 4 try removing the extra space., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:28 pm -04:00,To make sure you have the correct spacing if you got an extra space use delete until it the line in question goes to the line above. Careful not to delete anything from the line above and then hit the enter key. This will in most cases keep the correct indentation format for the function you are writing.Â You look like you are at the end of the code so starting over might be a bit extreme.Hope this helps., Resolved,0
