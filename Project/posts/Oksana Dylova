Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:25 am -04:00,I understood almost all from the video except for the part of comparing two strings for their dictionary order.I understand that:>>> A < BTruebecause in ASCII table A is on 65th positions and B stands on 66th position.But how is happening the comparison when there are more letters in the string?:>>> abracadabra < aceTruea is on 97th position b - 98th c - 99th r - 114th: abracadabra < ace           a = a           b < c - this one matters if Im correct           r > ePlease say something - am I understanding it right or wrong? If not - please explain me. Thanks :), Resolved,2

Tuesday September 17th 2013 8:25 am -04:00,But in the program we dont have s[0:i]: while i < len(s) and not (s[i] in aeiouAEIOU):        before_vowel = before_vowel + s[i]        i = i + 1we have only s[i] - how could it be a slice?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 9:37 am -04:00,Ok lets say we dont have a condition about stopping accumulating characters until the vowel appears:    # before_vowel contains all the characters found in s[0:i].    before_vowel =     i = 0    # Accumulate the non-vowels at the beginning of the string.    while i < len(s):        before_vowel = before_vowel + s[i]        i = i + 1    return before_vowel Z Y M U G R Y0 1 2 3 4 5 6First loop execution:we have an empty before_vowel string and i = 0 :our current s[i] = s[0] = z -> before_vowel =  + zSecond loop:we have z before_vowel string and i = 1: our current s[i] = s[1] = y -> before_vowel = z + yThird loop:we have zy before_vowel string and i = 2: our current s[i] = s[2] = m -> before_vowel = zy + mFourth loop:we have zym before_vowel string and i = 3: our current s[i] = s[3] = u -> before_vowel = zym + uFifth loop:we have zymu before_vowel string and i = 4: our current s[i] = s[4] = g -> before_vowel = zymu + gSixth loop:we have zymug before_vowel string and i = 5: our current s[i] = s[5] = r -> before_vowel = zymug + rSeventh loop:we have zymugr before_vowel string and i = 6: our current s[i] = s[6] = y -> before_vowel = zymugr + ylen(s) -> 7; i = 7which is greater then len(s) -> we get False in the condition -> loop exits and we get zymugrySo does that mean that because our i was encountered anyway by 1 and became 7 we say that - before_vowel contains all the characters found in s[0:i] meaning in our case s[0:7]?, Unresolved,2
Friday September 20th 2013 6:15 am -04:00,So in the question we see:  You know that type list is mutable and str int float and bool are immutable. Based on this what should we expect to happen when the following code is executed?   def interrupted(s):    s[-1] = - greeting = how are you interrupted(greeting) print(greeting)And are given answers to choose from:how are yo- is printedhow are you is printedPython raises an errorI chose the second option because the last line of code says print(greeting) and of course as we know str are immutable so our greeting string didnt change; though it turned up the right answer was the last option. So I suggest:1. either to remove the last line of code:print(greeting)2. or to specify the question3. or to give the options the ability of checkboxes so we could choose both options - thats the most logic solution as I see.Thanks :), Resolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 9:06 am -04:00,Do really I need to test in visualizer?? of course I tested code in IDLE before choosing the answer and here is the screenshot of my test:as you can see I created the functionthen in the Shell I created a variable greeting for string how are youI executed the function interrupted(greeting) and got the ErrorI executed the print(greeting) function and got how are you because string didnt changeWhat I didnt understand right - was the question in the quiz: what should we expect to happen when the following code is executed? - as you can see they just ask about the following code they didnt ask - what will happen when the function interrupted(greeting) will be executed? or what will happen when the function the print(greeting) will be executed? Thats why I was confused and didnt know what answer to choose - thats it.Anyway thanks for helping me :), Resolved,0
