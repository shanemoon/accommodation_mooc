Sunday September 15th 2013 7:36 pm -04:00,I am almost there!  For the test: count_nucleotides(ATCGGC G) and using the string.count(substring) - I am getting 1 instead of 2.  Any hints???  Is it my assignment statement?, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 8:14 pm -04:00,It doesnt look like I need a [start end] since Python will start at index 0 and count all occurrences?? Here is what I used num_occurrences = dna.count(ATCG)return num_occurrencesIts only counting each occurrence one time, Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 17th 2013 9:40 pm -04:00,HelloI referred to this post for help - and took the advice to switch out the shift_one and call get_complement.  My results are constantly an empty .  Without posting my code which is broken - can you help?output =                            # Initialize the accumulator variable.    for char in message:                  # For every character in message...        output = output + shift_one(char)     # ...add the shifted char to output.    return output                         # When every char was added return the result., Resolved,0
