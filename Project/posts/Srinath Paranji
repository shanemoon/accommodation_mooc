Wednesday September 18th 2013 10:34 pm -04:00,HiI got the following error for the is_valid_sequence part of the code. My code works fine and I have tested for all the scenarios and I get the appropriate T/F answers. But autograder still gives me the following error and I dont get marks for this question.Whats the issue here? I am totally confused.
