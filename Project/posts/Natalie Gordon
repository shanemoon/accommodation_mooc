Thursday August 29th 2013 4:12 pm -04:00,This is the second example of a completely undefined question we are somehow supposed to read the mind of the questioner to understand. There is absolutely no indication in this question of what is being asked nor the format of the answer required. I was only able to answer this question because of the explanation but I fail to see what part of the video up to this point demonstrated what the question meant much less what the format required for the correct answer would be. I suggest adding something like Using the steps of design what is the next entry? or something like that. There is no question to answer in this question., Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 4:23 pm -04:00,BTW once I understood what the question was and what the format for the answer should be I got it immediately. It must be an integer because you cant count vowels and get a number that is not an integer as an answer., Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 4:46 pm -04:00,Based on the answer Etienne gave me on another threat I am going to post exactly what I am seeing:The function count_vowels returns the number of vowels in a given word (a str). For example:>>>count_vowels(moose)3>>>count_vowels(scratch)1[empty space to put in answer], Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 4:59 pm -04:00,Thanks to Etienne I have figured out there is an issue with using Safari. The formatting drops part of the question. I have switched to Firefox and the issue is resolved but anyone using Safari would be advised to switch to a differnet browser., Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 2:25 pm -04:00,Can someone please explain to me what exactly am I supposed to be considering. What exactly does consider define to? I entered x id3y id2 and thats wrong. I did get this messageNote that the question just asks for a value so dont include any other information other than the value.I dont see where the question asked for any value. Apparently I am not permitted to find out the correct value either. I am only told that the statement consider = a question which asks for a value.Hopelessly confused here., Resolved,1
Thursday August 29th 2013 2:40 pm -04:00,Are you saying the term consider this code has a specific meaning when discussing python and that specific meaning is defined as detailing how many parameters the function definition have?Further this term consider this code will be applicable to all future instances when I see the term as How many parameters does the -insert name of function- definition have?If so the answer appears to be the parameters of the function add() are num1 and num2. But why not just ask for parameters then instead of making an ambiguous statement like consider this code?Would not simply asking for parameters of the function be clearer and easier to understand?Also I do not see a defined function() with this quizz question. , Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 4:38 pm -04:00,Ah ha! That is the issue. In the video I do not see  After the code above is executed what value does y refer to?All I see is this:Consider this codex = -10y=abs(x)x=11(Reminder: built-in value abs returns the absolute value of the the number)Thats all I see. (chuckling -  no wonder it made no sense at all)Question how do we fix this?, Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 4:56 pm -04:00,I have changed browsers from Safari to Firefox and the issue is resolved. I can now see the entire question. Will file that bug reprot anyway. Switching back and forth between flash and html did not fix it in Safari, Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 5:01 pm -04:00,Problem resolved sort of. Need a general warning to any person using Safari., Resolved,0
