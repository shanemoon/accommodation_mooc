Wednesday August 21st 2013 8:52 am -04:00,Hi there.I am just wondering if the Python interpreter can work with the screen reader Voiceover on a Mac because as I learn this course I am teaching it to my visually impaired best friend and she wants to be able to write code on her Macbook Air and hear it read by Voiceover rather than dictating it to me to type.Thanks in advance for your help ;), Unresolved,0
