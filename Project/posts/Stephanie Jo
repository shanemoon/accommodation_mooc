Wednesday September 25th 2013 8:08 pm -04:00,HelloAt my workplace we spend a lot of time copy-pasting or handwriting the same information ins different formats.  I would really like to come up with some Word compatible program to have this automated.  Anybody familiar with coming up with a program that asks with user input and then generate several different forms?  Thanks.,None,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 6:44 pm -04:00,Basically patient data lab values imaging studies etc; so mostly text data (alphanumeric).For example for one format I need to put medication list first then allergies in rows next to each other.Another format I need to put allergies next to patient names and medication list is 3-4 columns away.Copy pasting this manually or writing them out multiple times is error prone and time consuming so I want a program where it stores information by user input intact and then generate different formats.,None,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 6:50 pm -04:00,I heard of some way of writing short programs that can make existing program do something for you.  Is this possible with Word or notepad/wordpad (does not necessarily need to use Python)?  Ideally the program will be something like:Open -> make new file -> program asks for user to enter patient name -> program asks for user to  nter patient medical record number -> enter age -> etc -> save then Options to generate format 1 2 3 etc,None,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 9:48 pm -04:00,Thanks for the input.  It seems that macros is the way to go.  Commercial programs obviously doesnt work because admin doesnt want to spend the money.  I just want something to make life easier for myself and fellow residents since half our stuff never make it to medical records but we need to keep generating them anyways.  ,None,0
