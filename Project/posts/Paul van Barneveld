Tuesday September 3rd 2013 9:31 pm -04:00,The question asked: Variable instructors refers to the value 2. Select the expression(s) that produce True.One of the expressions uses the or operator. One part is false but the other part is true which means the expression should return True.However I have been marked as incorrect for selecting this as one of of the expressions that produce True.What have I missed? Why am I being marked incorrect for this answer?, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:04 pm -04:00,The expression was: instructors < 2 or instructors > 4Since instructors refers to the value 2 I thought this expression would return True. Am I wrong?, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 12:36 am -04:00,Yeah sorry my bad. It was actually the instructors > 4 that I was reading wrong. I read it as instructors less than 4 instead of instructors greater than 4.Typing it into IDLE didnt help as when I typed it I typed it as >>>instructors < 2 or instructors < 4Should have used copy & paste like I did in my post above. Amatuer mistake!, Resolved,1
