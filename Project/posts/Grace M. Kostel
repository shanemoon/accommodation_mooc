Saturday August 24th 2013 12:41 pm -04:00,Thus far I have had no problems with using Python on my computer. But during the lecture for Function Calls as I attempted to practice the lecture material I was unable to follow along. When I attempt to define f(x) using def f(x) as instructed I receive a Syntax Error.I have copied the message I receive below. Any help with this will be most appreciated!..................................................................................................Python 3.3.1 (v3.3.1:d9893d13c628 Apr 6 2013 20:25:12) [MSC v.1600 32 bit (Intel)] on win32Type copyright credits or license() for more information>>> def f(x):            return x ** 2f(3)SyntaxError: invalid syntax>>>>>> def area(base height):             return base * height / 2area(1520)SyntaxError: invalid syntax>>> area(1520)Traceback (most recent call last):   File       area(1520)NameError: name area is not defined>>>,None,0
Saturday August 24th 2013 2:58 pm -04:00,MichaelDid you mean the space key ...press key twice... as you wrote in your message above? And yes I did indent the second line after the def. I wrote it as follows:def area(base height):     return base * height/2but receive the message SyntaxError: invalid syntax when I make the call area(1520)Another thing I just tried was to call help by usinghelp(def)and also triedhelp(define)but still receive the same message that is SyntaxError: invalid syntax.,None,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 2:53 pm -04:00,Thank you all for your help! The error I received was due to the fact that I did not hit enter often enough to return to the >>> before I called the function.,None,0

Then on Line 3 you reassigned to the variable x the value of y making x the same value as y which is the value 5.,None,0
