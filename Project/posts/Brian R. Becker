Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:40 am -04:00,An accumulator is a variable which is used to build up a final answer out of the pieces of the input. For example in length = 0for char in string:    length = length + 1the variable length is an accumulator which will contain the length of the string at the end of the loop. Each character processed by the loop adds (or accumulates) its portion (1) to the final answer.Accumulators can be numbers or strings or in this case Booleans., Unresolved,0

The return statement in your program is aligned with the if above and is therefore inside the for loop. This means that your program is really only looking at the first character in s before returning. If you shift the return statement so its lined up with the for it should work., Unresolved,2

This means that in your code only the first letter of the string will ever be examined. Try hello as an input and you will see that it incorrectly returns False.First you want to have a single return statement outside of the for loop (so lined up with the for statement). Remove the returns under the ifs.Next the way that the function is designed it assumes that there is no vowel (see the vowel_found = False before the for loop) until it finds a vowel (at which point we want to set vowel_found to True). Once we find a vowel we dont ever want to forget that fact so we should never set vowel_found back to False.At the end of the for loop if we found a vowel vowel_found should be True. If we didnt find a vowel vowel_found should still be False (from the initializer before the loop). Either way once the loop is over we have our answer so we return it.Does this help?, Unresolved,2
