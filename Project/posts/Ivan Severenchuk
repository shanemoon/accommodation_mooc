Sunday September 1st 2013 6:15 am -04:00,Hey AngelI totally feel your frustration cause Im in the same situation.  Last night I almost gave in but taking a nap did magic :)  I think if we have a goal to succeed in our intentions to learn how to program a bit of patience and perseverance would help us.  Even though we might not get the highest marks in this course we will still end up a step closer to our desired outcome.  Stay put and good luck!,None,1
