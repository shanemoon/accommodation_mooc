Sunday September 1st 2013 11:21 pm -04:00,yeah. Im totally confused on the grading. I got 41/41 on the main assignments page. But when I look at my feedback it looks like I got 42 in some rows and 41 with something wrong in others. I got a failure:student: test_get_hours.TestGetHours.test_large_inputI cant tell if that is the error Jen and Paul talked about therefore no defect in my submission or if it is my error.Any ideas?, Unresolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 10:32 pm -04:00,I visualize (seconds) like a lump of clay and I am going to cut it into three parts. I think of hh:mm:sec as the three parts.The left part is the biggest. It represents the hours. It is a whole multiple of 3600. It doesnt matter if I call it 2 hours or 7200 seconds it is still the same size lump of clay. What operand will cut off a whole number of hours and discard the remainder?Moosh all the clay back together.The minutes is a smaller lump of clay. Now I want to get rid of the hours - same size as before -  but keep what is left. What operand will let you keep the remainder? Then I want to do what I did above cut off the whole number of minutes just like I cut off the whole number of hours above. I want a whole multiple of 60 this time.Moosh all the clay back together. Now to get the smallest lump of clay the seconds just cut out the hours - whole multiples of 3600 - and keep the remainder. On the same line next cut out the minutes - whole multiples of 60 - and keep the remainder. Since its already in seconds you are done., Resolved,2

Wednesday September 4th 2013 9:11 pm -04:00,Tom you created the test scores of 50 10 and 20. That is not part of the problem. The questions is agnostic with respect to test values., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 9:07 pm -04:00,I am with you Ziming all three would result in a True. The only way to make OR operations False is for all three to fail and that is not one of the three given options. See the bottom matrix in this graphic., Unresolved,3
Wednesday September 4th 2013 9:22 pm -04:00,I went back to the question. It ask which expression is true exactly when the expression is bool type True.Its a tricky question. Passed all tests is not true exactly because it exceeds the requirements of the Boolean expression. Passed some but not all is close but it is actually more restrictive than the Boolean expression in that it excludes passed all.You are not trying to figure out which will give a True. You are trying to evaluate the logic behind the Boolean expression itself.Think of it as what is the BEST answer? Everybody hates those questions :), Unresolved,3
Sunday September 22nd 2013 9:57 am -04:00,Im still at a loss.I read the FAQs. I am having the same problem:Why does the autograder says All=8; Errors=8; Failures=0; Successes=0; Warnings=0? My code was working before!           The reason for that is probably that the last time you modified your code you introduced a Syntax Error somewhere in the file.    When that happens the autograder cannot use the file at all and therefore all the tests are showing as failure.    Try and run your file as a module in IDLE if there is a SyntaxError somewhere it wont run and IDLE should highlight the source of the problem.My code worked fine for Step 1. When I submitted Step 2 all of it was wrong including the earlier work. Taking the first error as an example:Method Description:Have you tested with zero-length sequences?Message:ERROR: AttributeErrorReplacerModule object has no attribute is_longerI tested with zero-length sequences. It works fine. I reran the code (F5). No syntax error - obviously since the code returns correct answers in IDLE.Etienne suggested Try and run your file as a module in IDLE. So I tried:>>> import a2>>> is_longer( )False>>> a2.is_longer( )False>>> a2.is_longer(ATCG )True>>> a2.is_longer( ATCG)FalseThese are correct answers but autograder says they are not.Help!, Resolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 12:11 pm -04:00,Re: is there a difference between importing it and running it?I think Etiennes point was that importing it would force another validation of syntax.I should have restarted the shell to clear it out then import it as a module. I didnt think to do that., Resolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 10:38 am -04:00,Good suggestion. I am trying it now...In hindsight when I submitted last time I used the additional submission button instead of the code submission button since it was my second submission. It did return Your submission has been accepted and will be graded shortly.This time I used code submission.The results are back ... aaaaand one of these two changes fixed it. Thanks a million!, Resolved,0
