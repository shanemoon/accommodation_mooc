Thursday September 26th 2013 6:00 am -04:00,I submitted the assignment and got all SUCCESS so I suppose no errors are there in my codes. But once I run the game when just after finish entering the player names I got :IndexError: list index out of rangeIt says its in the make_str_from_column function.But since the auto grader gave me all SUCCESS with no other feedback I have no clue about what is the exact error in my code or elsewhere.Its funny that I saw posts saying they could run the game regardless of some errors in their codes while I am being the opposite. Does anyone have the same problem as mine?, Resolved,3
Thursday September 26th 2013 10:55 am -04:00,ok this problem got fixed.Its indeed about the make_str_from_column(board column_index) function.  My original code was for variable in board and thus the IndexError popped out.  After I made it into for variable in range sort the whole game runs. And this version is also 37/37.Well I still kinda wonder that how could the autograder successfully pass the test of my original code if it failed in running at all., Resolved,0
