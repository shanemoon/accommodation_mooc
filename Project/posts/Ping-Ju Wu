Wednesday August 28th 2013 2:09 am -04:00,Hello Im Ping from Taiwan. The opinions below are just my own view so if you have any comment or opinion please feel free to discuss with me or correct me. Many thanks.I think the first point is what is the final type we want.Some functions result will return string some will return int etc. If I want to get string at final I will put the function outside of it.The second point is we have to know what we want to get at final just like Professor mention at the assignment ones preface you have to understand the problem domain., Unresolved,0
