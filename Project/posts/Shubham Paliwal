Saturday August 31st 2013 6:49 am -04:00,Rightly said Jim. In the entire assignment I wrote only the return statement in the function body (excluding the def of a function and the description) for solving the problems. :) It has only to do with the use of right operator. Also I needed help in running the a1_gui.py. Whenever I run it it says : ImportError: No module named tkinterBut when I look in the directory there is a file named tkinter in one of the folders. Any guesses what the error could be?, Pinned Resolved,0
