Monday September 9th 2013 10:55 pm -04:00,HelloI have been thinking about this for a week now and Im stumped What is the programmatic structure for creating a variable that contains multiple other variables? Or perhaps I should say a variable that references multiple other variables. For example if I want to make a game with the player controller character (lets call him Hero Dude) having the following variables:Name: Hero Dude  Speed: two tiles per second Hitpoints: 10Attack: 6Armor: 2 Speed hitpoints attack and armor are all sub-objects of Hero Dude. I need to know the programmatic structure for having one variable (Hero Dude) that contains all these other variables.  I am new to programing so I may not be using the correct terminology. I do understand what a loop (for or while) is IF then structure i.e the general structures in programming. You may wonder why I am calling these variables. Hitpoints cant be a constant because I plan to have items that will add to them so for example at level 2 Hero Dude may get + 2 hitpoints meaning that hitpoints needs to be able to change to 12 instead of being frozen at 10. The same for the other mentioned variables. The way I have seen this done in other games varies. For example in age of empires 3 stats (i.e. health movement attack etc) are placed inside an xml file on a per unit basis.  The format being<attack>6</attack><health>10</health> etc. At that point it must be that the game engine knows what <health>  <attack> and the other values are and how to handle them. i.e. when a unit is attacked the formula is unit receiving the attack takes attack damage of attacker unit minus unit receiving attacks armor value. However I dont know what type of programing stuctures are on the back end to make the game understand hey everything in /entities/hero dude.xml refers to the abilities hero dude has. Any examples (with or without code) would help a lot! Thank you kindly in advance for your assistance. ,None,1
Thursday September 12th 2013 6:09 am -04:00,Thank everyone!A stronger villian? Hmm well from the above code example ie.:# define character classclass Character:    def __init__(self speed hitpoints attack armor):        self.speed = speed        self.hitpoints = hitpoints        self.attack = attack        self.armor = armor    def get_speed(self):        return self.speed    def get_hitpoints(self):        return self.hitpoints    def get_armor(self):        return self.armor    def add_hitpoints(self points):        self.hitpoints += pointsInstead of   hero_dude = Character(2 10 6 2)               I could go with villian = Character(4 12 7 4)  and call the same class replacing every instance of Hero_dude with villian. However I wonder what happens if villian and hero_dude both call the same class at the same time? How is that threading handled? Does villian need his own class?  I also considered adding a gaia class with no attack or armor for non player controlled animals that wander around i.e. deer chickens.        For items I can create functions that do what the item should. For example sword of double attack could be a function which calls a certain characters attack and * 2.  I know games are not easy but my goal is to start small then move up. I like the OOP model because it seems to suit that method the best. I looked into using arrays for a characters stats but the syntax looked quite arcane. My first goal for a game is 1 room 1 player controlled character 1 enemy; 2d top down view. Something like this:http://www.digitalwhip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/34385-legend_of_zelda_the_-_a_link_to_the_past...Both characters can move north east south and west and attack. game ends when 1 character health = 0 I have made mods for age of kings the conquers. I was part of a project that (over years) figured out how to edit the stats in that game. i.e. health movement armor. Its interesting to note where in that game engine Ensemble Studios used floats and where they used ints.  Floats were used where more precise control was important; balance is key in rpgs. For example ints are used for health. However reload time uses the format x.xxx where 1.000 is = to 1 second. so - 0.500 from the reload time and reload is cut in half. Or to be more precise could -0.100 from reload. The value seems small but makes a big difference when there are 100s of units on the screen. ,None,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 3:21 pm -04:00,Do if statements loop or only run once? For example if I want to call a function called game_over when a characters hitpoints = 0...if hitpoints == 0   return(game_over) It seems that statement would only run once. Perhaps what I actually need is some type of while loop? Something like (in pesudocode) :while hitpoints >= 1 run mainloop.   elif:  return(game_over),None,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 3:22 pm -04:00,This assumes game_over is a function which ends the main game loop. ,None,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 9:06 am -04:00,HelloI get 19 out of 24. Ive looked over the failures and I think I know whats broken. However I wonder when I can post my code to see how to make it right. Im looking for the right answer after the assignment deadline because I have been unable to figure it out. Thank you kindly.Regards Tom, Unresolved,0
