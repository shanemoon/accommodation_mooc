Thursday September 26th 2013 8:35 am -04:00,this course is awesome and simple. but what about teaching us not just to write programms in command line or shell but to introduce us the basics of programming graphic user interface that our programms - the simple they are - yet look like usable apps. so im talking about windows frames button containers clicks mouse move. that would help u a lot. pls make some additional vids to this course that will not be considered by calculating the final grades but will be free to learn for everyone.THANKS.,None,3
