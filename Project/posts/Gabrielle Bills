Wednesday September 25th 2013 4:43 pm -04:00,Ive saved in UTF-8 format and Im still getting this error.  What should I do?, Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 5:00 pm -04:00,It is a txt file.  When I save the document I select the plain text option and later specify Unicode 5.1 UTF-8 ... What am I missing?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 5:29 pm -04:00,I have a mac and I originally tried using TextEdit but it didnt show Plain Text as one of the options for file format which I found confusing.  I can save a file as txt using Word and then when I open the file it opens in TextEdit.  I feel silly but these are the only options I can see for Save As in TextEdit:, Unresolved,0
