If you revised week 4 lectures you saw the operator inÂ to check if a particular substring appears inside a string. The same in operator works with lists so you can find if a specific word is in a list of words.You can solve this with only one line of code if you revisit the video No if required as wellHope it helps, Unresolved,1
