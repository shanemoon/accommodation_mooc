Wednesday September 18th 2013 10:23 am -04:00,Hi coders! Just want to say that I was very excited to find out that I can do the assignments on my phone. However I want to ask anyone who has experience with this App :do you know how to run the code in the shell? The is a run button but it only works if you code it such that there are special pop up boxes like the examples do. Would love to test my codes on my phone! , Unresolved,0
