Wednesday August 28th 2013 3:29 pm -04:00,oops youre right. Changed the title. Thanks!, Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 3:43 pm -04:00,Obviously its considering those parentheses as unnecessary but as we see here they are not unnecessary and furthermore gives a wrong tip: Remember that there needs to be a space after the word return, Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 3:54 pm -04:00,Yeah youre right., Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 3:40 pm -04:00,The question states: The line with the red arrow (line 15) is about to be executed. which means it hasnt been executed yet and as such wouldnt the only variable on stack be hours_asleep?, Unresolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 4:03 pm -04:00,So they could just simply say after executing the last line but I guess they wanted the problem description match the screenshot (or vice versa) so they made a little story there. :), Unresolved,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 12:58 pm -04:00,If on the other hand you have been avoiding using IDLE and youre struggling with the exercises then you arent learning as much as you should.I disagree. If you can predict the output without running the example in IDLE youre quite a few steps ahead of someone who just runs the code and observes the result. Copy -> paste -> run -> get answer needs no skills. :), Resolved,2
Monday September 23rd 2013 1:13 pm -04:00,I do struggle most of the time though. :) It also takes a lot longer to get to the answer without running the code considering I have to be pretty sure about the answer before submitting since number of tries isnt unlimited., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 2:33 am -04:00,Im using Python 3.3 and dont know why it doesnt complain about using copy().Anyway I changed it to [:] and now grader is complaining that list has no clear() attribute. Went and changed it to del and now guess what: you have to wait 58 minutes to resubmit., Resolved,0
