Friday September 13th 2013 8:23 am -04:00,Hi everyone .. Im still struggling with question4 (get_complementary_sequence)it was easy to do the previouse one (get_complement) as all we have to replace is 4 (strings)but now we have unlimited chars .. and I dont think we already studied replacing chars in python ..any idea how to work this out ?thank you, Unresolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 9:21 am -04:00,the  function get_complement is working well  ..so I reused the code and looped through it ..but then I didnt understand what you mean by keeping a record and returning itcan u clarify please?, Unresolved,0
