Monday September 16th 2013 5:23 pm -04:00,I think if an empty string is or isnt valid sequence is irrelevant. I do think it would have been nice if it was given as an example though. I assumed it wasnt a valid sequence and as such had to change my code after my first submission., Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 4:23 pm -04:00,Ive been a professional programmer for 15 years now and this course doesnt match my learning style. Heck it doesnt match how I program.,None,0
Monday September 16th 2013 4:49 pm -04:00,The new way to program is Test Driven Development aka TDD. This course doesnt teach that although that is how Im taking this course. This is teaching the old way of doing things.,None,0
Monday September 16th 2013 5:18 pm -04:00, In my experience its much harder to teach TDD to people with a lot of experience than those with little or no programming experience.I dont think a lot of software development theory is required. Testable == Good..... Untestable == Bad.,None,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 1:53 pm -04:00,The shift_left function modifies the list that is passed in to it. That is why the function doesnt return a value.myList = [012]shift_left(myList)myList would now be [120], Unresolved,2
Tuesday September 24th 2013 11:26 am -04:00,Ok found the code you are asking about. Look at the body of the function. There is no return statement in it. That is how you tell the list is being modified in place and a new list is not being return in its place. The list is what is referred to as mutable. (It can change after its created). This is opposed to something like a string in python which is called immutable (It cant change after its created).def shift_left(L):     (list) -> NoneType    Shift each item in L one position to the left    and shift the first item to the last position.    Precondition: len(L) >= 1            first_item = L[0]    for i in range(1 len(L)):        L[i - 1] = L[i]    L[-1] = first_item , Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 11:31 am -04:00,Anne Id suggest playing with code to help yourself understand. I pretty much do that all day long.Write a simple function that takes a string and a list. Then try to modify the string and list inside your function...Try something like:def shift_left(L name):    first_item = L[0]    for i in range(1 len(L)):        L[i - 1] = L[i]    L[-1] = first_item     name = Frankmy_name = Georgemy_list = [012]shift_left(my_list name)print(my_list)print(my_name)What would you expect the last two lines to print?, Unresolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 4:22 pm -04:00,I think the only problem has been poor instructions in some assignments. Also the feedback when you miss a question on an assignment isnt all that good. I think fixing these two issues fixes most of the problems. Although fixing the feedback issue on an autograder would be a rather hard problem., Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 4:28 pm -04:00,Python and Java are just different tools in the toolbelt. Sometimes a hammer or a screwdriver is the correct tool. Ive been coding Java for about 13 years. Redo assignment 3 in Java and feel the pain. Java sucks for working with files. Heck just redo the parts of the assignment where you have to read in the text files. Be ready for some serious code bloat to do the exact same thing.,None,0
