Sunday September 22nd 2013 5:53 pm -04:00,Dear Teacher Team Thank You for the course and the many new ideas what we can see here. (feedback tests meanwhile the videos essay-like well-developed program exercises and tests: made perfectly). I really enjoy this course with the Py environment albeit I am working aside more than 50 hours in a week so I have no chance to join to a course. And once more thank you because 5 years ago I couldn`t believe that one day I will learn computer programming interactively in the internet. And now I am thinking about a Raspberry Pi machine and imagine what can I built from it :-) Thank you for fun knowledge professionalism and inspiration., Resolved,1
Sunday September 22nd 2013 5:40 pm -04:00,Hi Graham My program is similar of Yours (and the Algorithm as well :-). And the assignment check says like Romans. The program is working with 0 char with multiple seqs. I have no idea. I think the error message is not equivalent with the problem : ) So we have to think/try more to solve the problem.Â  , Unresolved,0
