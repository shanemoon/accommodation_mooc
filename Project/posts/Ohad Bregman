Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:58 pm -04:00,HiLindaWhatyou include in the return statement is the expression that you want to return.Forexample lets make a function called area which takes baselength and height and height of a triangular and returns the areaHeresthe code:def area(base_length height):    return base_length * height /2And heres an example of running this code>>> area(56)15.0In the example that you gave the function takes a name of a city and returns the temperature. So the return statements should include the expression that gives the temperature. You dont need to include the parameters or any information that isnt needed for the calculation. For example in the is_passing_grade that you asked about the return statement is pass or fail because thats what we need to return and it doesnt include the grade.I hope that helped..., Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 1:32 pm -04:00,Heres the output I got when executing the function:>>> is_passing_grade(40)fail>>> is_passing_grade(67)passJust to check: after you inserted the code in IDLE did you run the module (by pressing F5 or choosing Run->Run Module)?In your return statement you shouldnt include temperature(city) but an expression that calculates the temperature using the argument: city., Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 3:30 am -04:00,Hi LindaSince were not required to write the function in the exercise I believe we can post our solutions here.You can write the function as followed:def is_passing_grade(grade):    if grade >=50:        return pass    else:        return failAnd heres another way:def is_passing_grade(grade):    return pass if grade >=50 else failPlease tell me if the answer is clear or if you need an explanation.If you need clarification regarding your solution please post it.UPDATE:  now I see that if statements are learnt only next week… So itsok if you dont understand the code that I posted... So for now you don’t have tounderstand how to write the body of the function only to understand thestructure of the function its arguments and its output., Resolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 8:57 am -04:00,As Marek said you should check your version of Python. I got the correct answer when using Python 3.3 however I managed to reproduce the result that you got (2.0) when using Python 2.7.3., Resolved,1
Thursday September 5th 2013 8:59 am -04:00,Since you can use convert_to_minutes (id1) and convert_to_seconds (id2) anywhere in theprogram (even within another function) those functions should be considered asglobal.However a function that is declared within another functionis considered as local to the function within which it is declared so you cantuse it outside this function.Try this with the Visualizer: def func1(a):    def func2(b):        return b**2    return a*3+func2(a)print (func1(5)), Unresolved,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 4:55 pm -04:00,HiYoudon’t need to download anything for this exercise. assignment.py andquestion.py are names of hypothetical files.Inorder to answer the question suppose that you have a file that contains somecode in Python which is called assignment.py. From this file you need to callfunctions from another hypothetical file called question.py. Howdo you do that?And regrading your second questions - the weekly exercises are in https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/quiz/index?quiz_type=homework while the Assignments (every other week) are in https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/assignment/index.You dont need the book in order to complete them., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 2:37 am -04:00,Hi James in this assignment were not required to address this issue (Isubmitted the assignment without taking care of the case of the inputs and gota perfect score).  , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:42 am -04:00,Youre right! What I meant in my reply to James is that you dont have to check for this or do anything that is connected to upper/lower case., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:40 am -04:00,Dont worry about this... If for example you need to check if chr is G the expression is chr==G (so we wont accept g as a valid character). Other than that you dont have to take care of this issue. I re-checked the assignment that I submitted and saw that I didnt use any function/method that dealt with the upper/lower case issue., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:52 am -04:00,I think that your code and mine work as designed: in my chr==G  example if chr is g this expression will return False as it should. So as the spec says A string is not a valid DNA sequence if it contains lowercase letters. If I say that I want to make sure that chr is G why should I care if  chr is g (the lowercase of G) or X? In both cases the expression will return False as it should..., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 11:03 am -04:00,In the example mentioned on the template for a2.pycontains_sequence(ATCGGC GG)the sequence GG is in ATCGGC but not at the beginning of the string (for example ATC) or at the end (for example GC). I assume based on the names of the tests that you mentioned that you didnt check those two cases.Try to run:contains_sequence(ATCGGC ATC)contains_sequence(ATCGGC GC)and see if you get True for those cases, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:12 am -04:00,I see that you have a space between the dot (.) and the letter c. This space has no influence on IDLE but maybe it seems wrong to the grader., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 9:59 am -04:00,Notice that a lowercase chr is NOT valid so you shouldnt allow it in dna. Make sure  your solutions return False  if dna includes chr like g t etc, Resolved,1
Sunday September 15th 2013 3:26 am -04:00,Yes!Define two strings one for the nucleotide and one for complementand make sure that the x-th character of complement is the complement ofthe x-th character of nucleotide.Imagine a code where A is replaced by Z B is replaced by Y etc.So If originalis ABCDE….Z the code is ZYXWV….A.Applysimilar logic to nucleotide and complement Andthen think of an expression you should include in your return statement thatlooks for the place of a certain chr in nucleotide and return the chr incomplement with the same place., Unresolved,1
Sunday September 15th 2013 5:14 am -04:00,Hi Mingyue. Have a look at the answer i gave to Mostafa. You dont need to apply any new concept here - just apply what we learnt about finding the place of a character in a string and slicing/indexing, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 5:11 am -04:00,Yes youre right! However I wasnt sure if we were allowed to use dictionaries here. In other Coursera course that I took the grader was very strict and didnt accept solution even if they were correct if they used forbidden functions/methods/structures, Unresolved,1
Sunday September 15th 2013 5:09 am -04:00,Lets go back to my example using the variables original and code. Suppose that were required to find the code for D. So we need to find the place (the index) of D in original (its 3 if we start counting from 0) and just return the chr in place 3 of code which is W. So you have to think how to apply what we learnt regarding finding the place of a character in a longer string and indexing/slicing a string., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 7:04 am -04:00,Notice that we dont need to add just to find the correct character in y according to the index in x., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 3:30 am -04:00,HiCould you paste the error code that you got here?, Unresolved,1
Sunday September 15th 2013 11:13 am -04:00,Do you have a return statement?, Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 17th 2013 4:16 am -04:00,As always when dealing with indexing/slicing using [a:b] notation were looking for all the characters from the a-th position to the b-th (not including the b-th position) so [i:i+1] is the i-th position to the i+1 -th position but excluding the i+1 - th position so it practically means only the character in the i-th position so to answer your question: s[i:i + 1] is just like s[i]. Try for example abcABCabcABC[5] and see that its equal to abcABCabcABC[5:6]., Resolved,18
