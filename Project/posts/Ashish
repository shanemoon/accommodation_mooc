Always remember such things are stored in the ram and later retrieved from the ram if needed. Whenever you create a variable :let the variable in this case be foo:foo is actually pointing at a certain memory location in the ram. This memory location is entirely chosen by python. After initializing the variable foo with a value the value is simply dumped into that memory location. Thus the entire process is achieved in this way., Resolved,2

I have a fair knowledge of C++ programming language but was later intrigued by python. Besides c++ i know basic JAVA  C# and HTML. I hope that every one here passes this course with flying colors...
