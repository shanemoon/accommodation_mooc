Tuesday September 24th 2013 1:38 pm -04:00,HiI seem to be completely stuck when putting together function make_str_from_column. Ive been back over documentation/my own notes and can see no clue how to reference an index in a sublist in a loop.Other people seem to be managing to do this so Im obviously missing something (or on completely the wrong track)...anyone got any pointers or can perhaps point me towards the lecture/exercise where relevant info might be found?Thanks in advance!, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 2:26 pm -04:00,Unfortunately that doesnt really help - when I wrote the body for make_str_from_row (which works fine just submitted it to be sure no errors) I didnt need to handle an index within any of the sublists - unfortunately I dont see any way to make make_str_from_column work without referencing an index within the sublists.I hope this makes sense thank you for your help, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 2:50 pm -04:00,I think I understand what I need to do not how to do it if that makes sense? I used a for loop on make_str_from_row the structure was as follows:for i in <parameter1>[<parameter2>]:The problem I have is I dont know how to make parameter2 the index for a sublist within my loop. In my mind this would work something like:for i in <parameter1>[*][<parameter2>]:Am I on the right track with this? Absolutely tearing my hair out at the moment., Resolved,0

Tuesday September 24th 2013 3:23 pm -04:00,Im there! I think. Tested it with a few different variables just need to submit to check but pretty sure Ive nailed. I was aggravatingly close...just a small addition to one of the lines feeling majorly dumb right now. Thanks very much for your help guys.Where I was going wrong was I was forgetting that within the for loop i refers to each argument within the variable thats being called - so in make_str_from_column i (or whatever you use Ive been using i as thats what been used in the lectures) refers to each list within the variable board. Unconsciously I was thinking of i as referring only to the letters held within the sublist...dont know if that makes sense but if it can help somebody else...Anyway woohoo! Only...7 more functions to go. Dang it., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 7:30 pm -04:00,Hi as post title says really struggling with the final function of this assignment read_board.  Heres where Im at thus far:1) I believe the goal here is generate a list of lists from a file (so from the example file board1.txt output would be [EFJAJCOWSS] [SDGKSRFDFF] etc...)2) Im using the completed read_words function to do the initial pulling in of the file which looks something like: read_words(board_file)I believe the output of this should look something like:[EFJAJCOWSS SDGKSRFDFF ASRJDUSKLK HEANDNDJWA ...you get the idea]The way Im currently trying to do this is using a nested loop...this isnt working though and to be honest Im starting to think Im overcomplicating things and missing something crucial. Anyone have any pointers on this one?Ive noticed this whole assignment seems to have really stepped up the difficulty a notch whole thing has been a real slog., Unresolved,3
