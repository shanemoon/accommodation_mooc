Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:10 am -04:00,if you think through the steps of your code logically from the for loop youre only testing for ANY instance of a correct match to produce a True result. So FOR the first letter of your input string: A IF it is in ATCG the result is true. Your code will produce a True no matter that there are lower case letters BECAUSE there are upper case which produces a True. Try thinking about testing each letter and keeping track of the process so that you get a false for GATTACAM. I tested your code and GATTACAM produces a True result despite the last letter being wrong., Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:16 am -04:00,your original code is 90% correct:set everything to True before your for loop then delete your test for True and keep your test for False... finally return the result ., Unresolved,0
