Tuesday August 20th 2013 7:19 am -04:00,I made this mistake also.  No prompt indicator means the shell thinks you are still entering function instructions.  Frustrated the heck out of me. I agree there should be some mention of getting back to the prompt in the defining functions video., Resolved,2
Monday August 19th 2013 11:39 pm -04:00,Ive tried to define a simple function and continue to get syntax errors. Frustrated I copied an example verbatim from a Python 3 Wiki and STILL get this error.  It would appear the program does not recognize my def statement?>>> def celsius_to_fahrenheit(c_temp):    return 9.0 / 5.0 * c_temp + 32celsius_to_fahrenheit(100)SyntaxError: invalid syntax, Resolved,2
Tuesday August 20th 2013 6:57 am -04:00,Thank you Gustavo!  After hitting enter twice after the return statement the prompt returned and the function could then be evaluated as expected.  In my frustration I hadnt noticed that there was no prompt.  I guess Im a rookie at this.   , Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 6:59 am -04:00,Thanks Kang!  That was the problem. I didnt hit the enter key twice to get back to the prompt.  All works now., Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 11:12 pm -04:00,Thank you Jaime for figuring out the approach the designer was asking for.  The grader wanted THE 4.  Thats all that needs to be said.......I think this question needs to be reworded.  Both the problem statement and explanation are garbled using words in unusual context.  I wrote an expression that evaluated to 4 and it was graded incorrect.  (I have a math degree and know what an expression is Obasi.  I also think that some of the Im so smart gobbledygook explanations in this thread were the polar opposite of helpful. ) , Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 10:34 pm -04:00,Im attempting to learn Python and R at the same time and the languages are so close I can get the commands confused writing code.  I think I like Python more due to its ease of use and breadth of applications.  But if you want to crunch big data frames R is king right now.,None,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 10:21 pm -04:00,Im on a Windows 7 pc.  Its probably simple but I havent a clue to this error.  Im trying to assign a variable to the pathname like lecture and getting this error:>>> wordslist_filepath = C:\Users\MSP\Documents\Python Files\LearnToProgram\wordslist1.txtSyntaxError: (unicode error) unicodeescape codec cant decode bytes in position 2-4: truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape, Resolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 10:55 pm -04:00,Thank you for the help Gan!  That worked.  It was those slashes.  I mindlessly copied backslashes from the shells recent files list and didnt realize.Mike, Resolved,0
