Monday September 30th 2013 10:55 pm -04:00,I had a lot of luck with running it through the visualizer. It helped me to see where my code got hung up. In my case (and probably most cases that have a problem with this portion) I needed to focus on what was going on with the range.In board_contains_word_in_row your range is range(len(board)). Your range is the length of board that is the number iterations your code will run. So how long is range(len(board)) and is that range also suitable for board_contains_word_in_column? I found that it was not so perhaps focus on changing the range in that function to run a more suitable number of times., Resolved,0

So underneath the function you might add board_contains_word_in_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]] NO) which is the example they give you in the docstring. When you watch the visualizer it will start at the top where you have def_board_contains_word... then it will jump down to that function you called then back up to run through the code. The visualizer needs you to call the function with arguments so it has something to show you. , Resolved,0
