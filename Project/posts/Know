Tuesday September 10th 2013 3:26 am -04:00,@ Jean PleschaI agree with the point you have made at the beginning. If you go back couple of lectures the type contract was changed in the convert_to_celsius(farenheit) example since the return value was multiplied by 5/9. The explanation given was since there is a division in the equation it will always return a float value. Although putting number in the type contract is correct as it includes all number types however going by that video I think float would be a better option than number as there is a division in this example as well. Both will be correct but float would be a better choice. Unless someone thinks otherwise?, Unresolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 6:23 pm -04:00, in abcCan anyone please explain how does the above expression result in True. Doesnt this mean that you have nothing in something. I know I should have read more philosophy :), Unresolved,1
Saturday September 14th 2013 12:43 am -04:00,lol...how about modern day philosophers teaching programming I presume their 1st program would be hello Philosophy!.Thanks for your help I still dont think I have understood it clearly. Need to start reading Sarte , Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 3:00 am -04:00,Thanks Nick makes more sense now within the python world of course.And definitely holds true in the philosophy world   , Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 5:43 am -04:00,If we go back few lectures back Week 4 more str operators the expression  in abcwould result in True however in the below example it would result in 0. Going by the above rule the result should be 11.I understand since it is a for loop each iteration is picking up a character which makes sense but in the above example it seems python is also counting space between character and also the space before and after the 1st and the last character resp.Is this a rule that I need to know because otherwise this may be get confusing in future when one wants to learn a lot more of python?Recall our code for the function count_vowels (shortened for space):def count_vowels(s):    num_vowels = 0    for char in s:         if char in aeiouAEIOU:            num_vowels = num_vowels + 1    return num_vowelsWhat will happen when we pass the empty string as the argument (that is count_vowels())?The for loop body will not execute and num_vowels will continue to refer to 0.The for loop body will execute 1 time with char referring to .The if condition will be True and num_vowels will then refer to 1. An error will be raised when Python tries to iterate through the empty string., Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 17th 2013 1:05 am -04:00,Not sure why the while loop does not return num. I have tried all the indentation options but it did not work.>>> num = 10>>> while num < 100:	num = num * 2	return(num)SyntaxError: return outside function>>> num = 10>>> while num < 100:	num = num * 2    return(num)SyntaxError: unindent does not match any outer indentation levelI have also tried other options but it has not worked. I suspect I may not something about return statement for while loops. can you someone help please?, Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 17th 2013 2:26 am -04:00,Thanks Tom and Tolunay. I am in the week 5 and dont know how I missed it. Can you direct me to the video which explains that return should always be called inside a function. I suspect I may have have missed that lecture altogether., Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 4:48 am -04:00,Struggling a bit reading and writing tutorials passed like a bullet. Had to watch it again and again before making sense out of it. Not complaining happy to revisit the video again :) Not sure if I was the only on who felt this? I do not understand how end= remove all the spaces from the paragraph. My understanding is that  only comes at the end of the file so how could it remove spaces? Are  and  not different?, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 3:47 pm -04:00,Thanks for your response. I think I am almost here but have not fully understood it.Are we saying that by entering end= we are telling print that instead of using the default  use  at the end of each line. Which of course means that there will not be a new line but no space because end = ?, Resolved,0

Friday September 27th 2013 4:21 am -04:00,After running the below code;import tkinter.filedialogfrom_dest = tkinter.filedialog.askopenfilename()to_dest = tkinter.filedialog.asksaveasfilename()During file save execution I do not receive any error everything goes fine however file is not saved in the destination directory on windows. I ran >>> to_destC:/Documents and Settings/eshan/Desktop/copytest.txtand although it gave me the destination of the saved file name(copytest.txt) but the file did not actually not saved. I used search explorer used windows explorer to directly access the file but the file does not exist. Repeated this many times but in vain, Resolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 1:57 am -04:00,Guys I think the problem is different here. I conducted 3 tests one with Toms (Thanks Tom :)) suggestion above 2nd with saveasfilename method and the other with just open command. Here are the results;Test 1;import tkinter.filedialogfrom_dest = tkinter.filedialog.askopenfile(mode=r)from_open = open(from_dest r) from_open.readline()from_open.readline()from_open.readline()from_open.readline()from_open.readline()print(from_dest)from_open.close()Result;Traceback (most recent call last):  File C:\Python33\Projects\write_file.py line 3 in <module>    from_open = open(from_dest r)TypeError: invalid file: <_io.TextIOWrapper name=C:/Documents and Settings/eshan/Desktop/test.txt mode=r encoding=cp1252>==============================================================================Test 2;import tkinter.filedialogfrom_dest = tkinter.filedialog.askopenfilename()from_open = open(from_dest r) from_open.readline()from_open.readline()from_open.readline()from_open.readline()from_open.readline()print(from_dest)from_open.close()Result;>>>>>> C:/Documents and Settings/eshan/Desktop/test.txt>>> >>>================================================================================Test 3;>>> from_dest = C:\\Documents and Settings\\eshan\\Desktop\est.txt>>> from_open = open(from_dest r)Result;>>> from_open.readline()ANDREW NG>>> from_open.readline()>>> from_open.readline()Co-CEO Co-Founder>>> from_open.readline()>>> from_open.readline()Hi!

I read it on a thread on an external forum that python does the accept windows file path type.I thought many would have faced this problem but dont see similar threads for such scenario so either everyone knows how to deal with it or very few people use windows or I am still missing a step or two., Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 4:44 am -04:00,Thanks Ok guys I see the problem in this but what is the problem with test 2? Also once I remove open() I still do not get the response.I am in a rush am going to the office and so will be able to see it once I am back. Thanks, Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 3:10 pm -04:00,Hi Tom thanks for being patient.Shouldnt from_open.readline() print line from the file? , Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 4:32 pm -04:00,Hey TomThanks a ton I think I am bit confused on how differently shell works compared to a script written on a window. I assumed running;from_open.readline()would return the line from the file but it has not. Can you give me some more info or direct me to a source which describes distinction between shell and a new python window clearly., Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 4:45 pm -04:00,and also I am still struggling with the saving the file which is the real problem I have created this for. And although I have realized few mistakes I had made however the original problem still persists. If the I run the below code provided it is correct is giving me an error below (after the code block). Let me know what you thinkimport tkinter.filedialogfrom_dest = tkinter.filedialog.askopenfilename()from_open = open(from_dest r) to_dest = tkinter.filedialog.asksaveasfilename()to_open = open(to_dest r)Traceback (most recent call last):  File C:\Python33\Projects\write_file.py line 6 in <module>    to_open = open(to_dest r)FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: C:/Documents and Settings/eshan/Desktop/copytest.txt, Resolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 4:01 pm -04:00,Thank you guys I have managed to open and save file and I would say I am starting to understand how the file saving works. I would have to say that these tutorials passed like a bullet. Anyhow they have been greatly useful over all and even if I need to do a lot reading to understand this bit it is fine.Thank you Tom for sticking in :))and Thanks to Anonymous (Sorry dont know your name)., Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 1:34 am -04:00,Isnt the file chosen by default or can we change how python stores file destination on asksaveasfilename()?

Saturday September 28th 2013 2:11 am -04:00,The above is a valid file. I think it is to do with how windows stores file destination which is something python cant digest but I dont know how to fix it for this module., Unresolved,0
