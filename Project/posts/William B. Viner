Monday September 16th 2013 3:20 pm -04:00,I too got an error on is_valid_sequence on my first submission. I too was upset and thought the error was incorrect. However when I reread the assignment the description for the function says Return True if and only if the DNA sequence is valid (that is it contains no characters other than A T C and G). Since  does not contain any characters other than A T C and G True is the correct value to return., Unresolved,0
