Friday September 27th 2013 2:21 pm -04:00,Im with you Manish - it is phrased vaguely enough as to incur doubt. , Resolved,2
Thursday September 26th 2013 3:35 pm -04:00,Just to echo everyone else - I appreciate you walking us through a mini project like this. Learning how to think like a programmer is probably the hardest thing to teach but this was a great step in that direction - thank you! Hopefully you have time to put together another 1 or 2 of these before the course ends - possibly from Jennys point of view for the next one :), Unresolved,2
Saturday September 28th 2013 6:46 pm -04:00,Been stuck at 30/37 for a few hours now... no matter what I fix I seem to get the same error...Enter player 2 name: Traceback (most recent call last):  File /Users/robert/Documents/Python_Scripts/a3_driver.py line 100 in <module>     play_game(players board words)  File /Users/robert/Documents/Python_Scripts/a3_driver.py line 45 in play_game        num_remaining = a3.num_words_on_board(board words) - len(found_words)  File /Users/robert/Documents/Python_Scripts/a3.py line 190 in num_words_on_board         for word in words:TypeError: NoneType object is not iterableIt refers back to this function:def num_words_on_board(board words):     (list of list of str list of str) -> int    Return how many words appear on board.        num_words = 0        for word in words:         if board_contains_word(board word):                          num_words = num_words + 1        return num_wordsWhich correctly returns an integer. Any thoughts?, Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 8:21 pm -04:00,Stupid mistake in another place. If you are getting a NoneType error it is likely because you forgot to return something or commented it out as was my case. 37/37 - time for a beer!, Resolved,1
Saturday September 28th 2013 8:19 pm -04:00,That looks correct - did you remember to return the board?, Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 8:58 pm -04:00,Sorry - I wasnt clear. Returning the list that represents the board - which sounds like you did. , Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 9:00 pm -04:00,So I was struggling with the last 2 functions. For me it was making sure I followed the type contract and I also had an issue with making sure it was reading the correct file. Not sure if I can offer much help beyond that. The list of list of str you provided is the board though. , Resolved,1
Saturday September 28th 2013 9:57 pm -04:00,Awesome! Glad you can enjoy the rest of your weekend :), Resolved,1
