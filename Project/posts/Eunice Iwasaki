Thursday August 29th 2013 11:32 pm -04:00,HiI dont think I have done the right thing because I keep getting different points first it was 5 then 6 then 7 and then back to 1 after I have submitted all the assignments. Can someone please take a look and tell me the correct way of submitting the assignments. Thanks., Resolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 12:22 pm -04:00,So there must be 2 submissions: first submit Step 2 second submit the completed a1.py file. The system cannot accept 1 submission of completed a1.py file?, Resolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 9:44 pm -04:00,I am still having problem in submitting my assignment. Today I submitted again Step 2 and I got 5 points. I then submitted the entire completed a1.py file and I got the following result. I have tested all the functions and they worked in the Python Shell. I would appreciate a staff to let me know what I have done wrong.Thanks.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Week 2 Assignment (Assignment 1) | Assignment1Submission timeSat-31-Aug 10:22:29Raw Score0.00 / 41.00FeedbackAutotesting (Version 0.0.14)Report was generated in: 01:22:33 - 31/08/2013Summary: Test results statistics - All=8; Errors=8; Failures=0; Successes=0; Warnings=0.

Saturday August 31st 2013 3:15 am -04:00,Dear AnonThanks your response. I have successfully submitted my assignment. The system accepted the submission of each additional step to the a1.py file.Now I can take a deep sigh of relief., Resolved,1
Sunday September 1st 2013 4:16 am -04:00,Hi AjayiInstead of editing the a1.py file I followed the sample provided and created my own a1.py file. After completing the body (which is return .......) for Step 2 I tested the example calls for the expected results using the Python Shell. Then I submit my a1.py file. It should show 5 pts. I submitted my a1.py file every time I finished and tested a Step. You will find that the points keep increasing. The get_minutes and get_seconds functions are a bit tricky. I had error the first time because I was using the minus sign. Someone in the discussion forum suggested using % and it worked.Although its tedious I find that I learn better by typing out each function. Hope this helps. , Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 4:38 am -04:00,Hi SaralThe body for to_24_hour_clock function has already been provided: return hours % 24. The to_24_hour_clock function is to show you how to use % to get rid of the 24 hours as seen in the first two example calls for (24) and (48) both returning 0. The use of % comes in useful when you write the body for get_minutes and get_seconds function.Hope this helps., Resolved,1
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:01 pm -04:00,The correct answer is based on the instruction: To access a function within a module we use ...However it gives me error when I tested it.Can someone explain why., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 9:57 pm -04:00,The module used in the problem is different from the sample import math - it is shown at the top above the header. Access the function (which is already provided in the problem) from this module and followed by the sidelengths as shown., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 4:06 am -04:00,You are required to rewrite the one line return call by quoting the module_name.function_name followed by the sidelengths. The problematic return call in the assignment has the module_name missing which can be found above the header., Unresolved,0
