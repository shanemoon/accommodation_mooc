Monday August 19th 2013 6:59 pm -04:00,Hi DennisI thinks thats great. After all youre only half-way though your working life why should you resign yourself to the same thing for the next 20 years?Â Im hoping to move into a software/solutions development direction but I do have the advantage of already working in IT albeit in a sys/admin role.Hope it works out for you,None,0
Monday August 19th 2013 6:51 pm -04:00,Hi JayDo you think the opportunities for applying Python in a paid arena can match what you can earn through your VBNET skills? Although I see plenty of recruitment ads for Python it seems .NET is still the safer bet for a pro. Im curious to how that looks from where you are...,None,0

Monday September 30th 2013 4:34 pm -04:00,Hi Kevin interesting findings there! I think what you have shown is that functions can be aliased but are not mutable. So you can assign a function to multiple variables but if you change it it will only change for the variable you referenced when making the change - automatically recreating the function + changes in a new memory address. If you then reverse your changes you have two functions in two seperate memory areas that just happen to have identical code. You could always assign the variable back to the original function and let the spawned copy get garbage collected., Resolved,0
