Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:39 pm -04:00,I am not sure if the following in video quiz answer andexplanation is correct. (no if required video # 6)Givea new one line body for the following function:def same_abs(num1 num2)     (number number) -> bool    Return True if and only if num1 and num2have the same absolute value.    >>> same_abs(12.5 -12.5)    True    >>> same_abs(3 4.5)    False        if abs(num1) == abs(num2):        return True    else:        return False In my mind the one line to get the correct answer:return abs(num1) - abs(num2) == 0 Anythoughts?, Unresolved,0
