Wednesday August 21st 2013 4:13 pm -04:00,Hi    Using id(...) built-in function I was checking addresses of variables different types. Looking on those addresses I couldnt find any logic. The only thing I noticed is that addresses of integers and floats are small when you compare to strings addresses.I know this is not really important in python but its just my curiosity.  , Unresolved,0
