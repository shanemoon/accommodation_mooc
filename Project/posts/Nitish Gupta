Friday September 13th 2013 12:28 pm -04:00,def count_nucleotides(dna nucleotide):     (str str) -> int    Return the number of occurrences of nucleotide in the DNA sequence dna.    >>> count_nucleotides(ATCGGC G)    2    >>> count_nucleotides(ATCTA G)    0        count = 0    for char in dna:        if char in nucleotide:            count = count + 1            return countMy Code breaking after one repetition of IF loop. I am not getting the expected results with above code.******************OUTPUT**********************>>> count_nucleotides(ATCGGC G)1I am getting 1 above instead of twoPlease check, Resolved,0

Saturday September 14th 2013 2:33 am -04:00,Finally after lots of hit and trials on the bug I am posting my code. Apologies if someone dont like it.def is_valid_sequence(dna):    new = True    for char in dna:        if char not in ATCG:            new = False            return new        else:            return newThis code is breaking for  or single A Letters. Also doesnt seems to be fine in few other lower case letters. Please suggest on how to proceed further.Thanks a lot to my Python Family. :), Unresolved,0
