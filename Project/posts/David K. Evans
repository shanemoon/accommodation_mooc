Monday August 19th 2013 2:47 am -04:00,You may find that you have to use software packages in your classes and in your job. In such cases you will have to at least write enough of a program to call those packages and possibly create printed output or use the results to feed into another standard function etc.You may even have to learn assembler because lots of times thats all that is available in the low level hardware. My condolences if you do.You say you are in Egypt no political discussion but heres a wish for you and your family to be safe.,None,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 7:39 pm -04:00,I just finished the course. Im an old time programmer who began with Fortran on punch cards. I loved the course! Thank you for your time and effort and for avoiding the Monty Python inside jokes even though it was a Python course. I have a few algorithms I want to develop. They will end up in another language (C or Fortran most likely) but it will be so incredibly easy to develop and test them in Python. What a great language!See you in the follow-up course., Unresolved,24
