Monday September 2nd 2013 12:54 pm -04:00,I dont know if this is relevant to your discussion - but my Idle also looks like the screen shot above. I do however get the RUN option once I open the New Window and save my .py file.The run command is on the menu bar of the saved file. When I ran the module I was able to execute in the shell as expected.  I cannot-however find a way to place the .py file inside the shell as demonstrated in the lecture.- Anyone know how to do that?, Unresolved,0
