Saturday September 28th 2013 11:54 am -04:00,I am enjoying this assignment BUT my progress came to a halt when I started writing the function read_words(). The docstring is not clear and is vague atleast in my understanding. I may be missing something or may not be ready.What do you mean by (file open for reading)? I am confused and do not know how to give this argument to the function? I will appreciate if you can please give us an example. , Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 2:58 am -04:00,Sepand here is the code I typed: Just the starter code. Please do not look at the missing docstring etc. Just to test the conceptdef read_words(words_f):    word_file = open(words_f r)    words = word_file.readlines()    close(word_file)    return wordsand I get the following error in the IDLE environment:read_words(C:\Users\syed.jaffar\Desktop\words_file.txt)SyntaxError: (unicode error) unicodeescape codec cant decode bytes in position 2-3: truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape Thanks for your earlier post but where am I going wrong. I must be doing something silly! Thanks a ton and have a good day., Resolved,0

Sunday September 29th 2013 11:40 pm -04:00,GreetingsCan you please give an example of how the file that contains the board look like? I am not sure.The way the words are laid out in the file will affect the code. Are the words separated by blank spaces or commas ...Thanks a ton., Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 5:19 am -04:00,Thanks and the output should be [looking at the example you sent][[abcd]  [wxyz]]Is it correct?, Unresolved,0
