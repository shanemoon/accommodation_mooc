Friday October 4th 2013 1:00 am -04:00,HiIm having a problem with this function board_contains_word_in_column.I have used for column_index in range(len(board)):to determine the length of the board that gets passed in - which I know is incorrect. I have therefore tried some alternatives such as     rows =  for column in board:     rows = rows + column[0] cols = len(rows)to try and get the correct length of the columns. Whatever I do it doesnt seem to work.I added a print function and noticed that even though my column_index = 2 range is set to range is start at 0 and end at 3 by code still comes out of the loop when the column_index is at 2?I cant seem to get passed this issue Ive read through other posts and see that people have similar issue but still cant figure out the solution.I know I should do len(board) as this will just count number of items in board (which might only be 2) but I need to count the individual items within the list.even if I hardcode the range as 4 the code still exists the loop too early so clearly something is wrong with the FOR statement.any help would be greatly received.Thanks Phil , Resolved,0
