Tuesday September 3rd 2013 8:52 pm -04:00,It may just be me and my poor understanding of English but the phrasing of this question had me confused for a long time so Im throwing this out there in case it helps anyone. Select the code fragment(s) that prints the average of all passing grade(s). The printed value should be 0.0 if neither grade is a passing grade the passing grade if exactly one grade is a passing grade and the average of the two grades if both are passing grades.What I understood from this was that if only one of the two gradesÂ  was a passing grade the printed value should be 50 (the minimum passing grade!). I obviously couldnt find a right answer and its only later I realized that what was meant was that the printed value should be the actual value of the grade that is higher than 50., Unresolved,5
