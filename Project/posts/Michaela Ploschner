Thursday September 5th 2013 2:37 pm -04:00,I have tried installing the local version of Python Visualiser as you suggested and it now works even in OSX! Thank you so much!! Something must be blocking the communication with the server. Thank you again for your help Joshua and Adrian., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 5:08 pm -04:00,Thanks a lot for replies. I have tried cleaning the cache and cookies installed firefox - still the same result. I do not think it is a coding problem Adrian as I used the example code without change with the same result. Btw. the same code works on Windows machine that I tested at work. I made sure java is enabled on my system but that does not help. I have installed Ubuntu in VirtualBox and run in there but it would be more convenient to run it in OSX. If anyone else encounters the same problem with OSX 10.8.4 please let me know. It must be something strange., Resolved,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 4:56 am -04:00,The reason why I dont think it is a code problem is because I dont get any results even if I use direct link with code from lectures. Otherwise I would have posted my code here for you to see.Thanks anyway., Resolved,0
