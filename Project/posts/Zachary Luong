Wednesday August 21st 2013 12:03 pm -04:00,Hello guys! Im turning 17 I started learn to program to make cheat codes and hacks for an online game(and boy was I wrong). I started learning C++ and now I can make a game using C++. Im here today because my friends recommended me to study python.Glad too meet you all! Hope to learn a lot from you guys,None,0
Wednesday August 21st 2013 1:45 pm -04:00,Yeah. Basically I want to learn as much as I can about programming the cheating dream had long gone. This course teaches the basics of programming and also Python which is really good to see how much programming knowledge did i get out of C++ and learning a new language is never bad for a programmer. I might like Python more than C++ who knows :D,None,0
Monday August 26th 2013 1:31 am -04:00,C++ and Java both have their pros and cons but Java is open source.I learned C++ from a book called Accelerated C++ near the end I lost my interest and started looking at C++ graphics library.I managed to make a game that plays like mario but has crappy graphics(i use colored blocks instead of drawn characters) and it had only 1 level.If you plan to study C++/ Java on your own dont just get a book and start from scratch find someone to help you(Object Oriented Programming aint easy) or read the book and watch youtube videos thenewboston is my favourite channel for programming tutorial.btw if you want to learn how to make a game(in Java)download Greenfoot and have a look at their Wombat tutorial.,None,0
