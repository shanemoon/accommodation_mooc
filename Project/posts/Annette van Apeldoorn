Wednesday August 28th 2013 4:09 pm -04:00,I do not understand why in the final quiz in the lecture visualizing function calls the correct answer is 300.The function convert_to_minutes has num_hours as its parameter.As far as i can tell nowhere in the code num_hours gets assigned a value. There is the variable hours_asleep but this variable is not used in the function convert_to_minutes. So how does num_hours end up Â as 5 (since the answer is supposed to be 5*60=300). Any further explanation would be appreciated!, Resolved,5
