Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:46 am -04:00,Not reallythere are functions lower and upper for that.ord gets the ASCII code of a letter and chr gives the character of the ASCII code in the argument!, Resolved,0
Thursday August 22nd 2013 11:50 am -04:00,codeskulptor basically runs python 2 with some functions from python 3 !so i recommend http://www.compileonline.com/execute_python3_online.php or http://brython.info/tests/console.html (which you ca also download to your computer and run in the browser), Resolved,2

Saturday August 24th 2013 4:43 pm -04:00,for the first problem the range you are inputing is bigger than the data lines.for the second use this code:data = ([Beryllium 4] [magnesium 12] [calcium 20] [strontium 38] [barium 56] [radium 88])data_max = max([word for row in data for word in row if isinstance(word int)])print data_maxcheers,None,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 4:43 am -04:00,the function isinstance(word int) checks if an element of the inner lists is a number (integer here).the for row in data for word in row part is a double for loop that iterates every sublist and every element in the sublist to check if it is an integer.the [word ...] part builds a new list of only the elements that are integers in the first given complex list (data).And the max() function finds the biggest of the elements of the new list. The whole thing except max() is called list comprehension because replaces some lines of code with one!I know this is an introductory course but many people are willing to absorb more than others (learning by example).,None,0
