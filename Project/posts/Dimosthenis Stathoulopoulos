Sunday September 22nd 2013 3:35 pm -04:00,Sorry if anyone can help . I submit my a2.py before i move forward to Step3  i did only the a2.py and althoug i checked the codes i wrote and they are correct and they fuction on Python Idle  after my submission the test examiner finds that i have 4.00/24.00 only correct.Does anybody knows why ? , Resolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 4:08 pm -04:00,I get error in the steps i have not started yet like step3 and step4 and this i can understand it  but i get also failures in codes that i have tested them and they fuction good . For example:def count_nucleotides(dna nucleotide) i have this as a code : if nucleotide in dna:         print(dna.count(nucleotide))    else:         print(0)if you test in Python IDLE it is correct as a code  it always returns the number of nucleotides . The test examiner  has it like failure .I dont understand why.The same happens in the def is_longer  and in contains_sequence . My answers are : 1)def is_longer : if dna1 > dna2:      returnTrue    else:      returnFalse2)def contains_sequence if dna2 in dna1 :        print(True)    else :        print(False)i am not sure if they are correct but i can definetely say that Python Idle returns the correct result . Thank you for your time , Resolved,0

Sunday September 22nd 2013 4:59 pm -04:00,Tom thank you very very much  as for the return use i didnt know that grader doesnt recognise print  so this was fixed!!!! As for the is_longer from what i understood i thought that the length is measured from the letters but i dont know any other expression to use than < > = to measure length . Sorry if my english is bad . i cant explain better .I understand what you say but i just cant find anything else than < > = to compare dna1 and dna2  Anyway Thanks you again for your kindness and  . for your help! , Unresolved,0
