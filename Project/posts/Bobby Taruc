Saturday August 31st 2013 10:36 pm -04:00,Am struggling with step 5 and have spent hours re reading instructions:The parameter is a number of seconds since midnight. Return the number of hours that have elapsed since midnight as seen on a 24-hour clock. (You should call to_24_hour_clock to convert the number of full hours to a time on a 24 hour clock. This means that the return value should be in the range 0 to 23 inclusive.)Since the parameter is in seconds after midnight shouldnt the return value be in seconds? May be am not understanding the meaning of parameter. Help!!, Unresolved,0

Saturday September 7th 2013 9:59 pm -04:00,Thanks for all the explanations. Key here is the OR operand stops evaluating other operands if it evaluates the first operand to be TRUE. , Unresolved,0

But I cannot get past this sample as well.in the example of calculating the area of trianglewhy was semi defined assemi =  semiperimeter (side1 side2 side3)I ask because the function semiperimeter can be re used i.e. couldnt semi be defined as:semi = semiperimeter??, Unresolved,1

Thursday September 19th 2013 11:25 pm -04:00,I get that. Somehow the get_length has to be equated to a len function. I have tried every which way and I get this output:>>> get_length(ATCG)<function get_length at 0x00F83A08>, Unresolved,0
