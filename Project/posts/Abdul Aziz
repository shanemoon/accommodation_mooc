Saturday August 31st 2013 3:18 pm -04:00,I did both the week 1 and week 2 quizes watched the videos and did the assignment. Scored above 90%. My only one quiz went bad. Dont know may be I was just not paying as much attention as I should. But most of the things are good and I think for now. I have scored more than 95% in all of the tests and assignments. I just started yesterday. 24 hours didnt even pass. I want to learn and learn. Thanks a lot. I just have no words its free and its superb. Education really should be like this. I love E-LEARNING. Im going to see this GUI clock soon. THANKS,None,5
