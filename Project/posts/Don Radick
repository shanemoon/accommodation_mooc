Tuesday August 20th 2013 12:37 pm -04:00,@ Vijay - I hear you!  You will want to enroll in https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython - pretty challenging Python class - moves fast lots of coding homework and exercises., Resolved Locked,3
Thursday August 29th 2013 8:22 am -04:00,I essentially audited the 2012 session of this course after it concluded and was a bit critical of the teaching methodology in that requiring the student to actually write code did not seem to be emphasized.  Im glad to see that actually writing Python code is required - IMHO its essential to learning a programming language. , Resolved,1
Thursday August 29th 2013 5:01 pm -04:00,Yep I learned a long time ago that you couldnt learn a language from a book without actually writingcode and debugging the inevitable mistakes.  Dont know how I ever missed the homework from the 2012 session.Thanks Jen!, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:23 am -04:00,Im not a fan of using a counter for this.  Your code is actually very close to working perfectly!Instead of testing for inclusion try testing for the inverse or negative for char in dna:        if char in ATCG:Try this (Pseudo code:)  for char in dna:      if char not in ATCG:          return False      else:         (all chars are in ATCG so True.....)Hope I didnt cross the line...., Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 18th 2013 8:55 am -04:00,works correctly for me....>>> s = 0123456789>>> n = s * 2>>> print(n)01234567890123456789>>> n = n +  >>> print(n)01234567890123456789 >>> print( + n + )01234567890123456789 >>> , Resolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 9:01 am -04:00,Question 2 - no the order of the functions in the file does not make a difference:>>> def call_functions():	func_a()	func_b()	>>> def func_a():	print(in func_a bubba)	>>> def func_b():	print(in func_b ya rube)	>>> call_functions()in func_a bubbain func_b ya rube>>> ,None,0
Friday September 27th 2013 6:50 am -04:00,Ive completed the code and the game appears to run well.(Using Python 3.3 on Ubuntu 13.04)But when I submit the code for scoring I have a number of errorsor failures that are tough to figure out.For example:test_a3.Test_11_NumWordsOnBoard.test_01_return_type==================================Method Description:NoneMessage:ERROR: TypeErrorin <string> requires string as left operand not int==================================Of course I return an integer for num_words_on_board(board words)and the code in that function contains:    for word in range(len(words)):But the error states that word is not a string.....Ive got a couple of other errors and failures in my score but Ill focus on this for now.regards yall!, Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 7:58 am -04:00,Im very sure that the function is correct  - word is a passed parameter and it is a string.Ive checked the functions that call this one and they seem to always pass a string also.the function itself is just 5 or 6 lines long.  Pretty straightforward., Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 11:50 am -04:00,Thanks Anon - of course you are right: for x in range() produces an integer.All fixed now got a 37/37 on this assignment., Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 2:58 pm -04:00,You can automatically run doctest from the command line if you put this at the bottom of your source.py module:if __name__ == __main__:    import doctest    doctest.testmod()This will report just the failing tests.If you want to see passing tests also just use:python source.py -v, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 3:01 pm -04:00,Its strange Ive got a couple of doctest fails for some functions but they look like they should have passed!File a3.py line 59 in __main__.make_str_from_columnFailed example:    make_str_from_column([[A N T] [X S A] [D E F]] 2)Expected:    TAF    Got:    TAFand File a3.py line 83 in __main__.board_contains_word_in_rowFailed example:    board_contains_word_in_row([[A N T T] [X S O B]] BET)Expected:    False       Got:    FalseStrange - I cant figure out how these were reported as fails., Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 4:58 pm -04:00,Thanks Etienne - Still a mystery - heres my docstrings from the code: >>> board_contains_word_in_row([[A N T T] [X S O B]] BET)    False       and>>> make_str_from_column([[A N T] [X S A] [D E F]] 2)    TAF    , Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 6:30 am -04:00,I was very gratified to find that the behavior of doctest was not random.I had a bit of whitespace after the return variable in the doctest string.Eliminating that white space - making sure that a  immediately follows thevariable solved the false report.  Ive now configured my editor (Kate) to highlight trailing spaces.thanks again for the support!, Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 5:48 pm -04:00,One of my answers was scored incorrect (the tuple) - but my Python Essential Reference states lists dictionaries and tuples containing mutable objects cannot be used as dictionary keys.Am I missing some subtlety here?, Resolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 4:55 am -04:00,OK thanks., Resolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 10:13 am -04:00,I struggled with a low score and confusing Autograder messages even when my code worked fine.Make sure that are reading the board file into a list of list of strings. (Read the function signature!)Print (gasp!) the board to make sure it looks like board = [[ABCD] [EFGH]] , Unresolved,0
