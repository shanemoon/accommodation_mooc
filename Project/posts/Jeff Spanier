Wednesday August 28th 2013 8:35 pm -04:00,Look back on calling on a function with another function and some of the different operators we learned such as % or //.The parameter is the number of seconds since midnight so everything will be given in seconds...how do you convert seconds to minutes and hours?I agree writing it out on paper really helps to visualize the steps that need to be taken.Good luck!, Resolved,1
