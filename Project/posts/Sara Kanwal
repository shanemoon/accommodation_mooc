Sunday September 15th 2013 6:47 am -04:00,Hi Everyone I am just a novice here to programming but I am so passionate about it. I am still stuck at Assigment 1  I figured out some sort of code for time to UTC but the code works only half way around - in short its not a functional code. Can anyone pleaseeeeeeeee help me out here. Can we share the full codes over here? Now that the hard deadline has also been passed. Please help!Thank you so much!, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 6:49 am -04:00,I think that they must delete or would reset the forums whatever may be the case but it is not very just with those who are stuck at just a few code lines pleaseeeeeee help my code is almost done its the UTC to time that works for first 12 hours but not from 13 to 24th hour of day. creepy. Please help, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 6:51 am -04:00,It should be allowed to share the answers after the hard deadline. By all means the courses are aimed to promote learning. How are we going to learn if we can move beyond our stuck point in an assignment. I canf focus on other lectures or exercises or assignment 2 - because my mind is stuck at assignment 1! , Unresolved,0
