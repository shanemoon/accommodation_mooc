Monday September 2nd 2013 3:06 pm -04:00,Over the weekend my grade changed from 41/41 to 42/41 and now its showing 34/41 ! There are errors showing in sections test_time_from_utc and test_time_to_utc when there were none before. Could one of the staff please verify if I need to fix my assignment or if theres a glitch?ThanksChristopher , Unresolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 3:35 pm -04:00,Ive only submitted it once it got 100% so that should have been it. The mark itself has changed so the highest one would be 34/41 now., Unresolved,0
