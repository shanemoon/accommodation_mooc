Sunday September 15th 2013 4:23 am -04:00,Fred youve asked a lot of questions here so its a little hard to know how to start answering them but Ill try to go through one by one (also: Im a student not a lecturer so no guarantees Im doing things the right or the best way!).First of all: you submit assignments by going to the assignments link on the main screen choosing the assignment youre submitting then clicking the submit button to upload your .py file.Second: The visualiser is located on the internet here:Â http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.htmlThree and four: Once you have Idle open select File -> New Window to open a new window to edit it or use File -> Open to open an existing file (such as a1.py if youre working on your first assignment). You can resize the windows by grabbing the edges of it and moving it to where you need it. If you resize the shell and the editor to both be about half the size of your screen then you can place them side by side. If you have the windows maximised (which means you wont be able to grab the edges) then just double click in the title bar at the top to minimise them so you can grab the edges.Hope that helps!, Pinned Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 4:17 am -04:00,Hi everyone! Im submitting my assignments as I complete each question to make sure Im on track as Im progressing. Im noticing that sometimes I get a FAILURE and sometimes I get an ERROR but Im struggling to work out what the difference is. For example does ERROR show only if the code isnt present and FAILURE if the code actually fails? Or similar? Thanks for all the great feedback and everything so far :), Pinned Resolved,0
