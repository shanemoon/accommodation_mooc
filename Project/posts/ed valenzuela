Wednesday September 4th 2013 11:07 am -04:00,I believe the thin grey line on their left you refer to is the vertical line which shows on the left side of Global frame ... greeting .. id1  in the Frames section of the Visualizer. If there is a single thin grey line it must mean there is only 1 stack frame. If there are two separate thin grey lines there are two stack frames? The logic doesnt seem to agree with the answers (whatever the correct answers are). Could the administrators produce a mini-lesson on stack frames and how you know how many you have? Why is this important for programming in the first place? on third attempt got 14 right but 15 and 16 wrong using this logic. How do you get the red line to the same spot in the Visualizer as it appears in the question?, Unresolved,5
Wednesday September 4th 2013 11:57 am -04:00,I know you move the red line by clicking the Forward button but it skips 2 lines and doesnt move to the same line as in the question. Is there some other way to get the red line to move in single steps or is the question just a fictional construct., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 12:44 pm -04:00,Oh wow! Now I see how it works! That makes a big difference when you finally get to the right line. Thanks now I finally got 1415 and 16 correct. But I skipped the other 13 questions in order to do this so will have to go back and do the exercise one more time. Thanks Adrian!, Unresolved,1
