Wednesday September 4th 2013 6:58 pm -04:00,For me the new instructions in Step 2 help a lot - I need the specific instructions as to what line to put the return statement on and how to Run Module to test it out. However I am still getting an error - TypeError: seconds_difference() missing 1 required positional argument: time_2, Pinned Resolved,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 12:20 am -04:00,Thank you for your response. I did use abs to get a positive number but am trying to wrap my head around if/then conditions. So I type return then the formula that gets the responses in the examples except that when I get an answer of 29 I dont know how to subtract 24 hours or to call to_24_hour_clock . It seems like I need to add If the answer is more than 24 then subtract 24. How to make that mathematical? I tried using >= symbol but that doesnt see to work. So if I write Return ...... Do you put the to_24_hour_clock on the next line? Sorry to be so slow...., Unresolved,0
