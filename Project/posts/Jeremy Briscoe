Thursday September 12th 2013 4:06 pm -04:00,Im having the same problem.This is what I get when I run my code which I believe is right though when I submit my code Im receiving a failure for invalid capital letter.  Any reason why Im marked wrong on this when my code is checking for all upper case letters?>>>is_valid_sequence()True>>> is_valid_sequence(ATCGGC)True>>> is_valid_sequence(atCTA)False>>> is_valid_sequence(ATBTA)False, Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 4:09 pm -04:00,I have tried this many different ways and am still receiving the same fail message even though my code works for me in all cases.  I dont know what the system is looking for so I dont know how I need to fix this.  Hopefully there will be an explanation after the due date so I know what I have done wrong.  Attached is what I get when I run the code:>>> is_valid_sequence(ATCGGC)True>>> is_valid_sequence(ATCTA)True>>> is_valid_sequence(atCTA)False>>> is_valid_sequence(ATBTA)False>>> is_valid_sequence()True>>> is_valid_sequence(AdefTBTA)FalseI cant help but to think that this is a flaw in the automatic grading process!!!student: test_a2.TestIsValidSequence.test_is_valid_sequence_invalid_capital_letter FAILURE [x]Method Description:Have you tested your function with an invalid capital letter?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorTrue is not false : Have you tested your function with an invalid capital letter?, Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 4:40 pm -04:00,To be fair I hadnt considered punctuation until the Yeah! comment and I realized where my code was incorrect.  That was what I was looking for through the discussion forum to begin.  The invalid_capital_letter error is vague.  I am still having trouble figuring out how to fix my code at the moment though Im sure that it will come to me., Resolved,0
