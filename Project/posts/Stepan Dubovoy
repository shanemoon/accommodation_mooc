Wednesday September 11th 2013 9:31 am -04:00,I got everything right on this step of the assignment but still struggling to understand how the function dealt with examples where we got negative times as a result of subtraction (addition). E.g. >>> time_from_utc(-7 6.0)23.06.0 + (-7) = -1Why -1 % 24 happens to be 23?May be I am missing some important concept about the mod operator. , Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 10:14 am -04:00,I think I got a hint here. The divident is supposed to be positive by definition. But...The result of the modulus operation on negatives seems to be programming language dependent and here is a listing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation . Then is this really the right way we were supposed to deal with the task? Or should we have somehow avoided getting negative hours before we convert them to a time on a 24 hour clock?, Resolved,0
