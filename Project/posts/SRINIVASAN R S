Sunday September 8th 2013 2:47 pm -04:00,i downloaded and installed pycharm and validated it with the licence key provided by Paul. But it says the licence will expire on 8th October 2013 against 31st October as said by Paul. Can anyone explain., Unresolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 1:48 am -04:00,thank you Tom.When Paul himself says that he and Jen will continue to use IDLE it goes without saying that every student must use it as well. I downloaded PyCharm just know what it is. I am pretty sure that I used the right username and licence key but now remember having ticked the option for 30 days trial.(At the same time I dont think the other option that was available in the validation window was suited for us). I assume  validation can be extended till 30th October after the 8th. i look forward to a day when I will really need pycharm as you said. thank you again., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 3:22 pm -04:00,One function in a1.py called to_24_hour_clock is complete.  Scroll down to it and see what it is doing.  The difference between it and the incomplete function definitions give a good hint about what is required to complete them.After completing Assignment1 successfully on my own when I went through the discussion forum to have an idea as to how others are doing I found the above point of yours. I rate it as the best. , Pinned Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 2:50 pm -04:00,Hi everybodyI had the same problem of Visualizer freezing with wait button. I tried everything above but could not fix it. Later when I checked the extensions list of my Google Chrome I found two extensions named hosts2 and Magnapic which I never remember to have installed myself. I still cannot figure-out how they came to be. But when I disabled them Visualizer started working. Hope this may help somebody., Resolved,1

On my desktop I have a text file called song.doc.Its full path is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\song.doc When I tried to assign this file to a variable called my_file for the purpose of opening it the word and in the file path is taken as the boolean operator and by Python and results in SyntaxError. The (:) character in the file path also results in SytaxError.How to overcome this problem? , Unresolved,1
