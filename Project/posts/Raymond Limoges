Saturday September 28th 2013 10:21 am -04:00,Dont feel down I am also experienced I even passed some Udacity python with high distinction but this assignment is something out in left field when it comes to the last 2 questions. One thing that helps is the visualizor. But your greatest asset is the almighty pencil write down each step of your code like the visualizor on paper. This will strengthten your knowledge of the material. DO NOT rely on forums!! We have come here to learn NOT let others do our homework. It might take a few extra minutes to do it on paper but those minutes will be the best time you ever spent. Keep in mind when you rely on yourself you will be better off later especially during the final exam where you cant rely on forums for answers!!!, Unresolved,0
