Wednesday September 4th 2013 2:51 pm -04:00,Hi Jason i shall try to explain it to you but with a slight reservation because i am a beginner in python.math_grade >= 50 or bio_grade >= 50 or cs_grade >= 50this expression (because of the boolean or operator) evaluates to True if each one of these 3 individual boolean expressions are True thought without being obligadory which means that could be True even if one of these 3 individual boolean expressions is True which could be interpreted by this sentence: The student passed at least one of the courses.The student passed all of the coursesThis sentence if i have understand correctly means that it is obligatory that all student passed all of the courses at the same time which could be interpreted by this boolean expression: math_grade >= 50 and bio_grade >= 50 and cs_grade >= 50.This boolean expression (because of the boolean and operator)  evaluates to True only if each one of these 3 individual expressions are True at the same time.The student passed some but not all of the courses.Assuming that students did not pass maths (math_grade < 50 which is True) this sentence could be interpreted by this boolean expression: math_grade < 50 or bio_grade >= 50 or cs_grade >= 50  or  math_grade < 50 and bio_grade >= 50 and cs_grade >= 50 which evaluates to True because all 3 individual boolean expression are True.i hope that helps you!!, Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 8:08 am -04:00, math_grade < 50 OR bio_grade >= 50 AND cs_grade >= 50 as far as ia have understood this expression could be also correct! Have you tested it in IDLE?, Resolved,0

Thursday September 5th 2013 8:11 am -04:00,Hi Bobbythis assignment semi =  semiperimeter (side1 side2 side3) which is the correct one is defined inside the body of the definition area_hero function which has 3 parameters (side1 side2 side3). For example when this line (area_hero(3 4 5)) is about to be ececuted the function evaluates the arguments 3 4 5 and assumes tha side1 = 3 side2 = 4 side3 = 5 and replace them to the right side of = of the assignment (semi =  semiperimeter (side1 side2 side3)) in order to execute the above predefined function semiparameter and assign the returning value to the variable semi.if you type semi = semiperimeter in IDLE you will see tha gives a Nameerror which would not leave  the ececution of function area_hero(3 4 5) to proceed. , Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 2:10 am -04:00,Hi Moid.i think your code is wrong because it is asked from us to return the number of positions in s1 that contain the same character at the corresponding position of s2. The key-word is corresponding position. It means that not only one char from the first list is also contained in the second list but must also be in the same position in both lists. In idle your code gives if one char rom the first list is also contained in the second list irrespetive of their positions in the lists.i hope i helped you!, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 10:21 am -04:00,However you can make the items move right changing slighly the existed code:def shift_right(L):    (List) -> NoneType    Shift each item in L one position to the right and shift the last item    to the first position.    Precondition: len(L) >=1        >>> shift_right([ab c d])    [a b c d]        last_item = L[-1]        for i in range((len(L)-1) 0 -1):        L[i] = L[i-1]            L[0] = last_item     return L, Resolved,0

I thought it should seemed as the example of the handout so in order to separate the words I put a newline character in each word by pressing the Enter button. When i called the read_word function it returned [CRUNCHY  COW S EAT  GRASS]After this i opened another .txt file and i wrote from the beginning each of the above words one per line and i saved it with anothe name. When i called the read_word function it returned the desirable result which is:  [CRUNCHY COW SEAT GRASS]Can anyone explain to me why did this happen?thanks in advance, Unresolved,0
