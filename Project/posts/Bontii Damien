Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:00 am -04:00,How do I really distinguish between Â Parameters and Arguments? I had a good understanding until I encountered a question on Week 1 Homework. I dont recollect the question very well but it had a function defined with one two as arguments and a body return one> two. This was followed by options as to whether two as a function name an argument or a parameter. This is where I got confused as to the difference between the parameter and the argument. I would appreciate any useful explanation from any student or even the course instructors. Thanks., Resolved,1

If you specify a certain value or string that must be returned when you call the function have you passed arguments or parametres to the function s body or to the function definition? , Resolved,0
