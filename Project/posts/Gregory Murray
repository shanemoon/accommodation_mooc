Monday September 2nd 2013 10:42 am -04:00,Ive completed the assignment and done the submissions but based on what I see in the results section Im uncertain if I followed the submission steps correctly or if the auto-tester is just backed up. The results displayedReport was generated in: 12:31:50 - 02/09/2013Summary: Test results statistics - All=42; Errors=42; Failures=0; Successes=0; Warnings=0. Duration: 0:00:00.086814 [H:M:S].with a raw score of 0/41 for each sectionI was reasonably certain my code is mostly correct all of the test examples worked.These are the steps I took to submit.1.  After step 2  submitted the code by uploading the modified a1.py file using the code submission button.2. After completing step 6 I uploaded a1_full.py using the additional submissions button.Ive not done a Coursera course before so i really didnt know what to expect when I submitted the assignment.  If some one could let me know if Ive made a mistake or if the problem is back log I would be grateful.  , Resolved,0
