Monday August 19th 2013 4:19 pm -04:00,How do i clear the screen in IDLE?  I am using python 3 idle on a mac., Resolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 9:50 pm -04:00,I had a hard time finding my config-extensions.def file on my mac.  It was here:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/lib/python3.3/idlelibAlso the command did not show up under options and CTRL-L was already used.  So I went to IDLE -> Preferences -> Keys.  Under the list of keys clear window was listed but no key combo was listed with it.  I selected clear window and pressed the Get New Keys Selection button.  Next I selected the Command option and the letter L.  I then was prompted to save this new key custom key set up and restarted IDLE.  Now when I hit Command - L the window is cleared and the prompt is on the top.  It works pretty well and is worth the hassle.  Thanks Remco and Eben., Resolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 8:33 pm -04:00,For Step 4 do we use the pre-condition that the argument passed is a valid character from the set {A T C G}?, Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:36 am -04:00,It actually says the first parameter is a nucleotide.  This does not necessarily mean the argument being passed is valid.  Can the instructions be more explicit about the pre-conditions?  , Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 4:38 pm -04:00,the + sign is an overloaded operator (an operator that has more than one task) for concatenating two strings.  Like adding them together more like joining them.  What would - do for strings?  Split?  That is a good intuition but I do not know of a programming language that uses the minus in this overloaded manner.  , Resolved,1
Thursday September 19th 2013 10:22 am -04:00,In python a list (or other collection) may be quickly constructed using a comprehension.  A simple list may be made using a comprehension without using a loop.  For instance L1 = [ x for x in range(10)]  #creates [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]L2 = [ x * 2 for x in range(10}]  #creates [0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18]L3 = [ x * 0.5 for x in range(10)]  #creates [0 .5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5]L4 = [x * x for x in range(10)] # creates [0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81], Unresolved,3
