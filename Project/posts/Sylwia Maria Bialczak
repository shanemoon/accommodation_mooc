Thursday August 22nd 2013 8:06 am -04:00,Hi allI have taken most of the week 1 lecture notes from the (i) pages and made a markdown file for myself. I might have missed some things but you are welcome to download it if you find it useful. I converted it to pdf and html if you prefer such formats. Here is a folder with the files: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3uJtmFrabgSYXl5VTJOMExyT1U&usp=sharingI will probably continue making .md (and other) files so you can keep the link. ,None,8

Thursday August 29th 2013 2:22 am -04:00,I am just starting with programming but have a lot of friends in the field working for the biggest and greatest or for the not so great. They all complain about the same thing. Requirements instructions old code. Take it as a great exercise of what real world looks like. People either do not care do not have time or their English is not good enough to write proper documentation or requirements for the code. Often the client has no idea what they want either., Unresolved,2
