Monday August 19th 2013 5:05 pm -04:00,I know the exact issue. System Preferences -> Security and Privacy -> General tab. Allow applications downloaded from: There are 3 options. The bottom option allows you to install programs from anyone. So this is a security thing so you have to be careful.,None,0

Tuesday August 27th 2013 9:59 pm -04:00,If you do not understand a question you should ask. Asking for clarification is a normal thing. And having to think about the problem is just going to help you as a programmer. I had one or two confusing moments but overall the questions in my opinion are both challenging and fair., Unresolved,4
Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:57 am -04:00,Maybe if you give us an example of which specific question(s) you are talking about that would help.d, Unresolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 10:26 am -04:00,A very good book to help with working through problems is Diane Zaks  An Introduction to Programming With C++. Yes it is C++ but the approach she takes is applicable many programming languages and good for anyone starting programming., Unresolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:55 am -04:00,Overall I have very happy with the questions they are challenging and fair. I do have one concern particularly because it means the difference between a correct answer and a wrong answer. I mentioned this is another post but after finishing the homework it really stood out.Going though the short quiz and Week 2 Exercise the nomenclature used for identifying variables for the type contract is simply not consistent and somewhat confusing. When I used number in the quiz it wanted int when I entered float in the homework it wanted number(to identify float or int according to the explanation). I just checked the handout/pdf and went through the transcript and watched the video again to see if I missed it.  To the best of my ability I did not. The pdf simply uses number. Please be consistent you are obviously using a program to correct all these tests and so there is no room for error. I am certain you are working very hard but as a student I find this very frustrating. And I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to learn from you. Thank you., Resolved,1
Thursday August 29th 2013 8:29 pm -04:00,OrionThat is a perfect explanation. You should have that added to the pdf file on the topic.Thank youderrick, Resolved,2
Saturday August 31st 2013 9:34 pm -04:00,If you are looking for a serious coding editor sublime text 2 or 3(beta). Not free but no time limit occasional nag screen. It was so good I purchased it. Works on linux mac and window., Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 9:48 pm -04:00,lol I knew that would come up but really for the most part I skipped it because learning vim is a course in itself. With sublime text anyone can run it right out of the box. And sublime text has plenty of power right out of the box. sublime text certainly blows notepad++ textwrangler out of the water easily. I used to use Textpad with windows I still kind of miss it but even that is not at the level of sublime text. One of my close buddies is a vim die hard so I have heard it all lol., Resolved,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 2:49 am -04:00,I kind of thought that my problem with it remains there is 1 full hour in 3800 seconds is wrong/   incorrect and is thus confusing. That may seem picky but that is it., Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 11:18 am -04:00,I removed the grammatically it is just incorrect., Resolved,-1
Sunday September 1st 2013 11:29 am -04:00,Dont worry I got it. We are are going to have to disagree. And no I do not agree with that logic. Taken as a single statement it is wrong. And quite frankly I dont need advice on paying attention. , Resolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 5:24 pm -04:00,It is very important to understand what is going on in the background. And understanding what is going on behind the scenes will help you greatly. In many languages they have a debugger it is similar to the visualizer in that it allows you to step through the program and see when variables are assigned and what their values are. Trust me this is only going to help you. When I am following the instructors using the visualizer I write the code out myself then use go to Python Visualizer and repeat what Jennifer or Paul are doing. Writing out the code is a perfect way to learn(just one of the ways)., Resolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 5:33 pm -04:00,VetonYou need to be specific. The instructors have added more instructions for assignment 1 both to the html and the actual python code file. As for your second statement you cannot learn programming without writing code., Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:05 pm -04:00,Yes that was strange I got the notification of your post and nothing., Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 8:31 pm -04:00,The functions for get_minutes and get_seconds do not return hours so that function is not applicable. Functions are perfect when you have to do some action repeatedly they also prevent one of the problems of bad programming repeating code., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 1:54 am -04:00,I installed idle but I use sublime and terminal. Pen and paper I thought that would be your approach. Congrats you must be a whiz. Text does not convey tone so for the record that was without sarcasm . , Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 2:37 am -04:00,On more complicated things I do the same write out the pseudocode.  I have been programming for a while and I should do it more often. Reading the forums there are a number of people who should take your lead and whip out the pen and paper and solve the problem in simple terms before they get lost in the code. I was a little surprised that the instructors never mentioned pseudocode., Resolved,1
