Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:10 am -04:00,Thats actually a tricky question to answer because Python keeps some common values in memory but recycles less-common ones.  Small integers (-5 to 256 I think?) are kept around or cached but everything else is recycled or garbage collected or garbage collected.  Some strings are also cached., Resolved,4

Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:26 am -04:00,This is advanced.  Please dont worry if youre completely lost with this post.  Youll understand most of it by the end of the course.In week 7 youre going to learn about dictionaries which allows you to define mappings between keys and values much like a regular dictionary maps words to definitions.  (This is directly relevant to the question in this thread!  Dont worry if it doesnt make complete sense yet; come back to this after week 7.)Here a is mapped to b and c is mapped to d:>>> a_dictionary = {a: b c: d}We can look up a value given a key:>>> a_dictionary[a]bThe reason this is relevant is because Python uses dictionaries to keep track of variables and their values. Every running function (and the Python shell itself) is given a dictionary to keep track of the values of its parameters and local variables.  You can access these various dictionaries using built-in function locals:>>> my_variable = abracadabra>>> locals(){__doc__: None __package__: None my_variable: abracadabra __name__: __main__ __builtins__: <module builtins (built-in)> __loader__: <class _frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter>}Notice the my_variable: abracadabra entry!  Python turns variables into strings and saves them in a dictionary.  And that is why variables are separate from their values in Python.For the rest of the entries anything starting and ending with 2 underscores is special to Python.  Notice the __builtins__: <module builtins (built-in)> entry -- thats how Python accesses the built-in functions., Approved Resolved,7

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 8:35 pm -04:00,What is the expected range of the return value for get_seconds and what range are you getting when you call to_24_hour_clock?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 7:45 am -04:00,No need to apologize!The description in the handout for get_seconds says this:                            The parameter is a number of seconds since midnight. Return the number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight as seen on a clock. (This means that the return value should be in the range 0 to 59 inclusive.)Your                code instead returns a number in the range 0-23 because youre calling function to_24_hour_clock which converts a number of hours to a time on a 24 hour clock (it uses % 24 to do this).                Is that a good enough hint?  Im happy to keep going!                        , Unresolved,1

Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:44 pm -04:00,Two reasons (that I can think of).1) Because we want people to work mostly as a cohort.  Weve got some very helpful folks who have come out of the woodwork to help each other and I dont think that would happen if people worked at their own pace.2) The more practical reason: were editing the material as we go cleaning up sound removing our stuttering and misspeaks making the summaries better and so on.  Were just barely ahead of the material., Unresolved,16

Monday September 23rd 2013 3:41 pm -04:00,These two concepts are quite different:Some objects such as lists are mutable.Variables can be reassigned. Reassigning a variable as you do in the code above makes that variable point to a different object.  That is different than changing the contents of the object that a variable points to.Does that difference make sense?, Resolved,1

Monday September 23rd 2013 3:48 pm -04:00,Why do I have a DisabledBuiltinError?  Youre probably trying to call the open function from your code. Notice that none of the function docstrings say that any of the arguments passed in to any of the functions are file names. The type contracts list arguments as being of type file open for reading not str as would the case if we wanted you to open any files. Instead when testing your code you should open the file in the shell and call your functions passing in that opened file., Pinned Resolved Locked,3
