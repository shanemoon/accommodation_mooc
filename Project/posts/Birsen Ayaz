Monday September 2nd 2013 11:24 am -04:00,I have a stupid question. I am trying to use two windows in the shell so I can see both windows (the script and command line shell). But when I click one the other one disappears so I have to go back and forth. What commend do you use to keep them together?  ( I am a mac user)thanks, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 3:29 pm -04:00,My code works perfectly if I use print ((get_complement(seq) end= ) in get_complementary_sequence(sequence) function  but not with       return get_complement(seq). When I use return it only returns the first complementary character in the string. Is  there is a way to do it?Thanks in advanceBirsen, Unresolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 3:57 pm -04:00,the end =  puts the characcters  next to each other instead of in the next line. The end =  does not work in return., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 6:06 pm -04:00,I have the same issue. My code works perfectly on my shell but when I submit it issues 3 errors (so I get 21/24) as follows in get_complimentary_sequence function:1) did you test with empty string2) did you test with handout example3) did you test with long sequenceAnd YES I tested and it works (on my shell)>>> get_complimentary_sequence(ATGCCTG)TACGGAC>>> get_complimentary_sequence(AT)TA>>> get_complimentary_sequence()And here is my get_complimentary_sequence function:=========================    comSeq =     for  char in dnaSeq:        if char in dnaSeq:            comSeq = comSeq + get_complement(char)    return comSeq=================================Anyone knows what is going on?ThanksBirsen, Unresolved,0
