Wednesday October 2nd 2013 4:33 am -04:00,read_board functionCould someone please explain to me what exactly list(string) does. I have used it in this project which In have completed successfully but still dont get it. If I exclude list from my function(listname .append(line) )  a list of the lines is returned eg [EFJAJCOWSS SDGKSRFDFF etc]. When I qualify the instruction with list(listname.append(list(line)) ) I get the correct return [[E F J A J C O W S S]    [S D G K S R F D F F] etc] i.e. a list of list of the letters of the string. What I dont understand is why from one list of strings multiple lists of components of the strings is formed.I know I am being thick but please indulge me with an explanation , Unresolved,0
