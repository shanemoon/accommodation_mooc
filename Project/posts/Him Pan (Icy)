Based on the given solution for the body from http://pragprog.com/wikis/wiki/PracProg2functions the answer on my phyton shell version 3.3.2 returns a negative number instead of positive number as provided in the above link. Please clarify thanks.2. despite the fact that in the description of the question has indicated that it is an int I have tried to use abs instead in the body (i.e. return abs((d1-d2)/7) and it returns a floating number instead. example: >>>d(320)2.4285714285714284I thought absolute number means whole number am I correct?3. Am I right to say that it is only correct to write a return statement in the body with the corresponding contract type mentioned in the description?example from Q8... (int int)->intin the body we should return an int as a result:i.e. return int(...)in reference to the above could you please let me know whether my understanding is correct given my own example:... (float)->floatn the body we should return a float as a result:i.e. return float(...)note that the three dots in the bracket represents the arguments.Appreciate if you could give me a hand.Thanks & Kind regards,None,0

Saturday August 31st 2013 12:37 am -04:00,Thank you all for your wonderful inputs.

This cost me a few hours to figure out by removing the incorrect and commented out statement return x%100 from the program.Please help and give me some clue thank you!def fun(x):	(int) -> int	return an int	return x%100	return x//100, Resolved,0

Is it correct to say that the <= (less or equal sign) can be also referred to as the priority of ordering in the case of A <= B returns True? Meaning that <= could also represent the ascending order of alphabets therefore A goes first and B goes after is a true statement.2. How about A < a returns true? Does that mean capital letters goes after the lower case letters?3. Why  < 3 returns true? what is the logic for this one?4. What is the reason for limes in smiles returns false?
