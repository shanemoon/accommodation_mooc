It gets into arrays and how to work with large chunks of data. So think about stock quotes census data that sort of thing.Also the book itself goes into the basics of how to use an IPython notebook.

And an IDE is just a fancy word for a fancy text editor that does more than just typing out Python code i.e. it has a spell-checker allows you to run various tests create projects and on and on. WingIDE though is just one of several Python IDEs out there.And as Rowell mentioned stick with IDLE since you wont really need a fancy IDE for this course anyway.

Monday August 19th 2013 11:16 am -04:00,There are several reasons for doing it that way. But one of the main reasons as has been already suggested has to do with memory allocation.But think of it this way. Imagine that you have 10 different variables i.e. a b c d etc. And they all contain the exact same number 2. Which is more efficient? Using 10 separate locations in memory to store 10 copies of the exact same number 2. Or using just one memory location to store the number 2 and have the variables point to that location instead., Approved Resolved,12
Monday August 19th 2013 12:38 pm -04:00,I dont think its unique to Python. Im pretty sure there are other languages out there that use the same method.But I do know that a fair amount of other languages dont do it that way at all. Which is why it does cause some confusion when certain programmers are coming from another language. Theyre still thinking that each variable is like a totally separate box that you put stuff in. But of course its not like that at all.For example once you start making one variable being equal to another variable strange things start to happen. You change one variable and the other variable may or may not change as well all depending on the data type i.e. if the object is mutable or immutable. That sort of thing can be confusing but its not that confusing., Approved Resolved,2
Tuesday August 20th 2013 2:43 am -04:00,Theres always a lot of confusion when it comes to Python and its data typing mainly due to the exact nature of what weve just been discussing i.e. variables pointing to values. But Python is not a loosely or weakly-typed language its actually a strongly-typed language.So for example a string in Python is a string and an integer is an integer. You cant add different data types together like you would in JavaScript for example. Thats the difference between a strongly-typed and weakly-typed language.Python is also a dynamically-typed language as opposed to statically-typed. Amongst other things this refers to the variables themselves. It makes sense that Python is considered as dynamically-typed since any variable could be pointing to an integer in one line of code and the exact same variable be pointing to a string in the next. Thats the difference between dynamically-typed and statically-typed.And as Ivan mentioned in Python it`s not really a good idea to state data types in variable names. Unless it`s for educational purposes and so on. But you can actually see what one of the reasons would be for not using such names from my example above in that a variable could be pointing to an integer in one instance and then suddenly be pointing to a string in the next line of code. Hence the variable name `intAge` could actually be misleading in that it`s now a string., Approved Resolved,5
Monday August 19th 2013 1:07 pm -04:00,Theoretically the point system is suppose to bring attention to really interesting threads etc. So if you see a thread with 50 up-votes then its probably something thats worth reading. And vice-versa.Also its a way for the instructors to filter out issues that students may be having. And to filter out the hundreds if not thousands of threads that are going to be generated throughout the course.

Theres no master rule or suggestion on how to do things but in Python the so-called authoritative document which provides guidance is known as PEP 8 which stands for Python Enhancement Proposal number 8:http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/So the rule of thumb is that you should have a space before and after an operator i.e. before and after the +.

Tuesday August 20th 2013 11:49 pm -04:00,Abhishek what you mentioned about programming concepts is so true.A lot of people who are new to programming always think that if I just learn a certain language i.e. the syntax then Ill know how to do stuff. But its actually the complete opposite. Learning the syntax of a language is always the easy part. Its the programming concepts that are the hardest to learn yet the most important. And Python is a great language to learn those concepts.So for people new to programming as you progress with Python and learn how to work with functions methods objects etc. one thing youll notice is that eventually youll be able to look at other languages such as JavaScript C# etc. and actually understand whats going on without even having taken a single course related to those languages. Thats the power of programming concepts.,None,14
Wednesday August 21st 2013 12:30 pm -04:00,Nikhil when I was referring to programming concepts it wasnt necessarily about mathematical concepts. It really was about programming concepts such as abstraction encapsulation working with objects and so on.For example I see that youre signed up for the Interactive Programming course in October. Not quite sure if you know anything about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? But in that course youll use Python to create objects from a class and interact with those objects through methods. Those are very much programming concepts.So once you understand how objects work in Python then as I mentioned above youll pretty much understand how they work in other languages as well. Youll be amazed at how youll be able to read and understand JavaScript or C# for example without even having taken a single course on those languages LOL.As for the right way to learn?

Tuesday August 20th 2013 4:27 am -04:00,You have to remember that in Python it`s not the variable that gets stored in memory but the values themselves. So if you then say x = 3 what will happen is you now just created a third object i.e. the integer 3 and it`ll go into a third memory location.In terms of the garbage collector it`ll eventually figure out that the first two objects ie. integers 1 & 2 no longer have the variable x pointing to them. Or any other variable for that matter. But it may or may not destroy them right away i.e. releasing the memory location. I know we`ll get much deeper into how things actually work later on during the course though especially when we get to namespaces functions etc., Resolved,2

Friday September 6th 2013 6:12 am -04:00,Heres another way to think about it. Technically everything is a parameter its just that the arguments are the actual parameters.The word itself parameter means to measure or more specifically a side or subsidiary measurement. So thinking about an airplane for example what are some of the so-called parameters or things that we can measure? It could be expressed as follows: def airplane(speed altitude heading etc.)  Now what are the actual parameters or actual measurements which we call arguments?

Tuesday August 27th 2013 1:52 am -04:00,One thing to keep in mind in terms of functions is that something will ALWAYS be returned. Its not a question of whats the difference between print and return. Something will always be returned regardless if you print to the console or not.A function is like a blackbox. You may not know its inner workings. Or how exactly it does its stuff. Or even care. But if you put something into a function well guess what something will ALWAYS come out.Now you may not actually notice it in Python that something is being returned but if you dont specify a return statement then a so-called hidden return statement will be inserted for you. And that so-called return is called None. Which is basically equivalent to nothing but its still something.So the following two functions are exactly the same thing: >>> def f(x):	print(x * 2)>>> def f(x):	print(x * 2)	return None  Check out this code to see whats happening... >>> print(f(5))10None>>> x = f(5)10>>> type(x)<class NoneType> Notice in the first example that the function does its thing prints 10 but then returns None even though there was no return statement. You only notice that None was returned if you actually print it out to the console.So dont get confused with what a function actually does. It can print to the console update a variable turn your screen blue or whatever. But it will always return something. Either you can specify it explicitly in terms of what a function will return. Or if not then Python will actually do it for you implicitly by returning None.,None,4
Sunday August 25th 2013 11:04 pm -04:00,I think Michael explained it the best. In terms of Python its only when you really really need to know that two variables are actually pointing to the same location. Or that its True in some sort of Boolean logic.Thank God though that in Python we dont have to worry about such things. And that we can just let the so-called Garbage Collector handle anything related to memory.Unless youre actually working for NASA or something. Wouldnt want planet Earth to get hit by an asteroid simply because someone didnt know what they were doing in terms of memory addresses LOL. :-), Resolved,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 10:04 pm -04:00,Just to add to what was already mentioned the so-called Built-ins go beyond just functions.The term built-in refers to the built-in modules which are part of the Standard Library. Also of interest is that these modules are written in a language called C which speeds everything up. You program in Python but under the hood everything runs in C.And within those modules you not only have Built-in Functions but you also have Built-in Constants Built-in Types Built-in Exceptions etc.http://docs.python.org/3.2/library/So think of the Built-in Types i.e. the numeric types that we learned this week such as int and float. Those are Built-in Types which are part of the Standard Library.What if you wanted to do some heavy-duty mathematics that went beyond the simple Built-in Types of int and float? Well no problem you just import some sort of special module that has been specially created to do those heavy-mathematics. The NumPy package or module is a perfect example.So quick and dirty rule if you see a so-called import statement such as the one below then you know youre no longer just using the Built-in Types Functions Constants or Exceptions from the Standard Library anymore. import numpy as np   , Unresolved,1

Wednesday August 28th 2013 10:15 am -04:00,Theres an easy way to think about modulo and thats to use the clock system. Its used fairly often in games etc. such as rock-paper-scissors when you dont want to write a whole bunch of complex code in terms of who beat who. So you simply represent everything onto a clock and move clockwise or counter-clockwise from the top.For example -1 % 24 is very easy. Thats a 24-hour clock move counter-clockwise by 1 since its negative 1 and where does the dial-hand point to? 23 obviously.How about  3 % 24? Again move clockwise this time because 3 is positive and the dial-hand ends up at 3. Both these examples are known as positive clocks because the 24 is positive.A little more complicated but still the same principle are negative clocks. For example 3 % -24 is considered a negative clock because 24 is negative. Which means we do the opposite of clockwise and counter-clockwise. So in this example we move counter-clockwise by 3 and end up at 21 but its a negative 21 because its a negative clock.Hope its not too confusing but once you understand the clock system its very easy.P.S. Lets try the -134 % 24 that was mentioned above. Thats a positive clock which means we move counter-clockwise 134 times. Which is equivalent to 5 complete rotations and 14 left over. Or -14 % 24. So move counter-clockwise 14 times and where does the dial-hand point to? 10 obviously., Resolved,3
Wednesday August 28th 2013 10:26 am -04:00,Heres another example to try out using the clock system. Two negative numbers! :)-3 % -24Is that a positive or negative clock? And which way do we go? Clockwise or counter-clockwise?, Resolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 5:03 pm -04:00,Yes the answer is correct its -3. And your reasoning for going clockwise by 3 because its both a negative clock and negative 3 is also correct.The only thing is your diagram of the clock. The layout of a normal clock doesnt change so 3 would still be on the right 9 on the left etc. Otherwise it can get really confusing., Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 5:49 pm -04:00,Thinking about it some more...Yes I guess you could flip the clock in terms of a normal clock layout if it was negative. So if it was a negative clock then you simply flip it. This way you could keep the counter-clockwise motion of -3 and still arrive at an answer of 3 or -3 to be more precise since its a negative clock.Not a bad way to think about either. It all depends on what works for you., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 4th 2013 12:35 am -04:00,Id just like to add that its an excellent way of getting things done. And the idea that you start with the end result first and then work your way backwards is used in a lot of other domains as well.So for example in the military they call it a time estimate as opposed to a design recipe. But its the same idea. You start with the end result i.e. a so-called h-hour in which you start the battle and work your way backwards in terms of everything else that has to happen beforehand.Try it for your next vacation for example using the Function Design Recipe.

Wednesday August 28th 2013 7:52 am -04:00,One thing that hasnt been mentioned yet is the use of Unicode. It extends the use of the alphabet and the ability to use symbols etc. Python has built-in support for Unicode.So you may also see strings that look like this:  >>> ucafécaféOR>>> ucaféucafé  Always interesting are the Greek and Chinese letters as well:  >>> u\u65e6\u673c旦朼>>> {GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA}Δ>>> \u0394Δ>>> \U00000394Δ    For people interested you can read all about the history and use of Unicode in Python:Unicode HOWTOhttp://docs.python.org/3.3/howto/unicode.html, Resolved,2
Wednesday August 28th 2013 8:40 am -04:00,Another interesting aspect is how Python will store variables and their values. This was mentioned in another thread by Professor Paul Gries and is considered advanced stuff for now.But Python will convert the names of variables into strings in order to store them in a dictionary. Dont worry if you dont know about dictionaries yet itll be covered later on in the course. Its just a Key:Value pair like a real dictionary. The Key is the variable and the Value is the value of the variable.Notice below how variables are stored. Theyre all strings. Notice int and float remain the same. Double-quotes get turned into single-quotes except if you use both of them. And Unicode characters are actually characters but that may depend on your system.So yes technically variables are strings. :-)  >>> my_variable_1 = 2.3456>>> my_variable_2 = 23456>>> my_variable_3 = this is a string>>> my_variable_4 = \u65e6>>> my_variable_5 = this is Daves string>>> locals(){__name__: __main__ __builtins__: <module builtins> my_variable_2: 23456 my_variable_3: this is a string __doc__: None __package__: None __loader__: <class _frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter> my_variable_1: 2.3456 my_variable_4: 旦 my_variable_5: this is Daves string}, Resolved,1
Thursday August 29th 2013 11:26 pm -04:00,I dont think there is a way to clear the screen in IDLE? I know its one of those feature requests that a lot of people have been asking for i.e. just a simple CLS command.Some people have suggested creating a function that prints like a hundred blank lines and then just calling it. But thats obviously a lot of trouble for example... >>> def cls(): print( * 100)>>> cls()  The following seems to work in a regular command line terminal. But obviously no good for IDLE itself...  >>> import os>>> os.system(clear)1>>> os.system(CLS)0  Not quite sure why something like that in IDLE isnt quite standard yet?

Wednesday September 4th 2013 3:44 pm -04:00,Yeray best way to approach this question is to break it down into two steps... First look at the input i.e. the arguments such as moose and scratch. Yes those are words but there is no such thing as a data type of word. We learned earlier that anything in quotes is a string so obviously those inputs are of the data type str.Second look at the output i.e. the returned values of 3 and 1. Yes those are numbers but what type of numbers are they? You could say the Type Contract is (str) -> number. But is that really accurate? Are 3 and 1 of the data type float int or possibly both? Theres no decimal points so we know theyre not floats.Therefore theres only one possibility. The Type Contract has to be (str) -> int., Resolved,5

Wednesday September 4th 2013 1:32 am -04:00,Ive done or participated in about a dozen different MOOCs over the past couple of years. And one thing that I can say which is very consistent among all of them is the low-balling of course workloads.A typical 6-8 hours per week usually means that you have some sort of prior experience with the subject material that when you go through the various videos you watch them just one time that when you attempt the various quizzes exercises and assignments that all goes well pretty much on the first try.Also means that you dont really participate in the discussion forums either. Any sort of reading analyzing responding and offering up suggestions in various threads can be quite consuming in terms of time as well. Which should also be factored in since a great deal of learning does come from the discussion forums.So I know for myself whos not a Python newbie and already knows most of this stuff. Spending about 6-8 hours a week sounds about right. But for total newbies its probably more like 12-15 hours a week. And maybe even more if you really dont get this stuff.But I wouldnt give up. Its just a question of time allocation. My advice would be to not try and do everything in one shot. Even if you do spurts of 15-20 minutes every now and then itll help quite a lot. And if youre really time constrained then just focus on the videos and the quizzes themselves. You can always re-take the course later on but will at least have some sort of prior experience.Good luck!,None,5

Sunday September 8th 2013 11:47 pm -04:00,Another solution if youre really stuck is to quickly put together a module of the three functions and just run it in IDLE i.e. create a file called word.py for example. It could be that you know what youre doing but its just that your syntax is wrong.So youd create something like this Run the module and then call the count_letters() function from the Python Shell in IDLE to see if your syntax is correct. Obviously you would have to fill in the dots with the appropriate parameters etc.  def count_vowels(...):    return ...def count_consonants(...):    return ...def count_letters(word):    return ...>>> ================================ RESTART ================================>>> >>> count_letters(lynn)...>>> Hope this helps as well.Edit: These are dummy functions obviously that dont really count the vowels and consonants. But are just to check your syntax., Resolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 12:07 am -04:00,Im sure youve run a module before. A module is just a Python file such as word.py So in the above example I started IDLE then File -> New Window. In that new window I typed out the code for the three functions and saved it as word.py Then you select Run -> Run Module from the menu bar which will make the functions available in the Python Shell. Just a matter of calling the count_letters() function after that., Resolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 12:17 am -04:00,Running a module is before week 3. But its possible that you just havent tried it out yet i.e. tried to run some of the examples from the video lectures. Its kind of important though.The shell is just the place where you type your code but your code will disappear after you close IDLE. So if you want to save your code then you would save it in a .py file i.e. a module. And then Run it later., Resolved,0

Monday September 9th 2013 7:03 pm -04:00,Nick I know what you mean in terms of 11:59 and 12:00. Ive been on a few courses where people thought they had an extra day due to the time zones when in fact the deadline was minutes away i.e. due on Tuesday but its a Monday in local time.I dont think anyone is complaining in this thread anyways of not knowing the deadlines. It literally is a last-minute thing. But to the credit of the professors on this course I dont think they could have made it any simpler. Here are some of the things they did: they standardized all the deadlines so that everything is due on a Monday at noon (ET).theyve removed the penalties if you go beyond the soft deadline i.e. you get an extra week.  Which means you actually get a full two weeks instead of one week without penalty. Not counting the 11:59 bug of course. ;-)Ive been on some courses where there was two different deadlines per week i.e. Monday & Saturday. Plus two more if you considered the whole soft/hard deadline issue where your score would lose a certain percentage each day that you were late gradually getting to zero as the hard deadline approached.Plus assignments or projects that had their own deadlines and then another deadline to submit the actual peer assessment which was a certain number of days after that one.LOL just crazy., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 4th 2013 2:57 am -04:00,The terminal is a very basic way to interact with your computer. You can use the terminal to run Python or any other program for that matter. But basically all you can do with a terminal is to type in commands. Theres no menu bar graphics you cant use your mouse or anything like that. Anyways thats what a terminal is suppose to be just like it was in the 1950s. But a modern day terminal is now just a pop-up window that tries to look and act like a terminal i.e. a so-called terminal emulator.IDLE though is just for Python. You cant type commands to run a spreadsheet for example. Its also a GUI (graphical user interface) that makes it easier to interact with your computer in that it has a menu bar you can use your mouse etc. You can type in the same sort of commands as a terminal if youre running Python but it also has many other features. IDLE is also called an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in that it doesnt just run code but can also debug your code run tests etc.As to why you have two different versions of Python i.e. 2.6.1 and 3.3.2 thats probably because your Apple operating system came with a pre-installed version of Python. And when you launch the terminal it points to the 2.6.1 version. No doubt you must have installed Python 3 on your system as well? So no doubt IDLE is configured that run that version. Im not an Apple user but you could probably configure the terminal to use Python 3 as well if you really wanted to.But as you probably know for this course were using Python 3 which does have some differences from version 2.,None,0

Wednesday September 4th 2013 4:40 pm -04:00,Theres no problem with the lecture summary its just fine. The only thing wrong is the typo which Etienne mentioned in that one decimal points should be one decimal point without the s.When it refers to one decimal point it literally means just one decimal point and NOT the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. So float (-43.21) is perfectly valid. And so is float (-43.215)etc.Having float (-43.2.1) will generate a ValueError since it actually has more than one decimal point.Thats what is meant.As for the int function theres no mention of one decimal point two decimal point etc. because as soon as you have anything other than a digit ie. a string with a decimal point then it will generate a ValueError.And that is mentioned in the summary i.e. int(-99.9) will generate a ValueError because its not all digits.Hope this explains what is meant by decimal points., Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 4:26 am -04:00,My advice would be to not try to memorize the terminology. Much better to understand the meaning instead if you ask me. Its like trying to memorize a physics formula which can be extremely hard. And youre no further ahead if you ever have to use it. Much better to understand what the formula is saying in the first place.Usually the terminology is just plain English and will immediately jump out at you if you look closely enough. Heres some basic examples and ways to think about what weve learned so far...Variables are things that vary. Again its just plain English.Arguments are constantly changing. Think of an actual argument i.e. one with your spouse or girlfriend. Everyone has a different argument and it could be anything.Expressions are things that people utter or say. In Python an expression is something that you as the programmer wont say but would type out as text instead.Expressions get evaluated just like in real life. If someone expresses a certain feeling towards me then the first thing Im going to do is try to figure out or evaluate what they just said.Evaluate is just a process that literally means what it means i.e. youll get some sort of value.Frames are exactly like picture frames. You know those square things you hang on the wall. Frames are a diagram with four lines one for each side and they have something inside.Stacks are exactly like whatever stack you can think of. In Python we stack a bunch of frames on top of one another. Thats all a stack is. If you dont believe me then just look at a picture of a call stack i.e. its just a diagram of 4-sided boxes (frames) stacked on top of each other.  So if you look closely at all this so-called terminology youll soon notice that a lot of it is just plain English. And that you probably already know the meaning of these words. And that theres usually no real need to memorize or look up anything., Resolved,2

Not sure if were going to learn that technique later on but a function calling itself is known as recursion. So you could have something like this:  def get_hours(seconds):    # body of code here    return get_hours(seconds)  The real problem is as the error message states. Theres two types and the existing code is trying to divide one type by another type. In this case were trying to divide the function itself get_hours by the integer 2. Point to note is that theres no parentheses after get_hours so its not a call to the function but really the function itself.So logically dividing a function by 2 just doesnt make sense hence the TypeError., Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 11:11 am -04:00,Just like to mention that Whitmans error message is really great in terms of learning how to read errors..  TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for //: function and int  First its a TypeError which means theres some sort of conflict between one or more types i.e. a string an integer etc. In this case the conflict is between a function and an int the two so-called operands.Second we have operands but whats the operator you know the symbol that separates the two? In this case the error message says the operator is // which is the integer division symbol.So when we think about it we dont even really need to look at the code to figure out whats wrong. This is a case of trying to divide a function by an integer. Not the results of a function divided by an integer. But trying to divide the actual function itself. Now obviously that doesnt make any sense hence the error message.All very interesting. :-), Resolved,0

Friday September 6th 2013 10:08 am -04:00,Theres a couple of things going on...First this is known as lazy evaluation. Which means that depending on the variables and the operator Python may only evaluate the first value and stop. Or it may be continue to the end.Second all values that are non-zero etc. are interpreted as True i.e. both cents and dollars are considered as True since theyre not zero etc.So if you use the AND operator it will keep evaluating all the values until the end and only return the last one. If you were to use the OR operator for example then Python would stop at cents since its True and would not need to check anything else.Some code in action...  >>> dollars = 18>>> cents = 53>>> pesos = 0>>> cents and dollars18>>> cents or dollars53>>> cents and pesos and dollars0>>> cents or pesos or dollars53>>> pesos or cents or dollars53, Resolved,2

Friday September 6th 2013 2:21 pm -04:00,Mastering a language would be quite a feat and an accomplishment thats for sure. I dont think anyone has truly mastered a language? Okay maybe a select few but these are the elite programmers. No doubt though they are still learning new things everyday.In terms of going from Python to another language I would say anyone who finishes this course and follows-up with some object-oriented programming (OOP) could easily learn another language very quickly. Its always the concepts that are the hardest to learn not the syntax of a language.In fact I would even say that you could look at a C# program for example or JavaScript without any prior experience. And actually understand whats going on. It would just be a matter of understanding the syntax but the functions would be the same. And if you know OOP then you would immediately recognize the various classes methods etc. and how everything is put together.In terms of learning more than one language I think theres two schools of thought out there...First school of thought says to learn a bit of one language and get exposed to many other languages that will in turn help you develop a greater understanding of what you already know. This can be quite time consuming but the idea is that the sum is greater than the parts. You may not know everything but youve mastered the basics.Second school of thought says to focus on one language only. Pick a horse and stick with it. The benefit of focus is that youll be able to move beyond the basics and get into higher-level concepts that you would not normally have time for if you had tried to learn other languages as well. Knowing quite a lot and being fairly proficient is a plus. But the downside would be the lack of a greater understanding that comes from those other languages.I know for me personally I still havent figured it out. Everything is still a constant battle LOL.,None,2

Dan Grossmans Programming Languages course goes from one language to the next. And he actually stipulates will teach you how the pieces of a language fit together to create more than the sum of the parts LOL.The Interactive Python course at Rice University is very much the second school of thought. Youve picked a horse and its Python. Its suppose to be an introductory course but theyll bring you up to a higher-level by doing object-oriented programming working with a graphical user interface and so-called event-driven programming. Its not to say that this isnt applicable to other languages quite the contrary but its still focused on Python.Either way both those courses are still pretty tough.

Thats the whole purpose of these if and elif statements. If the first if is False then it continues down the line i.e. there could be an infinite number of elifs until it finds one thats True. Of course if nothing is True then nothing gets executed.Also theres no function to initiate in those lines of code. Are you thinking these if/elif statements are some sort of function? The only function is the print() function.And notice how Option 1 & 2 are exactly the same except for the redundant code in Option 1.

Monday September 9th 2013 1:00 pm -04:00,Alan wow not quite sure why you think that you cant learn mathematics by programming? The links that Allen Harper provided below are a perfect example of exactly that. Allen B. Downey is renowned for teaching Bayesian methods for example through programming and Python itself.As for the real mathematics you described above. Thats pure mathematical thinking which lays the foundation for all other higher-level mathematics. And it lends itself quite well to learning through programming since its pure logic without the philosophicalaspects.For example set theory logic relationships equivalence implication and proofs can all be done through Python. In fact one of the data structures within Python is sets. And implications like  p => q i.e. p implies q can be expressed as not(p) or q. Thats basic Truth Table stuff.As for todays theoretical physicists all their work is based on computer models and the writing of programs.

Not sure if youve learned how to work with implications yet?But youre going to love this. You were wondering if programming could actually help me learn Math. So lets use some programming and Python itself to do some mathematical thinking.Here we go...Implication is about if/then statements i.e. p implies q or p => q or not(p) or q using logical operators. In plain English its implied that if I learn programming then Ill learn mathematics. So if its True thatI learned programming and its True that I learned mathematics then the implication is True i.e. p => q  is True. In Python it looks like this...  >>> p q = True True>>> not(p) or qTrue If its True that I learned programming and its False that I learned mathematics then the implication is False i.e. p => q  is False. Which makes sense...  >>> p q = True False>>> not(p) or qFalse  If its False that I learned programming and its True that I learned mathematics then the implication is True i.e. p => q  is True. This one is harder to understand but it still makes sense. If I dont learn programming then Im still free to do whatever I want in terms of mathematics. It was never implied that If I didnt learn programming that I couldnt learn mathematics.  >>> p q = False True>>> not(p) or qTrue  If its False that I learned programming and its False that I learned mathematics then the implication is True i.e. p => q  is True. Last one...  >>> p q = False False>>> not(p) or qTrue  Learning Math through programming in action. :-),None,2

Sunday September 8th 2013 10:37 pm -04:00,Vijay I understand what yourre saying and the answer is definitely yes. In terms of Python one of the best tools to do math is to use an IPython notebook:http://ipython.org/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPythonIts very similar to something like Mathematica or Maple but youre doing as you suggest math and coding skills at the same time. The IPython project was started in 2001 by Fernando Perez whos a research scientist at the University of California (Berkeley) and has sort of exploded in recent years. Hes well known in the Python community:https://plus.google.com/105051551851350439748/postshttp://fperez.org/The idea is to experiment with small snippets of code i.e. do math through programming and see what you get through inline plots graphs that sort of thing. You can also take notes and save all your work in a so-called notebook. Heres some examples:http://ipython.org/_static/sloangrant/9_home_fperez_prof_grants_1207-sloan-ipython_proposal_fig_ipython-notebook-specgram.pnghttp://nbviewer.ipython.org/I know personally thats what Ive been trying to do lately combine my mathematical learning and coding together through Python.,None,2

Monday September 9th 2013 2:44 am -04:00,I think the premise is that you dont really want modules printing to the console every time a function is called unless thats what you really want. So think of a complete program with hundreds of function calls and perhaps dozens of modules. That program may not even use the console at all i.e. it may use a graphical user interface (GUI) instead.The shell is different. Its meant to be interactive where you get some sort of feedback. Either for running small snippets of code debugging or whatever.Thats probably the most obvious reason if you ask me?, Unresolved,0

Also if you type True into IDLE youll notice it turns into an orange colour. Same thing for False. Anything that is orange is a special type of word that is known as a keyword.And if you actually want to see a list of keywords just type the following in IDLE...  >>> import keyword>>> keyword.kwlist[False None True and as assert break class continue def del elif else except finally for from global if import in is lambda nonlocal not or pass raise return try while with yield]>>> , Resolved,2

Monday September 9th 2013 10:35 pm -04:00,Tim explained the recursive process and notation fairly well. But you can also just look at the code and visually step through it to figure out whats going on.As Tim mentioned the argument is an index or the position in the Fibonacci sequence. So index 0 is the first number index 1 is the second number i.e. fib(7) will return 13 which is the 8th number in the sequence.First index is easy fib(0) will hit the if statement and return 0 end of function call. Second is also easy fib(1) jumps past the if statement will hit the elif and return 1 end of function call.Third index fib(2) starts to get interesting. Itll hit the else statement and this is where recursion starts. We know n = 2 but we actually have two function calls in the else statement. No problem one gets called and does it thing then the second one gets called and does its thing. Then the returns of those two get added together and the whole thing is returned.So when n = 2 we get a function call of fib(2-1) or fib(1) which returns 1. And a function call of fib(2-2) or fib(0) which returns 0. Which in turn returns 1 + 0 which is 1. Does fib(2) or the index 2 of the Fibonacci sequence equal to 1? The answer is yes.In terms of recursion dont think about a function calling itself. Just think of it as the first function calling another function which just happens to have the exact same code.Using the Python Visualizer you can see the frames being stacked on top of each other every time the function gets called. Its very obvious when you use higher index numbers. Initially itll create a stack of frames and then work backwards returning values to the previous frame: http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=def+fib(n)%3A%0A++++if+n+%3D%3D+0%3A%0A++++++++return+0%0... Notice the number of steps. As you go higher its not just an increase in steps but an exponential increase in the number of steps. Simply because you have function calls in function calls which in turn create even more function calls.The only thing you may not notice is that once a frame returns a value to the previous frame itll disappear and a new one will be created. But thats hard to tell because guess what the function calls all have the same name. :-),None,0

Thursday September 12th 2013 10:26 am -04:00,No doubt this course and the Interactive Python course will help you quite a lot in terms of game development. In the Interactive Python course they really get into OOP.For example youll build a Blackjack game with a card class and then create 52 instances of that class i.e. a deck of 52 cards. The deck the players hand the dealers hand etc. are all objects. So the cards being individual objects get moved from one object to another i.e. from the deck to the players hand. Very good introduction to OOP.Grasping how objects work is always the hardest part. It shouldnt be though since in the real world were surrounded by objects all the time. A lot of people have problems making the connection though..Good luck with your game. It sounds interesting.,None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 10:14 am -04:00,Thomas you got it right in terms of how to create a second character. And as Anonymous pointed out theres no conflict between the two.Thats the whole purpose of a class. Theres one blueprint i.e. a car class and multiple instances of cars. So one instance doesnt replace another. Each one is a separate object that you created. Think of a Toyota Camry theres one blueprint i.e. one car class and millions of cars on the road. Each car is a separate object but they all share the same properties as Anonymous mentioned above.Notice how each character below is a separate object and has its own memory address. Thats how Python knows whos who and where the data for each individual character is stored. I also created a sidekick for Hero Dude. :)  >>> hero_dude = Character(2 10 6 2)>>> hero_dude<__main__.Character object at 0x000000000329FBE0>>>> type(hero_dude)<class __main__.Character>>>> id(hero_dude)53083104>>> villian = Character(4 12 7 4)>>> villian<__main__.Character object at 0x000000000331A080>>>> type(villian)<class __main__.Character>>>> id(villian)53584000>>> sidekick = Character(2 8 4 2)>>> sidekick<__main__.Character object at 0x000000000331A128>>>> type(sidekick)<class __main__.Character>>>> id(sidekick)53584168,None,2
Tuesday September 10th 2013 1:55 pm -04:00,It has to do with the concept of a slice.If you think about it lets take a pizza and slice it up into four equal pieces or slices. If you put those four pieces back together then it should equal the sum total of what the pizza looked like beforehand.Now apply the same concept to the string Learn to Program. If we slice it up and then put it back together well it should be exactly the same as before. For example:  >>> s = Learn to Program>>> sLearn to Program>>> s[0:4] + s[4:8] + s[8:12] + s[12:16]Learn to Program  By making the second number non-inclusive it facilitates our ability to break things apart. And if we ever have to put them back together then the slices wont overlap. Or get a sum total that is actually bigger than before.One quick way to think about slices is to take the difference between the two numbers. So s[8:12] has a difference of 4 which is 4/16 or 1/4 of the string. Pretty cool eh? :)The same concept applies to a sequence of numbers exactly as Tom mentioned above. Instead of a slice though its a range of numbers. Notice how nothing overlaps and the sum total is still correct:  >>> range_1 = [x for x in range(010)]>>> range_1[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]>>> range_2 = [x for x in range(1020)]>>> range_2[10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19]>>> total_range = range_1 + range_2>>> total_range[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19]  Slicing and the range of numbers can be quite fun.All very cool concepts. :), Resolved,0

Friday September 13th 2013 4:05 am -04:00,Adina defragmenting and stacks have nothing to do with each other.Defragmenting has to do with your hard drive also known as your hard disk and not with any sort of memory either. As stuff gets saved onto your hard drive it may not necessarily get saved in the same area. Think of a video that you just downloaded. There may be fragments all over your hard drive. And when the time comes to play it well your hard drive is looking all over the place for the various fragments.So what defragmentation does is try to put all the various pieces of a video or whatever sort of file into one area of the hard drive. This way itll speed up your system and the hard drive itself wont have to keep looking for stuff.Youre right about the automatic defragmenting that goes on nowadays. Before you had to defrag every so often just to keep your hard drive up to speed. Now most of that is done automatically., Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 4:54 pm -04:00,Adina let me see if I can make some distinctions or try to clarify the situation since youre talking about a lot of different things.Hard drives and memory are both hardware. A hard drive is the spinning disk in your computer. Memory is made up of computer chips that are on your motherboard. The only difference between the two is that things stored on a hard drive are permanent. While things stored in a memory chip will disappear when you turn the power off.Now in terms of software. Software doesnt have memory. Software is just lines of code that are stored on your hard drive. And if you run a piece of software then some of the code will also be loaded into the memory chips since its much easier and faster to process bits of information in a memory chip than it is on a hard drive. Hard drives are very slow compared to memory chips.Now in terms of what were talking about i.e. stacks and frames. Those are just programming terms. If you create a function then a frame gets created and that frame is stored somewhere in memory i.e. it has a memory address. If you call a function then another frame gets created which also gets stored in memory. And frames get stacked on top of one another.Eventually as your program does its thing well frames will disappear one by one since each frame does its thing and returns a value to the previous frame that called it. Think of it as an un-stacking of frames.Hope thats a little more clear in terms of what you mentioned., Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 3:44 am -04:00,I wouldnt get too hung up on the jargon. Its very much common sense.Think of a stack of books. Thats all it is. One book on top of another. Or as Professor Gries mentioned in one of his videos its like a stack of plates but upside down. The upside down reference is because a frame gets created and instead of being put on top its put below.A frame itself isnt too complicated. We all have frames at home you know like a picture frame with four sides that looks like a box. Thats why they call it a frame. Except in this instance a frame is a so-called global frame with its function definitions and other frames that get stacked as functions get called. No matter the frames are still four-sided boxes that represent function calls. Thats why they call it a call stack. Function calls stacked on top of each other.We could try and make it more complicated but then it would probably be for a cocktail party or something. :), Resolved,1

Wednesday September 11th 2013 9:04 am -04:00,Just a few things...First the autograder is hosted on the University of Toronto computer system. One of the TAs had mentioned it in another thread. Maybe someone can find it? But every few seconds or so it checks with the Coursera platform to see if anything has been submitted. If so then it does its thing and sends the results back.Second the 1-hour delay is like a maximum time period. Maybe I just got lucky but for Assignment 1 I submitted 8 times within a period of 90 minutes. Basically submitting every 10 minutes after completing each step one by one.So it probably depends on the time of day i.e. I started submitting around 3:30 AM (ET). But I know for myself it was not a problem. Never got any error delay messages or anything like that and basically submitted when I wanted.Edit: My mistake that 3:30 AM time is actually UTC. I took a look at my assignment page and heres the actually submission times in ET: Thu-05-Sep 23:33:53Thu-05-Sep 23:43:32Thu-05-Sep 23:53:15Fri-06-Sep 00:26:30Fri-06-Sep 00:44:19Fri-06-Sep 00:56:44Fri-06-Sep 01:10:09Fri-06-Sep 01:20:40So its 8 submissions in 1 hour and 46 minutes., Resolved,3

Monday September 16th 2013 5:34 pm -04:00,The string module still exists but most of the functions that once existed in earlier versions of Python have now been turned into string methods instead. Heres one function that still exists though inside the string module and is actually kind of handy:  >>> import string>>> text =   lEaRn tO    proGram >>> string.capwords(text)Learn To Program  In terms of functionality there are several reasons why some functions are in a modules and why some functions are methods instead and live in a class. The issue of memory has already been mentioned above but heres a few more...First it doesnt always make sense to create methods for everything. Youd be writing a lot of duplicate code for nothing. For example take the len() function. Why is there no string method that gives us the length of a string i.e. my_string.len(). The answer is because having one generic function that calculates the length of a string can also be used for other types as well. Like lists for example. One function many applications.Second theres the historical legacy aspect. No doubt it took awhile to turn string functions into string methods. I can imagine that a lot of existing code uses the square root function for example. We could probably create a square root method that is tied directly to a number when its created. Something like the following but theres probably no need:  >>> 144.sqrt()12.0  No doubt there many other reasons but I hope this is somewhat useful in explaining the differences., Resolved,1
Friday October 4th 2013 9:16 pm -04:00,You are correct that there is a string method to get length. But the so-called special or magic methods are not always equivalent to their function counterparts.Some functions have added functionality compared to their special methods. Functionality such as checking for errors or the ability to handle exceptions. Theres also the issue of future changes to the underlying code which may cause a program to break if someone is not using the proper method or function to begin with.For example s.__next__() is not equivalent to next(s):   >>> s = iter(a)>>> s.__next__()a>>> s.__next__()Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#71> line 1 in <module>    s.__next__()StopIteration>>> s = iter(a)>>> next(s)a>>> next(s)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#74> line 1 in <module>    next(s)StopIteration  In the above code both of them broke as expected. Below its different in that the function can handle the exception simply because it has added functionality:>>> s = iter(a)>>> s.__next__()Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#76> line 1 in <module>    s.__next__()TypeError: expected 0 arguments got 1>>> s = iter(a)>>> next(s )a>>> next(s )  , Resolved,0

Thursday September 12th 2013 1:43 pm -04:00,Theres Alt + P and Alt + N...But one really handy shortcut is to use your mouse click on a previous statement and press Enter. This way you dont have to cycle through all the previous statements if you dont want to.Also works great for values that are returned. So for example if a statement returns a long string then you could just click on whatevers returned and press Enter. That way you dont have to type everything out again.And you could even do multiple mouse clicks + Enter if you want. Lets say you have three previous expressions that you want to put into one statement.

Theres leeway within the Honor Code that is really at the discretion of the staff.Obviously posting stuff before a deadline is against the Honor Code but after a deadline it really is up to the instructors of a course. And having taking the Interactive Python myself its also true what Nick mentioned. In fact there was so much code being posted that at some point it became totally irrelevant. Threads with like 500 posts LOL.Another thing that Ive seen from a previous course Mathematical Thinking which was really great. Is that the professor would create weekly videos after an assignment had been completed. For example if the deadline is Sunday at midnight then he would create a video which would come out on the following Wednesday. And in that video he would not only give the correct answers but work through the problems themselves. There was usually 2-3 of those videos per week covering assignments that were both graded and not graded.Theres an infamous video of Alice is a rock star and works in a bank where the professor created a 10-minute video of how to think about that particular question. And in that video he focused on just two questions from the assignment. Why create a video that focuses on just two questions? Well he had been monitoring the forums looking at test scores and had determined that these two particular questions were the ones that students were having the most problems with. Great way of teaching.And just a note all those videos and answers to various assignments are still available. I just checked and actually re-watched the Alice video LOL. And this course was back in September 2012 with its third iteration currently taking place if you can believe it., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 3:52 pm -04:00,Python has a CSV module that you can use to import your data. Its pretty straightforward to use and the following link has several examples: http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/csv.htmlThe hardest part is to figure out how to manipulate the data. But it seems like youve already figured that out in terms of stripping whitespace etc.Another option is to use a combination of NumPy and a pandas DataFrame. Thats pretty heavy-duty though and has lots of tools for manipulating data. Also quite a learning curve if youve never worked with matrices etc.I guess it all depends on how complicated your program is but the CSV module is a good starting point.,None,1
Thursday September 12th 2013 5:10 pm -04:00,Lets start with the whitespace since thats easier. Remember the string methods weve learned so far? Theres the strip method which will remove whitespace at the beginning and end. If you want to remove all whitespace then use the replace method.So you could do something like this: >>> postal_code = AA11 1AA>>> postal_codeAA11 1AA>>> postal_code.replace(  )AA111AA>>> postal_code = postal_code.replace(  )>>> postal_codeAA111AA>>> ,None,2
Thursday September 12th 2013 5:31 pm -04:00,Easiest way to read or import files is to set a path variable. Theres slightly more complicated code that you could use such as the Tkinter GUI to pop up a dialog box and browse for the file.But something basic would look like this: import csvpath = c:/temp/file = some.csvwith open(path + file newline=) as f:    reader = csv.reader(f)    for row in reader:        print(row)>>> ================================ RESTART ================================>>> [Nick Sarbicki  AA11 1AA][Alain Rouleau  A1B 2C3]>>>,None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 6:24 pm -04:00,Checking the length of a postal code is definitely a good idea. But from I understand the UK postal codes can be anywhere from 5-8 characters in length?Theres also a third option which is a little more complicated and involves the use of regular expressions. Not sure if youve heard of regular expressions before? But theyre used to make sure postal codes phone numbers etc. are all valid. For example heres some code that checks whether a string is a valid UK postal code: >>> import re>>> post_code_1 = AA11 1AA>>> post_code_2 = AA111AA>>> print(re.findall(r[A-Z]{12}[0-9R][0-9A-Z]? [0-9][A-Z]{2} post_code_1))[AA11 1AA]>>> print(re.findall(r[A-Z]{12}[0-9R][0-9A-Z]? [0-9][A-Z]{2} post_code_2))>>> re.findall(r[A-Z]{12}[0-9R][0-9A-Z]? [0-9][A-Z]{2} post_code_1) != True>>> re.findall(r[A-Z]{12}[0-9R][0-9A-Z]? [0-9][A-Z]{2} post_code_2) != False  Basically regular expressions check to see if a string is in a certain format. In the above code if the postal code is valid then it gets put into a list. If the postal code is not valid then the list is empty. Which means you can check if the list is empty or not i.e. True or False. And in the above example we know postal_code_2 is not valid because the list is empty.The format of the regular expression above is one that I Googled so Im not even sure if its 100% valid in terms of UK postal codes. But there are regular expressions out there for just about everything including credit card numbers email addresses etc.So regular expressions are just another option to think about if you want to test for validity.Edit: Reference the regular expression method Im sure theres a better one than findall since that one is more for finding a particular string in a much larger string such as a text file. But the idea is still the same.,None,0
Friday September 13th 2013 3:05 am -04:00,If I could offer up a suggestion and Ive seen this done in other courses.

Thursday September 12th 2013 9:48 pm -04:00,The problem is the use of upper and lowercase letters. C and c is not the same. Thats a big problem and everything should be consistent so if you change the C then everything works: >>> def controlFunction(a b C):        A B Z = start(a b C),None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 11:15 pm -04:00,Just a note and Im sure you guys know this already but all variables should be lowercase. The only time a variable is in uppercase is when its a constant. For example:  BOILING_POINT = 100 # the temperture at which water boils in CelciusS = 299792458 # speed of light in metres per secondroom_temperature = 23s = 65  Thats if youre into coding style.

Thursday September 12th 2013 10:35 pm -04:00,Okay thanks. But looking at the type of each index it really is saying that there are multiple lists within lists.

Thursday September 12th 2013 10:57 pm -04:00,Thats possible but I sure would like to know the answer.Heres another interesting view. Notice how it keeps maintaining the same structure as we keep going down level by level. What we see at level 1 is the same below:  >>> print(values[1][0])0>>> print(values[1][1])[0 [...] 2]>>> print(values[1][2])2>>> print(values[1][1][0])0>>> print(values[1][1][1])[0 [...] 2]>>> print(values[1][1][2])2,None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 11:32 pm -04:00,Thanks sounds like a pretty good answer. Definitely looks like a recursive data structure which would be very similar to a never-ending recursive function.You kind of wonder though why the whole system just doesnt crash? Or generate an error?,None,0

Sunday September 15th 2013 12:43 pm -04:00,Everything you need to know about how floating point numbers work in Python can be found in this document:   http://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html Its a bit long and complicated for people who arent familiar with how things work but I can explain some of the stuff and summarize the important parts. First there are two very important things when it comes to floating point numbers. Theres the actual number and then theres the representation of the number. Some programmers even call the representation an illusion. :) Second in Python floating point numbers can either be represented by 17 significant digits or a shortened version. For example 0.10000000000000001 or 0.1. Significant digits include all digits both to the left and the right of the decimal point except if the left digit is zero. So using your example of 7 / 3 and 2.3333333333333335 youll notice that it has 17 significant digits. Which is 1 to the left of the decimal point and 16 to the right. Thats how Python displays a floating point number. But this number is a representation and NOT the actual number. In the next post having covered the basics Ill show you how to see the actual number and why its a 5... ,None,3
Sunday September 15th 2013 1:02 pm -04:00,Heres the different ways of representing 7 / 3...  >>> 7 / 32.3333333333333335>>> format(7 / 3 .17g)2.3333333333333335>>> format(7 / 3 .16f)2.3333333333333335  First example was already explained above. Second example is how to format with 17 significant digits. Notice the g after 17. Third example is how to format with 16 digits to the right of the decimal point. Notice the f after 16. Whats importantto note is these are representations and NOT the actual number. And that they all do the same thing.Now the exciting part. Have you figured out how to see the actual number? Yes thats right just expand the number of digits to the right of the decimal point and voila! :)  >>> format(7 / 3 .60f)2.333333333333333481363069950020872056484222412109375000000000  Notice something really interesting? What the heck is 481363... doing after a bunch of threes? Thats where the five is coming from since its rounding up from 481363....In the next post Ill explain how the actual number gets generated. ,None,2
Sunday September 15th 2013 2:20 pm -04:00,For people interested in the actual number and how it gets created theres a couple of things to know. And all of this can be found in the link above. Highly recommend you bookmark that Python web page for future reference. First as Nick mentioned all numbers cant be represented by 1s and 0s. So theres this standard that has been developed over the years to approximate certain numbers. The standard is known as IEEE 754 with the latest version being IEEE 754-2008. And this standard is pretty much in all computers:   http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/ http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4610935   Second theres the easy way to calculate floats and the actual number. And then theres the hard way which is more step by step using formulas. Easy way is to use existing functions. Floats are just two integers divided by themselves so you can use the decimal or fractions modules. Heres several examples in terms of how to find the two integers that created the float for 7 / 3:    >>> from decimal import Decimal>>> from fractions import Fraction>>> >>> Fraction.from_float(2.3333333333333335)Fraction(5254199565265579 2251799813685248)>>> 5254199565265579 / 22517998136852482.3333333333333335>>> format(5254199565265579 / 2251799813685248 .60f)2.333333333333333481363069950020872056484222412109375000000000>>> format(5254199565265579 / 2 ** 51 .60f)2.333333333333333481363069950020872056484222412109375000000000>>> 2251799813685248 == 2 ** 51True>>> >>> (2.3333333333333335).as_integer_ratio()(5254199565265579 2251799813685248)>>> Decimal.from_float(2.3333333333333335)Decimal(2.333333333333333481363069950020872056484222412109375)>>> format(Decimal.from_float(2.3333333333333335) .17)2.3333333333333335>>> format(Decimal.from_float(2.3333333333333335) .53)2.333333333333333481363069950020872056484222412109375   Definitely no lack of functions.Hope this was a good summary. If anyone is interested in doing it the hard way which is more step by step using formulas then let me know. The Python document shows you how to do it for 0.1 but 7 / 3 is slightly harder. Nice little challenge. :),None,1

But what youre asking is pretty big way beyond the scope of this course if you ask me. Its like asking the people who run Coursera to change their whole business model. It would be like turning Coursera into another Udacity.In terms of the issue of fairness you have to look at it from the viewpoint of other students as well. In this course we havent been posting code and discussing the answers yet.

Think of a game that youve been playing for awhile. You either dont like how its going or youd simply like to start over.As for saving the work that youve done the shell isnt really the place to save stuff. Its more of a place to have a conversation with your computer dont laugh. A place where you have some sort of interactive session to test your ideas get feedback have the computer do stuff for you and so on. Exactly like a telephone conversation in that you dont save your telephone conversations do you?But if you did want to save your work i.e. function definitions fancy expressions etc. then all that work should really be saved in a separate module.

Is that part of the assignment?, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 3:59 am -04:00,Easiest way is to create a separate .py file and run it as a module like you did. Paste the code from the question but be sure to include the two grade variables inside the module as well. And change them as you test. For example:  grade1 = 55.0grade2 = 49.0total = 0grade_count = 0##if grade1 >= 50:##    total = total + grade1##    grade_count = grade_count + 1##    if grade2 >= 50:##        total = total + grade2##        grade_count = grade_count + 1####if grade_count > 0:##    print(total / grade_count)##else:##    print(0.0)if grade1 >= 50 and grade2 >= 50:    total = grade1 + grade2    grade_count = 2if grade_count > 0:    print(total / grade_count)else:    print(0.0)  Also what you can do is just create one .py file instead of four. Or instead of copy/pasting on top of prior code just comment out the previous code. For example select and highlight the lines then use Alt + 3 to Comment Out a Region or Alt + 4 to Uncomment a Region., Resolved,3
Sunday September 15th 2013 4:10 am -04:00,Or if you really want to get fancy use an input statement inside the module for each grade. That way when you run the module it will ask you to input the grades inside the shell.Not sure if youre getting a NameError? But if you dont define the grade variables within the module then Python doesnt know what to do when it gets to the if statements. It tries to do something with the if statement but its never heard of grade1 or grade2 before. So it produces an error like...  >>> ================================ RESTART ================================>>> Traceback (most recent call last):  File C:\Python33emp\grades.py line 18 in <module>    if grade1 >= 50 and grade2 >= 50:NameError: name grade1 is not defined  Is that what you were getting? , Resolved,2

But you have a lot of catching up to do since youve missed 4/7 weeks.In terms of grading and getting a certificate several deadlines have passed such as 3x Exercises @ 5% each and 1x Assignment @ 10%. So theoretically its still possible to get a statement of accomplishment if you meet all the other deadlines.If none of the above is important and you just want to learn to program well you have plenty of time.Good luck!,None,0

Monday September 16th 2013 2:24 am -04:00,Sometimes there are subtle differences between a right and a wrong answer. And it doesnt take very much for it to be marked incorrectly i.e. you added an extra space left out a parentheses etc.But theres one thing you can do since you have both a correct answer and an incorrect answer. And that is to compare the two strings. For example:  >>> test5 = your_function(another_function(argument1 argument2))>>> test7 = your_function(another_function(argument1 argument2))>>> test5 == test7True  Now that will tell you right away if your answers are indeed both the same.Next if they are the same then the next step would be to check the actual questions. As you re-attempt certain exercises the questions may change. Theres a built-in mechanism to randomly produce new questions and even change the answers on different attempts. I dont think thats the case for this particular question though. It seems to remain the same but its always a good idea to check beforehand.Hope the idea of comparing strings helped out., Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 7:48 pm -04:00,Tracey I totally agree with you.For example in the Interactive course theres a lot of Python stuff that they just gloss over or simply dont explain.

Monday September 16th 2013 5:08 am -04:00,Kenneth your approach to tinkering around is exactly what everybody on this course should be doing. Thats the only way to really learn something. I know for myself I do a lot of tinkering. Always trying to play around with the various exercises in the videos in the assignments etc.But I wouldnt get too hung up on the assignments. Theyre deliberately made to be annoying and to test your patience. Sadly for better or for worse a lot of programming involves so-called mathmatic word problem structures. These assignments are deliberately designed to take you out of your comfort zone and to introduce you to problem domains that you may not even care about. Theyre just a test to see if you can break things down into various components. And have the ability to follow step-by-step instructions. Know doubt as you gain more experience it will all seem very trivial.One thing Id suggest is to post more of your tinkering.You know small snippets of code or whatever. Im sure others could learn from what they see as well good or bad.

Any experienced programmer knows exactly how that range function works like the back of their hand. And what the statement print all the numbers in the range of 1 to 10 actually means.What Tom mentioned is spot on in terms of how the range function works. Not quite sure how much programming experience you have? But Ive never heard of the method that you described in terms of range(1) range(2) range(3) etc. And then somehow adding them all up removing the duplicates and coming out with some sort of list? That just doesnt make any sort of sense. Why would you even try to do it that way?, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 3:25 pm -04:00,Anonymous my intent was never to make anyone feel bad. If you keep insisting on things that are not correct then what am I suppose to do? Agree with you?The following is a perfect example. You used the word slide four times stating things like it was pretty clear to anyone who watched the slide. I then tell you that its not a slide but that the typo were talking about is on a web page i.e. the lecture notes.And for whatever reason your response was quit posting code and documentation when nobody has a question about the code. Sorry if you have problems with people posting code or links to documentation but thats the web page were talking about!Yet youre still continuing to insist that its a slide Yes its the slide for the lecture on range.Why? I dont know. So what am I suppose to say now that doesnt make you feel bad?, Resolved,0

Tuesday September 17th 2013 2:53 pm -04:00,I agree that theres an issue with this function.The type contract doesnt allow for the type of NoneType as Anonymous mentioned above. And it also fails the doctest since its expecting None.Now we could change return None to return print(None) but thats not the same thing as returning None.

Wednesday September 18th 2013 1:53 am -04:00,Tolunay thats the best answer Ive seen so far in terms of the type contract thanks.Not quite sure if thats some sort of official notation but it probably looks better with some spacing?  (str) -> str | None  In terms of the blank line in the docstring. Thats probably the best solution since were not messing around with the actual function. I would just add that providing a comment for returning None would go a long way as well.So the docstring could look something like this. It passed all the doctests and the function itself is also very happy. :)      (str) -> str | None    Return the last vowel in s if one exists; otherwise return None.        >>> last_vowel(cauliflower)    e    >>> last_vowel(pfft) # returns None        , Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 5:37 pm -04:00,I agree with Tolunay in that using return print(None) is a bad idea. Using that statement changes the actual output of the function from None which is of the type NoneType to some sort of print statement that we dont want., Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 6:33 pm -04:00,Not bad but theres a few things that could be improved. For example theres a lot of repetitive code that could be easily replaced with the use of variables. If you have two functions like range100() and range1000() that do the exact same thing then you know theres a problem.So you could do something like the following instead. Create a single initialization function that uses variables and a formula to calculate the number of guesses for each range. Something like this:  secret_num = random.randrange(0 num_range)# formula to calculate the number of allowed guesses is 2 ** n >= high - low + 1count1 = math.ceil(math.log(num_range 2))  Guess the number is always interesting. :),None,1
Tuesday September 17th 2013 5:16 am -04:00,Claus I agree with pretty much everything you wrote. Except that code redundancy or repetitive code isnt a special area.Everything weve learned in terms of how to design a function on this course has been to make sure we dont repeat ourselves. So for example making two copies of the same range() function is not the correct way of doing things. We learned to create just one function but to pass different arguments instead. Functions should always be unique.Same thing for if and elif statements. We learned that if you have multiple ifs or elifs then it may be possible to use the logical operators and and or instead.So to quote the Zen of Python... :) Beautiful is better than ugly;Simple is better than complex;Flat is better than nested; andThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it,None,0
Monday September 16th 2013 8:37 pm -04:00,Barry very nice. Minimal use of functions and very compact. I like your code.But my advice is the same as above. A lot of repetitive code that shouldnt exist. For example you can easily combine the two main if and elif blocks into one by using variables and a formula to calculate guesses.So it would look something like this instead:  http://paste.debian.net/41434/  import mathimport randomprint()print(Lets play guess the secret number.)print(Do you want to try to guess a number less than 100 or less than 1000?)limit = int(input(enter 100 or 1000 ))while limit != 100 and limit != 1000:    limit = int(input(enter 100 or 1000 ))guess = 0counter = 0if limit == 100 or limit == 1000:    num_guess = math.ceil(math.log(limit 2))    secret = random.randrange(1 limit)    print (The secret number is between 1 and limit - 1 inclusively.)    print(0 and limit are not included.)    print ( You have num_guess guesses.)    while guess != secret and counter < num_guess:        counter = counter + 1         guess = int(input(   What is your guess? ))        if secret > guess:            print (    The secret number is higher.

Friday September 20th 2013 10:08 pm -04:00,Seyed-Mahdy thats correct. Its because one is indexing and the other is slicing., Unresolved,1
Friday September 20th 2013 11:31 pm -04:00,Ashwini what youve stumbled across is a slightly more advanced way in terms of indexing and slicing.In this course weve learned that the index position is the character itself in order to try and keep things as simple as possible since we have a lot of things to learn. But heres the slightly more advanced way...The indexing is actually both negative and positive. So it would look like this:   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12  13  14  15  16 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   L   e   a   r   n       t   o       P   r   o   g   r   a   m |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |-16 -15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9  -8  -7  -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1   0  Personally I like this method quite a lot since you can do some pretty deep thinking. It works as you described above. But before you even think about how it works its important to understand the fundamentals.First indexing is not some sort of technical term that we use in programming or just in Python. Think about how indexing works in real life. Take a book for example. We go to the index at the back of the book look up a word and it gives us a page number.That page number is the index number so that we can actually find the word itself. Lets say its page[9]. What then? Well what we actually do is go to page 9 and start reading from the left edge of the page from left to right.Exactly as you described above.So in my example its not a book but a string instead. No matter it still works in the same way. Learn to Program[9] returns P. We go to 9 and start reading from the edge again from left to right. Notice that wecould have done Learn to Program[-7]as well. Same thing since we go to the edge located at -7 and start reading from left to right again returning P.Second slicing is not some technical term either. Think about how slicing works in real life. Take a pizza a birthday cake or whatever. We first need a knife or some sort of cutting device. What next? Well we usually need two cuts in orderto extract a slice. Unless were starting from the edge of the cake thats already been cut. But no matter we still need two cuts.So in my example its not a birthday cake but a string instead. If I want to extract a slice from the string then what do I need? No I dont need a knife but I still need two cuts. If I want to slice out the word earn then whereare the cuts going to take place? Thats right one cut will be at 1 and the other at 5. Which will look like [1:5] or Learn to Program[1:5] which returns earn.Now whats the exact same slice using negative numbers? Work through it the same way. We need two cuts with the first cut taking place at -15 and the second cut at -11. Which will look like [-15:-11] or Learn to Program[-15:-11] which returns earn.Pretty cool eh? Ill make another post with some other cool ways to think about slicing.  , Unresolved,4
Saturday September 21st 2013 12:39 am -04:00,Heres some ways to think about slicing using the example above.First what does the slice Learn to Program[1:5] tell us about its length? We know the slice earn has a length of 4 characters. But could we have figured that out by looking at [1:5] or [-15:-11]?Notice that the difference between the two numbers is4. Whats the length of Learn to Program[9:16] which returns Program? Its 7 of course len(Learn to Program[9:16]) returns 7. So one of my friends makes a cake that looks exactly like Learn to Program. Weve just passed the course and theres four of us. Luckily it has a length of 16 which can be easily sliced up into four pieces. How dowe do that? Well its very easy: >>> s = Learn to Program>>> s1 = s[0:4]>>> s2 = s[4:8]>>> s3 = s[8:12]>>> s4 = s[12:16]  Remember to use the difference between the numbers so that the length for each slice is 4. And to think about the two cuts in terms of where the edges are.Now at this point somebody makes a comment and my friend who made the cake feels insulted grabs all four pieces and puts them back into the box. What does the cake look like now? Or what should it look like? Lets try to put the four slices back together:  >>> cake_in_box = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4>>> cake_in_boxLearn to Program  Its magic!Think about how powerful this is in terms of slicing a string. We could create a for loop for example and slice it into a hundred pieces. Either all with the same length or not. And actually put everything back together into one piece.Slicing and indexing in action. :)  , Unresolved,2

Tuesday September 17th 2013 1:20 pm -04:00,Technically everything in Python is an object. It all depends in terms of how deep you want to go into the code. But even modules themselves are objects. For example:  >>> import math>>> math<module math (built-in)>>>> type(math)<class module>>>> id(math)52724488>>> import random>>> random<module random from C:\\Python33\\lib\\random.py>>>> type(random)<class module>>>> id(random)52690440  So Python searched for the module when you I used import. Found it created an instance of the module class i.e. an object and assigned a variable i.e. math to point to the address of the object in memory i.e. the id().In terms of the syntax i.e. abc.xyz its just a hierarchy of left to right. We could easily have abc.def.ghi.jkl.xyz as well. But abc is an object so is def etc. For example:  >>> import builtins>>> builtins.len.__class__.__class__.__class__<class type>  And as Stijn mentioned above if you leave off the parentheses then youre just getting information i.e. the attribute of the object. When you uses parentheses then youre obviously executing a method or function call. For example:  >>> str.find<method find of str objects>>>> id(abc)35321816>>> hex(35321816)0x21af7d8>>> abc.find<built-in method find of str object at 0x000000000213F7D8>>>> type(abc.find)<class builtin_function_or_method>>>> abc.find(c)2, Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 17th 2013 1:59 pm -04:00,In terms of the len() function its kind of special because its a built-in function. Which means that the actual function is written in the C programming language. So in order to work with a C function we need some sort of middleman. And that middleman is something called a wrapper...A built-in function object is a wrapper around a C function. Examples of built-in functions are len() and math.sin() (math is a standard built-in module). The number and type of the arguments are determined by the C function.http://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/datamodel.htmlThere are different types of wrappers in order to interface with the underlying language. Technical terms but theres method wrappers slot wrappers and so on. The built-in types like int str and list use slot wrappers:  >>> abc.__len__<method-wrapper __len__ of str object at 0x000000000213F7D8>>>> type(abc.__len__)<class method-wrapper>>>> str.__len__<slot wrapper __len__ of str objects>>>> type(str.__len__)<class wrapper_descriptor>   Now if youre not totally confused this is the easy part...Not all objects require their own methods. Think of abc.len() in terms of string methods. Doesnt exist because then we would need one for lists tuples and dictionaries as well. Much better to use a single generic C function with a wrapper on top. For now anyways. :)  , Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 18th 2013 2:15 am -04:00,Anonymous this is how basic object-oriented programming works (OOP). Will try and make it as simple as possible.Class is like a blueprint. It contains all the information in terms of how to build an Object. Just like the blueprint for a house.Objects are instances of the Class. Just one Class but many Objects that are all built the same way. Exactly like a house one blueprint but a whole bunch of houses that look the same way.Methods are the way we interact with Objects. If I want to change a string to uppercase then I need some sort of way or Method to do that.Now you know OOP. :)The concept of Objects in programming is exactly like the real world., Unresolved,1

Thursday September 19th 2013 6:48 am -04:00,This is sort of a trick question when you think about it since the issue isnt really about the cap threshold. Or what happens after the while statement gets executed. We could be adding two numbers together for all we care.The reason the answer is incorrect is that > and >= are not the same. Has nothing to do with the output. First thing we have to do is check to see if something is greater than 3. We dont want to check if something is greater or equal to 3.So Rich had an answer with >= as one of his options. Which tells you right away that its incorrect.The rest of the code and the output is irrelevant., Unresolved,1
Thursday September 19th 2013 12:25 pm -04:00,List comprehensions are one of the best features in Python. You can do all sorts of things with them.Everybody should know how they work., Unresolved,2
Thursday September 26th 2013 10:33 am -04:00,Heres a slightly more advanced example. Its from someone else on another course so I cant take credit. But I like it so much since it clearly illustrates the power of list comprehensions:  >>> import itertools>>>>>> [r for r in itertools.product(range(11) repeat=4) if sum(r) == 10][(0 0 0 10) (0 0 1 9) (0 0 2 8) (0 0 3 7) (0 0 4 6) (0 0 5 5) (0 0 6 4) (0 0 7 3) (0 0 8 2) (0 0 9 1) (0 0 10 0) (0 1 0 9) (0 1 1 8) (0 1 2 7) (0 1 3 6) (0 1 4 5) (0 1 5 4) (0 1 6 3) ... (6 1 2 1) (6 1 3 0) (6 2 0 2) (6 2 1 1) (6 2 2 0) (6 3 0 1) (6 3 1 0) (6 4 0 0) (7 0 0 3) (7 0 1 2) (7 0 2 1) (7 0 3 0) (7 1 0 2) (7 1 1 1) (7 1 2 0) (7 2 0 1) (7 2 1 0) (7 3 0 0) (8 0 0 2) (8 0 1 1) (8 0 2 0) (8 1 0 1) (8 1 1 0) (8 2 0 0) (9 0 0 1) (9 0 1 0) (9 1 0 0) (10 0 0 0)]  Im pretty sure everyone can follow along. Theres the r variable in the front followed by the for loop and then the conditional if statement at the end.So what this does is create a list of tuples with all the possible 4-digit combinations that sum up to 10. I didnt list them all but as you can see theres 286 possible combinations:  >>> len([r for r in itertools.product(range(11) repeat=4) if sum(r) == 10])286  , Unresolved,1
Thursday October 3rd 2013 7:40 pm -04:00,Yes have you taken it before?Usually theres a lot of advanced programmers on that course. The code above is a simplified version though. I removed the NumPy array code in order to just show the list comprehension.Some of the code that people were coming up with on that course was much more complex though since it involved all sorts of different ways to generate an array. And to do it in the most efficient manner that didnt waste time as well.  , Unresolved,0

Youre trying to add two variables together where get_complementary_sequence doesnt exist yet hence the message referenced before assignment.So Python is telling you that you need some sort of assignment statement before you reference it. Remember the videos on how to make a variable an accumulator? How do we do that? How do we create an accumulator?, Unresolved,2

Functions are for returning stuff. So think of what you would use instead of print?And youre getting an error because since youre not returning anything in your get_complement() function then what happens is that None gets returned instead.Hence the message of Cant convert NoneType object to a string.

Thursday September 19th 2013 7:43 pm -04:00,Creating a test is a possibility. But as discussed in previous threads and more generic to programming in general if youre going to test something then you need to test for all possibilities. Now creating sample data that can test for all possibilities can be quite problematic in that you may not know if its actually testing for all possibilities.For example its always fun to test-drive a car. But did you also take it on the highway and into the back woods? How about at night? Or during the winter?Another approach is to look at the code itself and what is required of the function. So-called tracing the code by hand. So given (4) choices and only (1) correct answer what you can do instead is to eliminate each choice one-by-one simply but looking at the if statements and the logic itself.Or you can always pick c) which also works just as good. ;-)  , Unresolved,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 2:30 am -04:00,Anonymous in terms of Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python its difficult in the following senses...In this course we spend a lot of time on the fundamentals exactly as the title suggests which is really good. So we learn about the function design recipe how to properly write a docstring how the visualizer works etc.In the IIPP course though how functions work are like a whopping 10-minutes. Forget about how to properly write a docstring or anything to do with a function design recipe. Theres no time for any of that.Instead of one exercise per week theres like two. Instead of one assignment every two weeks theres like one per week. And theyre not assignments but mini-projects. So you have to build a complete game of Memory Pong Blackjack etc. each one all in a week.Plus after submitting your mini-projects you then have to peer-assess a minimum of five other min-projects per week. You know looking at other peoples code and grading it. Theres no auto-grader.And on top of learning about the basics for strings lists etc. You also have to learn OOP (object-oriented programming) and GUIs (graphical user interfaces). Not to mention various math formulas to calculate speed acceleration vectors and so much more.Did I scare you yet? Not a problem if youre willing to put in the effort. And a fair amount of hours. But dont expect to watch a few videos answer a few questions and then somehow be able to pass the course. Its definitely not like that at all.Good luck though.  ,None,6

Saturday September 21st 2013 10:38 pm -04:00,Chrissie is exactly right. This is like my 2nd year on Coursera. And in terms of everything you mentioned above dont worry about it.Seriously Coursera isnt a brick-and-mortar university where you get penalized for messing up. And not showing up on time. Or not un-enrolling when you should have. None of that exists on Coursera so far.I say so far because hopefully things wont change in the future. Right now its very much a place to learn you know as in what a real university should be like. So you can sign up for as many courses as you want. Watch or dont watch videos. Complete the exercises and various assignments or dont complete them. And take the course over and over again without penalty.I know personally there are courses that I plan on taking maybe 3-4 times perhaps even 10 times LOL. Not because I want to get a certificate. But simply because I want to learn something. And be able to finally get it.So I always see comments about people wanting to un-enroll. And my first question is always why? Unless you really really dont want to have anything to do with a particular course then theres really no reason.Good luck though on whatever course of action you choose to take.  ,None,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 11:17 pm -04:00,Evelyn I also took the Interactive Programming course like a year ago. Definitely a lot of fun but also quite a lot of work. If youre doing good on this course then itll help quite a lot in terms of trying to understand whats actually going on in that course.What Im about to describe is not giving anything away in terms of the Interactive Programming course so dont worry. They basically tell you which method to use in the random module. Which is actually kind of sucky if you ask me since its way too simple. You yourself probably already know how to create your own function that actually shuffles a bunch of cards. Its just a matter of following a bunch of steps. But more on that later.So Im not going to get into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) since youll learn all about that in October. But heres a very basic way of creating a deck of 52-cards that are just numbers...  >>> import random>>> deck = >>> for card in range(52):	deck.append(card)>>> deck[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51]>>> random.shuffle(deck)>>> deck[14 32 35 6 42 49 19 40 11 39 9 27 33 23 10 16 36 24 13 30 43 37 28 38 46 17 3 51 15 4 20 12 26 22 25 21 48 34 18 29 1 50 7 31 45 47 44 0 2 41 8 5]  This is all stuff you already know. Pretty easy isnt it? Notice the import statement to import the random module. Theres an accumulator the range function the append method for a list. And the only thing thats new is the shuffle method.Now in real life those numbers would actually be objects i.e. cards. But I think you still get the idea.How to pick a card? You could use the range function again as described above or just deal the first/last card from the deck by using the pop method.I love the pop method and youll definitely need to know that one. :)P.S. Im also a croupier in real life so Ill make another post to describe what actually happens in a real shuffle. Which is definitely much more interesting than the shuffle method thats for sure.  ,None,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 5:02 am -04:00,Evelyn I understand what youre saying... But random is random.It doesnt matter whether you choose to shuffle the cards in a so-called fixed list for example and to then choose the first card. Or have a fixed list and randomly choose an index number from 1 to 52. Its the exact same thing. In fact the shuffle method actually calls random within the random module to shuffle the cards. Theres no difference.Now obviously using the pop method is totally different. If you remove a card from the deck then theres absolutely no chance whatsoever that it can be selected again. Only way for that particular card to be selected again would be to reconstitute the deck.In terms of the shaman thats so easy to do. Theres a bag with 27 stones each stone has a face and a back i.e. 54 possible definitions. Those are like the properties. Theyre like upside down or right-side up. You simply create a list which represents the bag. Each stone is an object in that bag and you can either shuffle them or leave them as is to then select randomly.In fact once the stones are an object theres no limit. Simply create an object to represent the mound and pop the stones from the bag onto the mound. From there its just a matter of writing if statements to see how the stones ended up i.e. did they stack on top of each other did they group together are they alone or whatever.Rinse and repeat very easy to do. :)  ,None,0

Somebody forgot to pick a new seed LOL.Needless to say that we dont use random number generators anymore its actual balls now.  Keno Scandal In April 1994 Daniel Corriveau won $600000 CAD playing keno. He picked 19 of the 20 winning numbers three times in a row. Corriveau claims he used a computer to discern a pattern in the sequence of numbers based on chaos theory. However it was later found that the sequence was easy to predict because the casino was using an inadequate electronic pseudorandom number generator. In fact the keno machine was reset every morning with the same seed number resulting in the same sequence of numbers being generated. Corriveau received his winnings after investigators cleared him of any wrongdoing.  http://www.blackjackforumonline.com/content/how_to_beat_keno.htm  ,None,0

Monday September 30th 2013 6:37 pm -04:00,Shannon it seems to me that you are very much motivated. And from what Ive seen you actually do put in a lot of hours and hard work.In terms of estimated hours and Ive mentioned this before but I think all courses on Coursera and not just this one routinely underestimate the gross number of hours that actual students require. As someone who has previous experience I look at the assignments as an average of 1-hour per week another hour for the videos another hour for the exercises. And another hour to discuss things on the forums? Thats already 4-hours and I havent even checked out the lecture notes re-watched videos tinkered around with the code or just hung out in the forums. Let alone anytime to make mistakes or to try and figure things out.So ya I fully understand it from a total newbie point of view in that some of you are easily putting in twice the number of hours if not more.  ,None,1
Monday September 30th 2013 6:54 pm -04:00,As for the course prerequisites and so-called absolute beginners. I agree that most of the time courses like this are couched in a way that when they mean beginners or this course is intended for people who have never seen a computer program well theres sort of an unwritten assumption that you know what a computer is and how it works. That you can think logically and that you have a certain capacity to not only understand but also absorb  the material that is being presented to you.Now maybe they should be more explicit in terms of the prerequisites? And try to cover all the caveats? I dont know. But I think it would probably be quite a long list.Just a side note and no disrespect to beginners so I hope that some people dont take it the wrong way. But this course is very much considered as being one of the easiest. The pace the workload and the amount of material you have to absorb on other so-called beginner courses is usually much more intense and definitely more time consuming.

Saturday October 5th 2013 5:05 am -04:00,Just wanted to mention that this is one of the best questions Ive seen so far.If you can visualize and fully understand how the list append() method works then youre really going to be ahead of the game. It really does have to do with the fact that the list append() method will modify an object in-place as opposed to creating a new object and then re-assigning it.So without giving away any answers I made a printout to visualize one of the more difficult choices. If you can see and fully understand whats actually going on below then its almost like a light bulb above the head moment. :)  >>> make_pairs([A B C] [1 2 3])--> Inner List:  Pairs: --> Inner List: [A] Pairs: --> Inner List: [A 1] Pairs: --> Inner List: [A 1] Pairs: [[A 1]]--> Inner List: [A 1] Pairs: [[A 1]]--> Inner List: [A 1 B] Pairs: [[A 1 B]]--> Inner List: [A 1 B 2] Pairs: [[A 1 B 2]]--> Inner List: [A 1 B 2] Pairs: [[A 1 B 2] [A 1 B 2]]--> Inner List: [A 1 B 2] Pairs: [[A 1 B 2] [A 1 B 2]]--> Inner List: [A 1 B 2 C] Pairs: [[A 1 B 2 C] [A 1 B 2 C]]--> Inner List: [A 1 B 2 C 3] Pairs: [[A 1 B 2 C 3] [A 1 B 2 C 3]]--> Inner List: [A 1 B 2 C 3] Pairs: [[A 1 B 2 C 3] [A 1 B 2 C 3] [A 1 B 2 C 3]][[A 1 B 2 C 3] [A 1 B 2 C 3] [A 1 B 2 C 3]]  , Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 4:52 pm -04:00,I think everyone understands how the variable works in the for loop. But I just wanted to say that its quite a common thing to not fully understand how each part of the for loop works especially when it comes to the variable. A lot of people have problems with that part.Python itself is probably to blame since it tries to keep the code as short as possible and doesnt necessarily break things down. And a lot of Python code tries to look like a regular English sentence as well hence for character in word or for mark in english. Which is great once you have experience and want to write programs. Not so great though if youre still trying to understand it.Breaking things down we could have done the following as well instead of a for loop. But thats a lot of extra code for nothing:   >>> total = 0>>> english = [70 75 80]>>> >>> mark = english[0]         # which is  mark = 70>>> total = total + mark>>> >>> mark = english[1]         # which is  mark = 75>>> total = total + mark>>> >>> mark = english[2]         # which is  mark = 80>>> total = total + mark>>> >>> total225  And as we learned awhile ago the names of variables should try to describe the actual content. So using char = 70 or banana = 70 for this example wouldnt be such a great idea. Although it could be fun. :)  , Unresolved,1

Wednesday September 25th 2013 8:29 pm -04:00,Heres mine: http://pastebin.com/HteMmTHZI few differences I noticed...I re-used one of the functions instead of using len(). Probably len() was better in this case? But it looks like:  return get_length(dna1) > get_length(dna2)  Also used in to get a Boolean so it looked like:  return dna2 in dna1  Anyone else use a string to get a complement? Saved a couple lines of code and it looks like:      i = 0    complements = ATACGC    for char in complements:        if nucleotide == char:            return complements[i + 1]        i += 1  , Pinned Approved Resolved,1

Or simply write your own macros if youre familiar with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).Not sure how elaborate your patient data is? But it sounds to me like you should be using something like an Excel spreadsheet or an Access database. Or the equivalent if youre not using Microsoft Office. Once the data is in a spreadsheet or in a database table then you can print or output it to whatever format you want.Word is good for printing letters and text processing. Not so good for storing data as Im sure you know.Hope that helps somewhat but there are also other options out there as Nick suggested.  ,None,0

Friday September 27th 2013 6:19 am -04:00,What happens to those old memory locations depends on a number of things. Usually it has to do with the type of object thats in the memory location. And how a particular program is written as well.Python uses a two-step process to handle memory allocation. It uses what is known as reference counting and garbage collection.Reference counting is easy enough to understand. Take a list for example. The list object itself will count the number of references that are pointing to it. If the count is zero then itll be freed. The problem with reference counting is that sometimes it gets messed up. For example think of a list that references itself where the count can never be zero. This problem is known as reference cycles.So this is where the garbage collector makes its appearance. Its purpose is really to deal with reference cycles. And it does this on a scheduled basis every now and then where it looks to get rid of various objects and to free up memory.Garbage collection itself is handled by the gc module i.e. you can import gc and call help. Objects are considered as 1st 2nd or 3rd generation. More specifically 0 1 and 2. New objects are 1st generation and if they survive the first sweep of a garbage collection then theyre moved to the 2nd generation and so on.Garbage collection though has a certain threshold before its run. If you type the following code youll see it:  >>> import gc>>> gc.get_threshold()(700 10 10)  The way the threshold works is based on object allocations and deallocations. So if theres 700 more allocations than deallocations then the garbage collector will run.Garbage collection as a subject can be quite complicated but heres a few links with much more info:  http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/gc.htmlhttp://www.digi.com/wiki/developer/index.php/Python_Garbage_Collectionhttp://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Modules/gcmodule.c?revision=81029&view=markupEdit: For those interested heres a more updated version of the C module (26 Sep 2013):  http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Modules/gcmodule.c   , Unresolved,3
Friday September 27th 2013 7:40 am -04:00,For those interested heres an example:  >>> import gc>>> gc.get_threshold()(700 10 10)  You can see the threshold for the three generations i.e. its 700 for new objects. So what we can do is create a list object that references itself. This will mess up its reference counting since it can never become zero. Which will then cause it to be a prime candidate for the garbage collector.  >>> def make_reference_cycle():    lst = [ ]    lst.append(lst)>>> gc.get_count()(137 10 2)  Notice the function above creates a list which references itself. The get_count() method shows us the three generations. So all we have to do is call that function over and over to push the new objects above 700...  >>> for x in range(600):	make_reference_cycle()>>> gc.get_count()(0 11 2)  Notice how the garbage collector kicked in. No more 1st generation objects to clean up. One object actually survived and was moved to the 2nd generation. Lets keep going...  >>> for x in range(600):	make_reference_cycle()>>> gc.get_count()(550 11 2)>>> for x in range(600):	make_reference_cycle()>>> gc.get_count()(369 0 3)  Notice the 3rd generation? Interesting how there always seems to be at least one object that survives.Garbage collection in action. :)  , Unresolved,2
Friday September 27th 2013 4:06 am -04:00,Yes theres code.Heres a copy from the lecture and youll notice that theres two parts:  import tkinter.filedialogal_filename = tkinter.filedialog.askopenfilename()al_file = open(al_filename r)al_histfilename = tkinter.filedialog.asksaveasfilename()al_histfile = open(al_histfilename w)  Notice the .askopenfilename() method which is immediately followed by the .asksaveasfilename() method. So theres an Open dialog box which is then immediately followed by a Save As.You could run this code yourself if you want. Just create a blank .txt file so that you have something to open and youll get a good idea of how everything works.  , Unresolved,0

Friday September 27th 2013 9:50 pm -04:00,Seems to me that the extra lines of code you added are the problem:  for line in a1_file:    print(line)  Reading lines in a file is like a one-shot deal. If you read and print the lines in the console then you cant read them again later on in the program. This has the effect of trying to read an empty file and consequently writing to an empty file. Which looks like Tk just hangs.So comment out the above code & run it again. It will at the very least not cause the reading of an empty file.  , Resolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 9:06 am -04:00,The .readlines() and .read() methods are part of the io module:  http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/io.htmlThe io module is a bit complicated since a lot of methods are inherited from base classes that are higher up in the hierarchy. And these inherited methods may actually be overridden in the current class as well.So you could do this by starting at the top and try to find what youre looking for:  >>> import io>>> help(io)At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class IOBase...  Or you could check out what sort of object you created by starting at the bottom:  >>> file = open(temp.txt r)>>> file<_io.TextIOWrapper name=temp.txt mode=r encoding=cp1252>>>> help(io.TextIOWrapper)Help on class TextIOWrapper in module io...>>> help(io.TextIOWrapper.readlines)Help on method_descriptor:readlines(...)    Return a list of lines from the stream...  If you read the help on TextIOWrapper youll notice that the method resolution order goes from TextIOWrapper to TextIOBase to IOBase and finally to builtins.object at the top.And that the method .readlines() is inherited from IOBase. So you could do this as well:  >>> help(io.IOBase.readlines)Help on method_descriptor:readlines(...)    Return a list of lines from the stream.        hint can be specified to control the number of lines read: no more    lines will be read if the total size (in bytes/characters) of all    lines so far exceeds hint.  Hope that helps somewhat.  , Unresolved,1
Saturday October 5th 2013 9:17 am -04:00,And help on a file object does work.You just need to make sure that youve created the object. For example:  >>> file = open(temp.txt r)>>> help(file)Help on TextIOWrapper object:class TextIOWrapper(_TextIOBase) |  Character and line based layer over a BufferedIOBase object buffer....>>> help(file.readlines)Help on built-in function readlines:readlines(...)

And more specially a Paas (platform as a service).Heroku is like one step above your traditional web host that just uses a web server and maybe a database such as Apache MySQL etc. With cloud platforms it really gets into the application side of things as Debashis has shown with Python.Heres some other notable cloud platforms for example:  Google App Engine - https://developers.google.com/appengine/Amazon Web Services - http://aws.amazon.com/BungeeConnect - http://www.bungeelabs.com/  ,None,2
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 5:58 am -04:00,Yes its possible. But it all depends on your ISP (Internet Service Provider).Some ISPs allow you to purchase a static IP address from them. Or you may already have a static IP address and its just a matter of routing incoming traffic to the port where your web server is located.Big word of caution though not all ISPs allow their subscribers to host a web server. Some even block certain ports and it may even be a violation of your agreement to host a web server.Edit: You can also use a dynamic IP address as well. But again that might violate your agreement.  ,None,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:18 am -04:00,Nick yes those are all possibilities.But there are a lot of things to consider if youre going to self-host for example:   usually upload speeds are not as fast as download speeds which can make your site appear to be very sluggish especially if your web pages are quite big. Or a lot of users at the same time.what about power outages? Do you have a backup system?what about maintenance and the amount of time that you have to take your site offline?So running your own web server is not always the best solution.

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 8:48 am -04:00,Saying Python is not fast because its an interpreted language is kind of a misnomer. Usually theres very little code that actually gets interpreted since Python is more like the glue which holds or binds everything together as is so often mentioned but never really understood.Its like a high-level language which sits on top of other low-level languages such as C for example. So yes itll be slow if you use a for loop that counts a string of a million characters. But thats not the way someone should be using Python and the very reason as to why all these pre-compiled built-in functions exist.Also theres quite a lot of Python code thats out there in the so-called professional market and which is used in real-time but that we dont see simply because its hidden or in some sort of backend. This is often the case for places like Google Dropbox and so on.As an example theres a professor on Coursera that teaches quantitative analysis and his firm uses Python at the very backend like all the way at the backend to do portfolio management optimization time series analysis event analysis and so on. But you dont see it because its coupled with various other software and everything communicates through JSON objects. So someone using the actual software just sees an HTML5 frontend and has no clue that theres even any Python being used.  ,None,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 11:29 am -04:00,New IDs dont get created simply because of new values or new lists. For example if the integer 6 already exists then a new ID wont be created. What happens instead is one two or three different items will simply all point to the same location.Whats more important in this question is to follow whats happening with i. Youll notice that in the for loop it gets assigned the values of 0 3 6 due to the step parameter of 3.So plug in those values for i and then look at the corresponding indexes and their values to see whats being added up. And subsequently put into the merged list.  Edit: Short answer no new ID for 6 because it already existed. New ID14 because integer 15 didnt exist.  , Unresolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 9:12 pm -04:00,Judi very nice find.Are you sure this is your first exposure to programming? I dont even think that experienced programmers would have spotted that one LOL. :)There does seem to be an error in the book if you ask me. Seems to me that theyre making the assumption that the shorthand version for assigning variables is the same as the regular assignment version but its not. For example: appointments = appointments + [16:30]appointments += [16:30]  So what ends up happening with a regular assignment is that a new object gets created as expected. But with the shorthand version its different in that the existing object gets modified instead.Heres some code in the Visualizer to see the difference in action. Also notice Im printing out the ID and that there is indeed a new list for the first one. But with the shorthand version it simply gets modified i.e. just like the append method:  Code in Python Visualizer And heres some documentation that explains the difference between the two: http://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/simple_stmts.html#augmented-assignment-statementsAn augmented assignment expression like x += 1 can be rewritten as x = x + 1 to achieve a similar but not exactly equal effect. In the augmented version x is only evaluated once. Also when possible the actual operation is performed in-place meaning that rather than creating a new object and assigning that to the target the old object is modified instead.  , Unresolved,1

Thursday October 3rd 2013 2:56 am -04:00,To answer your question Python doesnt know that you are doing a for loop over the index as opposed to just a normal for loop. It doesnt even know when youre doing a normal for loop either. The only thing that Python knows is that its doing a loop and thats it. So when you think about it its really up to us to structure the loop so that it produces what we need. Heres an example...The moment Python sees the for statement it knows that its suppose to go into a loop. And thats the only thing it knows. What next? Well Python knows that it has to grab the first thing thats inside whateverfollows the in keyword such as:    for thing in team:     # which could also be written as...for thing in [Dave Bob Joe Mike]:  So we get thing = Dave thing = Bob thing = Joe etc. as the loop keeps going around. Now to create a loop thats going to be used for indices what do we need? Is s[Dave] going to work or how about s[Mike]. No none of those will work. They dont even make any sense. Obviously what we needis a bunch of numbers. Ideally numbers that go from 0-9 1-5 or whatever. And it would look something like this instead:    for thing in [0 1 2 3 4]:     # which could also be written as...for thing in range(5):   So we now get thing = 0 thing = 1 thing = 3 etc. Much better!Which is like saying s[thing] or s[0] s[1] s[2] etc. Notice any real difference between the two loops? Thats right there is no difference except for the fact that if were going to be working with indices then we need numbers.Hope this put you back on track.  , Resolved,3
