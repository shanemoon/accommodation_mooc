Tuesday September 10th 2013 1:21 am -04:00,I have been trying to solve the a1py assignment and i cant get a head through. It is only the a1_gui.py that is opening and when it opens it only display 4 different clock with its hour minutes and seconds timers missing and also a black screen pops out immediately saying get_hours is missing in a1.py get_minutes is missing in a1.py and get_seconds is missing in a1.py. I dont know how to go about solving these problem. I need a guide line on how to solve assignment1 as assignment2 has already been pasted, Resolved,0
