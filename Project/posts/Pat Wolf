Thursday August 29th 2013 3:04 pm -04:00,Use BEDMAS Brackets Exponents Division Multiplication Addition Subtraction for the order in which they have to be done.  I suppose people from other places might want to change the B to a P as some people use a fancy name for brackets lol ;-).  That is the way that a calculator will do it too.  So if you want to force it to do the addition and/or subtraction first then you have to put those numbers in brackets while also keeping the numbers in the same order that they gave you in the problem.  So they want you to add first so the two numbers that need to added have to be put in brackets then they want you to subtract so the two number that need this operation need to be put in brackets and this time it is very important to maintain the correct order because 2 - 7 is not the same as 7 - 2 ;-).  Finally the results of these two sums have to be divided and again the order is very important :-).  hth., Resolved,2
Friday August 30th 2013 4:05 am -04:00,Yes it means an exponential change :-).  The acronym could also be BIDMAS with the I as Indices if that makes it easier to remember or theres BODMAS but I cant for the life of me remember what the O stands for :-O its always the powers though ;-).Ive just finished University level 1 maths so Im glad somethings stuck lol ;-)., Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 1:35 pm -04:00,I agree.  It seems odd to be given an explanation when we get the answer correct but no guidance at all when we get it wrong :-O.  I cant say as I need much of an explanation when I get it right (unless I guessed lol ;-)) but I really need clear guidance when I get it wrong :-/.  This is especially important when the answer requires our input rather than a multi-choice question which we can get to the correct answer by a process of elimination ;-).

Saturday September 7th 2013 8:36 am -04:00,I dont think its so much Coursera to blame Leea as the individual courses :-/.  Although I do think that it is probably up to Coursera to impose standard terminology instead of letting individual courses have free choice.  This is the first time Ive seen them called exercises they are usually called quizzes but Ive also seen them called homework.  I think it would help if there was consistency across Coursera courses and they all called them the same thing probably quizzes as that seems to be more widely used IME but just pick one and stick to it so students know where theyre up to ;-).  Its about learning the course materials not different ways of using the same system.  Id also like to see consistency of the left-hand menu bars too as it seems an unnecessary waste of time having to keep searching it to find what youre looking for when youre doing multiple courses :-/.  Assignments are usually called peer graded assignments but as these arent peer graded assignments is fine :-).I hope they sort it out for you Leesa (and all the others in this situation) as these Coursera courses do tend to be action packed and it can be quite difficult to keep up at the best of times ;-).,None,1

Wednesday September 18th 2013 4:18 am -04:00,Can somebody please check that there is actually one of these that will work because I dont think Ive been given a correct option :(.  They all print out the entire playlist for me    while playlist.count(song) > 3:        playlist.remove(song)     while playlist.count(song) > 3:        playlist.pop(playlist.index(song))     while playlist.count(song) > 3:        playlist.pop(song)     while playlist.count(song) > 3:        playlist.remove(playlist.index(song)), Resolved,1
Wednesday September 18th 2013 5:44 am -04:00,Thanks Bernardo :-).  I think I might just leave it blank as that way Ill only lose the points for not identifying the correct one whereas if I choose the wrong one then I lose points for both ;-).  I wonder if itll let me do that lol ;-).  Ill give it another half an hour then thats it!, Resolved,2

Friday September 27th 2013 9:32 am -04:00,Theres something wrong with what youre telling it to do when the number of letters in the word is between 9 and 10 inclusive.  Its defaulting back to zero.  I cant believe that Ive actually done that bit :-O.  Turned out to be quite smooth sailing for me for a change :-O.  Now off to reward myself by cleaning the bathroom :-/., Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 9:35 am -04:00,Oh and it looks like its including 3 in the zero range in the first instance.  Im guessing that you put <=3 so less than or equal to 3 so you could either change that to 2 or get rid of the = sign ;-)., Resolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 2:53 pm -04:00,Granted Im quite new to Coursera but Ive not come across a bad teacher here yet :-D.  Theyve all had their own styles but theyve all been really enthusiastic about their subjects.  It must be quite challenging to engage students and make them want to keep coming back for more.  Its not like real life where they could have a quiet word with us if they thought that we needed a bit more motivation.,None,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 6:52 am -04:00,If your comment 13 hours ago was directed at me then I wasnt suggesting that you arent motivated Shannon I was actually talking to Shreyash and pointing out that all Coursera teachers (that Ive come across) are good not just Jen and Paul.  None of my comment was directed at you and Ive no idea what others have said to you :-O.  I just think that it is a really difficult job to teach us when they dont know us and cant see us face-to-face.  If we were in a classroom with them then theyd know who was struggling and what with and how to help.  I agree that this course is very difficult for an absolute beginner and I know I wouldnt have been able to cope with it but for the kind help from other students like Tom Alain Anonymous Nick and the others.  And only working part time helps too ;-).  Im coming to the conclusion that for me this isnt a subject that is best suited to distance learning :-/.,None,1
Tuesday October 1st 2013 10:33 am -04:00,Thats ok Shannon I know we can come across as a bit abrupt at times if youre not used to us where I come from ;-) which is why I like to use a lot of smilies lol ;-).  I never set out to cause offense its just a talent I have lol ;-).,None,1
Thursday October 3rd 2013 9:15 am -04:00,Awe thanks Shannon (blushing smilie ;-)).A funny story about the way forum comments attach themselves to the wrong posts.  Last year on my University forum one girl told me how she always looked forward to reading my post because they were so entertaining and always made her laugh.  Her next post was OMG that was supposed to attach to your other post not the one about your mum dying :-O.  Poor Stacey she was mortified!  Sorry Ill get mi coat ;-).  (my mum always like to have a laugh so she wouldnt be offended).Some computer programmer could do with coming up with a forum format where the comments attach themselves to the posts they were talking to like a mind-map kind of thing :-).,None,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 8:06 am -04:00,The only stupid question is the one that you dont ask for fear of looking stupid ;-).Im not the right person to be answering this as Im really struggling but my take on it would be that you could use char instead of mark but not instead of total :-/.  So I think you could have:   for char in english         total = total + charBut I think that mark might be a bit more user friendly as its more descriptive of what its all about :-).  Hope Im on the right track and havent confused anything further :-/., Unresolved,3
Wednesday September 25th 2013 8:46 am -04:00,This whole course is making me feel stupid :-/.  The videos make it look so easy and then when I have to do it on my own I just dont know where to start :-O.  I remember my dad teaching me to ride a bike when I was a kid he used to run behind me holding the saddle and every time I realised hed let go of the saddle Id fall off :-O.  Sometimes Id have gone 100 yards riding on my own before I noticed he wasnt even running behind me :-O and then Id fall off again :-(.  Watching the videos is like theyre holding the saddle but when I come to do it on my own I just fall off again :-(.  Sometimes I think its not as hard as Im making it but Ive spent a few hours now trying to figure out where to start with assignment 3 theyve definitely let go of my saddle for that one :-/., Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 9:31 am -04:00,There is a partner one to this one but I dont know if theyre running it again.  Ive got it in my watch list heres the whatsit:https://www.coursera.org/course/programming2Im not sure whether Ill do it or not even if they do offer it again :-/.  At the moment Id say not but once things start working and going right I tend to change my mind ;-).  I think Im going to have to have a 3rd watch of this weeks videos as Im not getting it at all this week :-(. I dont really understand what were supposed to be doing with that Flanders file or why wed want to do anything to it :-/.  I feel like I dont really understand what programming is even for let alone how to do it :-O.  Mine you my husband did come home with a dose of the man-flu and was kind enough to share so maybe having a wooly head isnt helping :-/., Unresolved,1
Friday September 27th 2013 12:19 pm -04:00,I can guarantee it Rick lol ;-).  I tried the Rice Python course last year and couldnt keep up.  The best thing was having access to other students work during peer assessment but some of the comments about how mine didnt work and I shouldnt bother were quite upsetting :-(.  Im doing 4 courses atm with another 1 starting on Monday and another the week after :-O.  I still dont think Im ready for it yet and I think I need it to be my only course so maybe next year ;-).  Good luck with it the instructors are lovely :-D., Unresolved,0

Friday September 27th 2013 4:09 am -04:00,Tom what would we do without you :-O.  Im so glad youre on this course with us :-D.This learning to programme lark is very time-consuming and frustrating :-/.  Ive just finished the Computer Networks course and they gave us weekly review questions to help us with the weekly quizzes.  I really think that we would benefit enormously from something like that here :-).  We would then be able to discuss these questions openly and we wouldnt feel quite as much like were struggling through this alone :-(.  I think its probably a learning process that we all have to go through because Ive seen pretty much char for char what looks like my code posted here by other students who then get the exact same errors that I got :-O.  Its comforting to see that it makes me feel less stupid :-/.  But I also feel like Im just throwing enough * against the wall that enough of it sticks to get me the points I wonder if Im truly learning anything.  Its as clear as mud most of the time but every now and then Ill understand a bit of something :-).  Theres a poster on the Internet at the moment the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome erm no thats the definition of programming lol ;-)., Unresolved,1
Friday September 27th 2013 6:16 am -04:00,Thanks Tom :-).  If I havent thrown this stupid Idle Python through the window before the end of the course I probably will continue ;-).  Im booked on one with FutureLearn starting next year should give me enough time to recover lol ;-) and get some new reading glasses because I think Im seeing either too many or not enough brackets stupid Idle Python keeps shouting at me for that :-/.  I was shocked (and pleased) to discover that once Id got my row and column to work properly that what Id done first for the board_contains_word_in_column was right :-O.  I thought that looked like the easiest part but of course it wouldnt test until Id done the other bit.  Im glad I dont have to mess with that :-).  So now for the board_contains_word :-)., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 4:54 pm -04:00,Ill second that nomination ;-).  I dont always fully understand what hes trying to tell us straight away but it must be so difficult for him and the rest of the knowledgeable helpful students and TAs alike to be able to help and stay within the honour code :-).  It must be quite frustrating for them all at times when they see our (virtual) blank faces staring back at them lol ;-).  But Im so glad that they keep trying to help us :-D., Unresolved,1

Thursday September 26th 2013 7:23 pm -04:00,Id guestimate that the weekly exercises are taking me about 3-5 hours of solid work but it could be more :-/.  Its usually 24 hours after I first look at it and get started before I input my first attempt :-O.  I need a lot of time to mull it over and wonder where to start.  I tend to panic if I feel under pressure like in a timed exam :-/.  Ive only ever got an exercise right first time once!  , Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 7:44 am -04:00,Dont forget that if the word length is over 10 letters then its 3 points and that those points are per letter.  So in the example of an 8 letter word that they gave us it gives 16 points.I did it from the bottom up so I guess it could be done either way ;-)., Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 7:35 am -04:00,Im at exactly the same place and Ive no idea where to start with these last two functions :-/.  Its taken me a lot more than 8 hours to get this far though I think :-/.  I feel like I havent learnt anything much either but then reading the forum where other students are struggling with the same things I was struggling with and reading the helpful advice from the knowledgeable ones I can see what theyre saying now whereas I couldnt make heads nor tails of what they said before Id managed to complete it :-O.  The next problems still as clear as mud to me but that mud isnt quite as thick now ;-).  Hang in there its a tough learning experience but weve come too far to give up now :-).  I think Im going to leave it for a little while and work on my other course instead.  Its a beautiful sunny day here :-O so I might even go and sit outside and do absolutely nothing this afternoon :-D.Good luck for the final week or two :-)., Unresolved,1
Sunday September 29th 2013 6:54 pm -04:00,I agree more scaffolding would be good :-).  Id say make the course last twice as long with the same amount of graded work releasing the videos fortnightly instead of weekly and providing some practice exercises for us to work on together in the forums before we go on to doing the real for marks exercises :-).  , Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 11:33 am -04:00,Are these the only 11 errors you have?  If so it looks to me like you have 26/37 am I correct?  There is something to click on to the left that opens up a box with more information in it.  I dont know as Im no good at this myself but it looks to me like youre close and that figuring out what the problem is will sort most of it :-).  I think this because the errors seems to be spread over a variety of functions rather than limited to just the one or two.  I bet if you go back and check that everything works as its supposed to and you find out which bit isnt quite doing all you expect of it then youll have cracked it :-D.  I think its probably something near the beginning since its affecting a lot of the other functions down the line :-).  Good luck finding it :-)., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 11:38 am -04:00,Speaking as someone who took three days to get 17/37 thats a pretty good start lol ;-).These indentation errors are a pain and I wont pretend to understand them but if thats all it is then I think Id be inclined to just start from scratch with a new copy of what they gave us and type it all up from the beginning and see if that works :-/.  At the very least then youd have another copy on which to play around if it doesnt work ;-)., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 5:23 pm -04:00,I dont really understand whats going on with this or what its purpose is :-(.  I followed along with what Paul did in the video and everything worked just as it did for him when I was doing exactly what he did but when it comes to doing anything else Im at a loss.  I managed to open the word list file by going through that same long process.  I saw the crunchy cows eating the grass and I think Im supposed to make that appear in a list instead of in a row with the  things showing but nothing I do seems to make a difference :-(.  I dont know how to make it just appear in the shell without going through that long convoluted way of opening it up.  Paul said at the beginning of the video that you could just open the file if it was in the same directory but didnt tell us how :-(.  Im also not getting how we manipulate stuff in the idle for this and then see it done in the shell by running it :-(.  Ive written something for both functions but Ive no idea how to play around with them in the shell and see what they do.  I submitted it just on the off chance and I actually got 1 point for the first one (31/37 now) but I dont know what needs changing or how to even see exactly what it is that I have done :-(.  I think I might leave it now until after the next lot of videos come out tomorrow night and see if they might shed some light on the matter.  I might even leave it until after Ive done the exam ;-).  Maybe Ill have an epiphany between now and next week :-/., Unresolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:25 pm -04:00,I was invigilating a none calculator mock GCSE maths exam yesterday and a few of them turned up with their calculators.  Tomorrow Im invigilating the calculator mock GCSE maths exam and I wonder how many of them will forget their calculators :-/.  The school has only got ordinary non-scientific calculators so I hope they dont forget them :-/.  I dont think that its possible to ensure that everyone knows the rules all you can do is make the best effort to try to ensure it :-/.  I did an exam at my University a couple of years ago where we were provided with 3 articles to read before the exam so that we could familiarise ourselves with the papers beforehand and we were asked questions about these articles in relation to course concepts.  So you could centre your revision around what questions you though they might ask you during the exam.  There were quite a few students complaining about how long it had taken them to read those articles during the exam because they hadnt realised that theyd been provided to us weeks beforehand :-O.  I do think that as students we have a responsibility to ensure that we familiarise ourselves with what needs to be done but its always sad to hear of instances when it all went horribly wrong :-(. , Resolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:42 pm -04:00,I dont know about this exam but for other Coursera exams Ive taken when you click start a timer starts counting down and it doesnt matter what you do that wont stop.  You can only submit it once so dont click submit until youre sure.  Ive read that you should save your work periodically but I dont know how that works I dont know if that means that if you lose connection or something before the 3 hours are up then your work will be submitted automatically when the timer runs out.  It would  be good if that is the reason behind doing that :-)., Resolved,1

Saturday October 5th 2013 10:37 am -04:00,I too have 75% for the assignments and exercises but I decided to spend the 3 hours doing the exam anyway because I think its a way to judge just how much I really have learnt from this course :-).  The result doesnt matter either way but it will show how much I got out of the course I think :-/.  I feel that I have only got full marks prior to the exam because of the number of hours I put into working hard on the various projects but the exam is a true test of mettle.  So why not go ahead and do it anyway its only 3 more hours and you never know you might get full marks for that too :-D., Resolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 10:53 am -04:00,I thought that the exercises were good practice for the assignments :-).  In the exercises I always tried to see if I could understand and predict what they were going to do before I put them into Idle to check it out.  Mostly I was right but not always and sometimes the results were a total shock :-O.  If there are plans to change the assessment then I would say to keep the exercises but make them as not part of the assessment more use them as a practice ground where students could discuss the problems fully and openly.  I think that enabling more discussion about coding problems would make the course more user-friendly for total newbies :-).,None,0
