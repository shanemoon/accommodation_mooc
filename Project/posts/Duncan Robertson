Wednesday September 11th 2013 2:59 pm -04:00,The term or variable banana or char dont actually mean anything.banana or char or anything else you wish to use can be used to represent an internal variable only used in the function. You could use anything you like but if it is meaningful then it is easier to understand later on what you were trying to achieve.E.g. y = Pythonfor x in y:       print (Hello World!)Would produce;Hello World!Hello World!Hello World!Hello World!Hello World!Hello World!Changing x into banana;for banana in y:       print (Hello World!)produces exactly the same result.In the second assignment I have a function that passes a string value and I refer to it within the function as nucleotide. Which is long-winded for sure but it makes it easy to see what it is supposed to represent.Have a play with The Python Visualizer to see if it makes it any clearer, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:49 pm -04:00,Im not sure you have understood the term complentaryReferrring to the assignment problem domain (?)The nucleotides in one strand are bonded to the nucleotides in the other strand. A and T can be bonded together and thus complement each other; similarly C and G are complements of each other.and...Thus given the DNA sequence ACGTACG its complementary strand is TGCATGC.So A should retun T and vice-versa C complenents G and vice versa.Your code equates A to C which is wrong. And so are the rest of the conditionals., Resolved,3
Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:52 pm -04:00,.... with my previous response in mind.If your first function is wrong the second wont work either as it uses the same function.Fortunatley this means you may only have to correct the first function to sort them both out., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:20 pm -04:00,Are we supposed to use error trapping in our functions. It isnt mentioned on the assignment in the areas I am having failures reported when the assignment is submitted.I have defined the function get_complementary_sequence and within it I check for an empty string  and also if there are any non-capitalized or incorrect capital letters.I get all the expected results from the function. However when I submit the assignment I am getting a Failure report;Method Description:Have you tested your function on a zero-length sequence?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorNo sequence entered != - No sequence entered+  : Have you tested your function on a zero-length sequence?Entering;get_complementary_sequence() is set to produce an error message No sequence enteredI cannot see what the problem is and as you can only submit the assignment it is taking a long time to change it incrementally to see what it is the automatic checking routine doesnt like., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 5:19 pm -04:00,Ill try taking out the error check and resubmit it - I have a feeling you may be right!, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 5:05 pm -04:00,Well taking out the blank sequence check was the problem - it may be counter-intuitive but a black sequence () is a valid input.Thanks for the help., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:26 pm -04:00,This is the Failure report I am getting when the assignment is submited;student: test_a2.TestIsValidSequence.test_is_valid_sequence_invalid_capital_letterFAILURE[x]Method Description:Have you tested your function with an invalid capital letter?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorTrue is not false : Have you tested your function with an invalid capital letter?However when I check the function with an invalid capital letter it returns False as I would expect. Are we supposed to produced another error message?So I cant fix the problem as I cant see that there is any problem when I test it from the console.Can anyone see where I may be going wrong?, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 5:21 pm -04:00,I think it may be a RETURN statement at the wrong indent - but will have to wait until I can resubmit  the assignment again; fingers crossed., Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 5:03 pm -04:00,I found my issue(s) to be; 1. checking for a empty input - it should return true. 2. a indent for a RETURN that had moved during an edit. 24/24 marks now - which is nice!, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 5:04 pm -04:00,Thanks for the positive help with this - much appreciated., Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 2:24 pm -04:00,So having selected my answers to question 2 in the quiz I get an incorrect statement back.When I try the answers in Idle my answers come back correct and the answers in the quiz are incomplete.i.eStatements referring to 24:>>> temperatures = [18 20 22.5 24]>>> temperatures [-1]24>>> temperatures [4]Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#2> line 1 in     temperatures [4]IndexError: list index out of range>>> temperatures [3:][24]>>> temperatures [3:4][24]>>> Apparently only  temperatures[-1] is correct but as can be seen above so is temperatures[3:] and temperatures [4].Unless someone else knows different...... , Resolved,10
Monday September 16th 2013 3:00 pm -04:00,Ah I see.Thanks for that., Resolved,2
