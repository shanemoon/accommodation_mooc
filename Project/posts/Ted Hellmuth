Monday September 2nd 2013 11:48 am -04:00,After several frustrating days of trying to penetrate the easiest part of the assignment Step 2 I finally was able to present my first go. I waited tremulously (really I was trembling metaphorically) to see what response I would get.This is what I got:SubmissionSubmission timeMon-02-Sep 09:11:16Raw Score0.00 / 41.00FeedbackAutotesting (Version 0.0.14)Report was generated in: 14:11:17 - 02/09/2013Summary: Test results statistics - All=8; Errors=8; Failures=0; Successes=0; Warnings=0.

I am too confused to have any neuronal response. If I had good sense Id just chuck it in but Im starting to see this as a challenge. Does anyone have any suggestions?My submission which I submitted in a file titled a1sec.py consisted of the code fragment copied  from the first 60% of page 1 of a1.py inserted into a blank Python Idle 3.3.2 screen crowned by a brilliant return statement consisting of a very simple operation.Does anyone have any helpful suggestions?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 12:02 pm -04:00,OliverI called it a1sec.py because it is just Step 2. If I save my step 2 answer as a1.py it would overwrite thereby destroying the existing a1.py which I need for the rest of the assignment. Wouldnt it? Where am I going wrong?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 2:10 pm -04:00,JeffWhen you submitted it that way did you pass Step 2?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 2:26 pm -04:00,JoseThanks. Ill give it a go.Ted, Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 3:05 pm -04:00,JoseYour good advice got me two points inestimably better than the lowly zero I had before. This is the first positive reinforcement Ive had in days. Somehow I think there must still be something wrong with the Step 2 code I submitted but the report back is unclear to me as to how much of the problem is my answer to Step 2 and how much is attributable to the steps I have not yet attempted. Do you have any ideas on this?, Unresolved,0
