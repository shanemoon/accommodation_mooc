Wednesday August 21st 2013 3:14 pm -04:00,The problem summary: There are two version of the exercise which I noticed. On on version the question said that round() is wrong the other says its right with nothing in the explanation about why that would be so. Since I only have 2 attempts left on my exercise I want to know if this is a bug or Im missing something?Steps to reproduce:Screenshot:,None,0

Thursday September 5th 2013 3:01 pm -04:00,Im simply typing the code into Shell giving eggs a value then proceeding with writing the code thats given in the assignment. I write out the if statement put a (:) at the end. Then IDLE automatically indents for you. However when I write the return statement and press enter Im getting a SyntaxError:SyntaxError: return outside functionWhen the return statement is clearly indented. Can anyone think of what i might be doing wrong?, Unresolved,2
Thursday September 5th 2013 3:17 pm -04:00,the problem is the return statement is within the if statement. Its indented and looks exactly how it looks on the exercise example but IDLE is telling me theres a syntax error., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 3:50 pm -04:00,Ok Im having trouble connecting functions together. Im having trouble putting together the contains_sequence. I thought I had it but then it either both examples pull out true or they both show false.I know the find statement gives me the location of the first occurrence of the sequence. So by using the find statement only the function gives back those location (or lack thereof). I know turning a function into a boolan statement you get the True/False return however to set it == dna2 you get false because a str doesnt match an int. Ive tried various loop and if statements and cant get those to work either. I am so close to figuring it out but cant seem to final the right process. Cant anyone point me in the right direction I know this is easier than Im making it which is why Im frustrated. , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 4:26 pm -04:00,I can see how you might change that using and if statement but Im trying to find the single line way., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 4:43 pm -04:00,Was a lot simpler than I even thought. For anyone else who might be struggling. I did an if statement with a boolan expression and then simplified it to a one liner using only things we have learned from lecture. I used one thing from last weeks video lecture as well., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 4:27 pm -04:00,I did see something by using dir(str) but I dont know how to use it. As it listed Help on wrapper_descriptor which we havent used in lecture yet. Unless Im missing something., Resolved,0
