Wednesday September 25th 2013 4:33 pm -04:00,It seems to me that it is impossible to write one line expression for this question. I wrote three line expression that correctly evaluates the word in IDLE. However I used range() and len() functions to iterate through negative indexes. Range() and len() of course use parentheses but I can not figure out other ways to iterate through negative indexes. I did not use addition subtraction and other functions with parentheses. Why the grader rejects my solution?Addition. My expression also uses print() function., Resolved,0
