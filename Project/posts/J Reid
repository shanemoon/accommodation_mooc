Thursday August 22nd 2013 12:59 pm -04:00,I think that phi should be defined explicitly--Python doesnt seem to recognize it as a built in constant at least for me. And I think that short of using built in sqrt the square root of 5 should be something like 5**(1/2) rather than as written; and phi**n instead of (phi)^n etc.. Finally I think theres a semantic error with parentheses--Dont we want something like                    ( (phi)**n-(1-phi)**n)/(5**(1/2)) ?And phi=(1+✓5)/2 (Note the parentheses).,None,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 6:06 pm -04:00,I guess I am adrift here too. The obvious ( to me) response here uses 0 as an index but we are explicitly asked to restrict ourselves to positive indices. An attempt using positive indices only plus a little arithmetic was incorrect. Id be interested in others experience. Thanks., Resolved,1
Monday September 23rd 2013 7:03 pm -04:00,I agree--things are simple if we may use 0 as an index. But I think we are directed to use positive indices only???Given numbers = [[1 2] 3 [4 5]] give an expression using indexing (with positive indices) on numbers that evaluates to 4., Resolved,1

Friday September 27th 2013 1:08 pm -04:00,Actually the whole thing would have been cleared up for me had the question specified non-negatve indices rather than positive ones. This is done in many other instances. So I think perhaps it was a slip-up on the part of the proposer., Resolved,0
