Saturday September 14th 2013 11:06 pm -04:00,My husband showed me how to trace a problem in the Week 4 exercise.digits = 0123456789result = 100for digit in digits:    result = result - int(digit)print(result)Go through the for statement by hand.1. Input = 0result = 100 - 02. Input = 1result = 100-13. Input = 2result = (100-1)-2 = 974. Input = 3result = (100-1-2-3) = 94and so on going through all the way to 9. Â It really helped me understand why my answer was right. (And folks I could be totally off on my definition of how to trace; this is just what my husband showed me!), Unresolved,2
