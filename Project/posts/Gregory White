Tuesday August 27th 2013 8:04 am -04:00,PyCharm has a classroom licensing option and I researched a little bit. If the school can fill out the form below I will pay the fee and others can use as well. This is a good opportunity to get a good Python IDE for cheap. Please let me know if the school would be willing to do this.PyCharm is a full featured Python code editor / IDEInformation about PyCharm is here http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/Form for scholastic license is here http://www.jetbrains.com/eforms/resolver.action?licenseRequest=pcCL, Unresolved,2
Tuesday August 27th 2013 12:36 pm -04:00,I know that Idle is more than adequate for this class. My inquiry was aimed at people that want a fully featured IDE  for a great price and want to reap the benefits of being classified as a student while taking this class., Unresolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 7:46 pm -04:00,I could get zero points on final and still pass which takes a lot of pressure off but I will study for several days and give it my best. I think time will be my biggest issue because many times I need to write things out and run then through the visualizer and or see what snippets of code do in the shell. This stuff does not come east to me and just happy to have made it this far (I dropped class last time it was offered and I got a late start)., Resolved,0
