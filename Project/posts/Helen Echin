Friday September 13th 2013 5:18 pm -04:00,s.lower() or s.upper() or s.isdigit()Why does this command execute just the first method?When I create s = Sdf it just makes sdf lowercase and gives this string backwards. Why is it not boolean?, Resolved,0

Monday September 16th 2013 6:45 pm -04:00,And why is it so?Maybe because in the first example we have indexing. And in the second and third example we have slicing? Am i right?, Resolved,2

Wednesday September 18th 2013 2:48 pm -04:00,As I understand this:Ive run this code in visualizer:grades = [60 70]grades = grades.append(80)grades = grades.append(90)grades1st step: assigning variable grades a list [60 70]2nd step: reassigning the variable grades  to grades.append(80). And this construction refers to None. (Actually I dont understand why append returns None). And as a result variable grades  now refers to None.3rd step: Type of None is NoneType so we  receive an error - AttributeError: NoneType object has no attribute append., Unresolved,1

Wednesday September 18th 2013 4:27 pm -04:00,As Ive understand this method makes room always in front.For example we have list [60 70 80 90] and want to add 555.When index is [1] the list would be [60 555 70 80 90]. The index of 555 would be [1].When index is [-1] the list would be [60 70 80 555 90]. The index of 555 would be [-2] not [-1].Am I right?, Unresolved,3

Tuesday September 24th 2013 5:54 pm -04:00,Just now Ive noticed that the floating numbers in visualizer are just marked as floating but represented as numbers.I decided to check what will print our function averages.So I dont know what should be the print statement.Ive tried print(averages(grades))Yes it is printed but the amount of steps is doubled. , Unresolved,0
