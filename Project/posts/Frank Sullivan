Monday August 19th 2013 6:49 pm -04:00,Jimmy how ya doin im from the US i want to get proficient with the code n move on to algorithms n crypto,None,2
Monday August 19th 2013 7:58 pm -04:00,just look at the available ones,None,0
Friday August 23rd 2013 2:44 am -04:00,Hi Olivia: Yeah thx for getting back to me about it! Theres a 2nd course in Python with the same instructors. Its a good idea to take it.  I seriously advise taking the 2 algorithm courses at Princeton too. The crypto courses are taught by Dan Boneh.at Stanford The maths neededat: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/High_School_Mathematics_Extensions/Discrete_ProbabilityThe Crypto I course starts on 9/9 but I wont attempt it w/o the programming background. Theres a lot of algorithm development and coding needed to implement the crypto unless he made it easier! I tried it already but I wasnt ready :-),None,0
Friday August 23rd 2013 8:44 am -04:00,Actually I meant the algo course starting at Stanford in September sorry.... anyway this coursell better work for that one as a prep cuz the Princeton one is in Java.,None,0
Monday August 19th 2013 6:42 pm -04:00,like physics economics sociology.... once ya got a math model ya just go ahead n feed it to the number cruncher and it graphs it in terms we can deal with,None,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 6:52 am -04:00,Still though Vu yer initial post provides an excellent example of how a pointer wont move until you tell it to! Thx! :-), Resolved,0
Thursday August 22nd 2013 12:54 am -04:00,Not so much a feature of language syntax as of how language is converted into machine instructions.Many languages use elements of both.Interpreter:• Takes commands one at a time converts into machine code and executes.• Allows interactive programming at a shell prompt as in Python.• Can’t take advantage of optimizing over a entire program — does not know what instructions are coming next.• Must translate each command while running the codepossibly many times over in a loop.Compiled languageThe program must be written in 1 or more files (source code).These files are input data for the compiler which is a computer program that analyzes the source code and converts it into object code.The object code is then passed to a linker or loader that turns one or more objects into an executable.Why two steps? Object code contains symbols such as variables that may be defined in other objects. Linker resolves the symbols and converts them into addresses in memory.Often large programs consist of many separate files and/or library routines — don’t want to re-compile them all when only one is changed. ,None,0
Monday August 19th 2013 6:56 pm -04:00,no guarantees... just gotta keep workin at mastering one then building on that,None,1
Monday August 19th 2013 8:08 pm -04:00,90 or better... i got one in music and audio engineering,None,-2
Monday August 19th 2013 6:53 pm -04:00,right now its the language of choice on coursera,None,0
Monday August 19th 2013 6:26 pm -04:00,yeah i went in and just answered the the 1st 15 off the top o my head n scored  9. thass like a 60 outa the gate. n what  i got4 more shots!?,None,-11
Monday August 19th 2013 6:35 pm -04:00,sorry dude i dont know where yer from but just ignore me if yer uncomfortable ,None,-9

Wednesday August 21st 2013 2:00 am -04:00,Question 6Content removed as it contains details from the Quizz. Please dont post Quizz questions or answer as this is against the Honour Code. Thanks. -- Byrne GMy question is: to how many decimal places should the answer be??  e.g.:  Integers are typically stored in 4 bytes (32 bits). Valuesbetween roughly −231 and 231 can be stored.In Python larger integers can be stored and will automaticallybe stored using more bytes.$ python>>> 2**301073741824>>> 2**1001267650600228229401496703205376LNote L on end!,None,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 7:58 am -04:00,Thats why its categorized as an OOP language... Much like Java and C++, Resolved,0
Saturday August 24th 2013 5:51 pm -04:00,Were at our computers worldwide... The Python codes punched in... Hit ENTER Then what happens!? I dont care if theres next a prompt or an error its easy to deal with that. Its the total sequence of interim events that Im interested in.Any language is ez to learn. Its how the machine actually deals with it... Hey man it might take 10 different languages to effectively do a job! An army of coders on different chunks of a main program! All fed into a super computer! Have fun! :-),None,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 6:21 am -04:00,So in messing with the following code its seen that x and y both point to the same object!>>> x = (123)   >>> id(x)16498816>>> x[1 2 3]>>> y = x>>> y[1 2 3]>>> y.append(27)>>> y[1 2 3 27]>>> x[1 2 3 27], Unresolved,0
