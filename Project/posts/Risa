Saturday September 7th 2013 12:45 pm -04:00,I think the question is worded badly.  It states:Below are some English statements. Each may be true or may be false. Which English sentence is true exactly when the Boolean expression evaluates to True?Its true when the bool exp evaluates to true at these points: at least 1 passes (true) some pass but not all (true) and all pass (true). Right but..... Technically as soon as it hit the first TRUE that entire expression was true. Thats how OR works.  So it looks like they were looking for the super technical definition. AT LEAST ONE TRUE is needed for the entire OR expression. Therefore the only possible answer is The student passed at least one of the courses.If you look at the QA section for that video that same question was asked this way which is a lot more understandable: Select the sentence(s) that describe the meaning of the expression: (key word is meaning of the expression)Hope this helps., Unresolved,0
