Tuesday August 27th 2013 7:18 am -04:00,Is there something that I dont understand here or is it superfluous to talk about memory address?if:x = 1 (id1)changes to:x = 2 (id2)It doesnt really matter to me that the id changes does it? All I really need to know is that the value of the variable has changed. , Unresolved,1

I find the step 5 instructions very puzzling leaving me guessing as to what it is I am supposed to do here. The descriptions are obviously very detailed but Id much appreciate an assignment statement (no pun intended) saying specifically what is expected of me. I take it that I am expected to write a function that when I input a number of seconds the function calls on each of the get_hours/minutes/seconds functions finally telling me how many hours have elapsed since midnight? Is my assumption correct? , Resolved,0
