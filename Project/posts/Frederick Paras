Monday August 19th 2013 10:00 am -04:00,I am currently having issues when viewing the video lectures. Problem: After my video finishes and I click on the next arrow key it sits idle for a long time. I need to either refresh the screen 2x or click on the back arrow key and click the forward key.  I am using a MAC with OS ( Lion ) Currently using both the FF and Chrome browser.  It is doing it for both.  , Unresolved,0
