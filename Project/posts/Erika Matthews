Tuesday September 3rd 2013 4:56 pm -04:00,I am attempting to complete Assignment 1 made a little effort and sent it in for review but nothing! No heres what you did wrong Nothing! This assignment is due and I am so stressed out! I dont get it but I understand and got the first 2 exercises completely! I dont know what else to do and this is frustrating me so bad im almost considering not to try again and/or unenroll. i even went to look at the exercises and lectures for help but I am still not getting it!, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 5:18 pm -04:00,None really and its frustrating because I understood and got both Exercises 1 and 2 and then this assignment leaves me confused and disheartened about even continuing this course! This assignment is 10%!Â , Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 4th 2013 8:17 pm -04:00,I am doing this for fun and I think I get it this time its just that when I tell the function to return it doesnt. THAT is what makes this frustrating, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 8:18 pm -04:00,I did that and it didn;t return anything at all. Did I mess up somewhere?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 8:06 pm -04:00,Thank You! I will try this assignment again and stay the course., Unresolved,2
Wednesday September 4th 2013 8:21 pm -04:00,The tips are very helpful although I am still having a problem getting the function to return. I wrote it like return hours_difference and even put in the parameters but nothing went through like its not being read. This is happening with anything I tell Python to return! I think I messed up!, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 10:24 pm -04:00,I am not sure the only thing I can think to do is keep trying until something clicks., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 4:35 pm -04:00,Ah! Thank You!, Unresolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 2:25 pm -04:00,Ok so far I think Ive gotten 2 of the 4 codes down. However the if then only if statements are tripping me up. I am not sure how to approach the if and only if coding. Any tips?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 5:27 pm -04:00,I will attempt again thank you!, Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 2:10 pm -04:00,Attempted again and failed! Ugh this course is really getting on my nerves! I wrote the code and tested it out and even showed it. Whats the point of submitting anything and getting no feedback of what went wrong! Its the same thing with the exercises! I practice the questions in IDLE and put the answers down in the homework what turns out wrong in IDLE is graded correct on the assignment and what doesnt work in IDLE or a syntax error is also marked correct? What does work in IDLE is graded as wrong?! AM I missing something here!?!, Unresolved,0
