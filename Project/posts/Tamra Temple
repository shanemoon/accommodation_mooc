Monday August 19th 2013 1:39 pm -04:00,You are anonymous here and using a fictitious name and photo as admin and creator of the FB group. Why did you start the group that way? Id rather see a more transparent group where the owner is clear to all., Resolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 6:31 pm -04:00,Its not philosophy but practicality. You dont even have a legit Facebook account yet rushed to start a group using a fake fb profile/account then asked something like 40k people to open up their email addresses to you by joining your group. We have a forum here. I have joined many coursera fb groups  and this is the first time Ive said one smells fishy. I only post to give ppl fair warning., Resolved,2

Wednesday August 28th 2013 5:33 pm -04:00,Another way to approach it when stuck is to look at the examples with answers we were given in the starter code and ask yourself what would you have to do with the input given to get that output given. And will it work for each one? Try the code you think then run it using a copy and paste for each of the example data. If your answer matches try another test data from the list. Each of the functions has a list of test data and answers. I copied and pasted and tested every one within each function and had to do it again when I changed something in a function that I called from another. , Unresolved,2
Wednesday August 28th 2013 6:14 pm -04:00,I had the same problem and was up until 4:30am trying to find and fix the problem. My eyes were red my brain fried and in a stupor I made a change that fixed it. What a night! (nightmare too). , Unresolved,5
Tuesday September 10th 2013 6:00 pm -04:00,To me too. Im startled that the grader says zero length is valid. Null is not a G C T or A. I came over to the forum to see whats going on with that. I had coded for  but then it was marked wrong with the note that  is valid. , Resolved,3
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:16 pm -04:00,Me too and I agree it is annoying. , Resolved,3
Wednesday September 11th 2013 8:09 am -04:00,Did you test that with strings that include some but not all all of the four and no invalid characters? , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 8:48 pm -04:00,I dont know how to ask about this. I also get the four errors even though my data runs fine in IDLE for the things the feedback says have you tried nnn Despite those messages not giving me clear information about what was wrong I tried to change the code a few times. Each of my submissions have been with the code running fine in IDLE on the data suggested and still result in the four errors. Since we cant submit what weve done and the messages arent giving information about why the code works fine in idle but not on the tests youve created how do we ask what to do about it? Is there some staff who can look at my code and explain why the discrepancy? (edit: looking above I see Etienne said it is ok to post code that doesnt work. Since it works in IDLE but doesnt work for the four tests Ill post it. Please help me understand the problem(s). This is my code (at least the last iteration of code that works in IDLE but not in the submission tests): (code removed... thanks for your help finding the spelling error) , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:37 pm -04:00,Ok Thanks Mr/s Anonymous. Empty long and all four... I dont know how to fix it but appreciate the test data ideas. Maybe some coffee will help then it will come to me.Tom Are you referring to this? If so what is duplicated?[~ep]thanks both of you. Ill be back with coffee and a clearer mind., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 8:03 am -04:00,Yes I missed that snippet last night when I removed code above. Since I thought it didnt work and saw your comment saying broken code was ok to post I posted then removed when it was pointed out that I had a spelling error. Forgot this snippet though and I will be careful. In general I dont even ask for help so probably wont do it again. Others can learn if they read this especially code that works in IDLE is NOT ok to post. It was so frustrating to have the same code NOT work in the tests though and as I originally posted on this thread how do we ask for help? Is there staff who will look at our code off of the board? That was my original question. We need to know how to get that help when its needed. Any ideas?, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:47 pm -04:00,Those tests work so I dont know. :( I didnt change anything and these tests are identical or similar to ones I was using before but I tried them and... have to remind myself theres no crying in programmingor baseball., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:07 pm -04:00,Thanks for the reminder. Since it turned out to be right except for the spelling I did remove it. Etienne said wrong code is ok to post which is why I did. I am so happy you saw the spelling error. Thanks again., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:56 pm -04:00,Nick lol I didnt read the Nick I guess. Sorry about that. Is complementary hard coded into the testing on coursera though? That could explain why my code works in IDLE but not there.  Ill try fixing the spelling and resubmit. Thanks, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:02 pm -04:00,YAY NICK!!! That fixed it. doing the happy dance. 24/24 thank you VERY much. Ill remember how to spell complEment from now on and Im glad to know it wasnt the code that was broken. Good night. Tamra, Resolved,0
