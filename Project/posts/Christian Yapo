Wednesday September 4th 2013 9:40 am -04:00,I have been stuck on step 4 for 2 days. I did the conversion to get minutes and seconds in hours in order to get the results but when i try to run the code I get a  TypeError. Here is an example of what I get: to_float_hours(2 45 9)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#14> line 1 in <module>    to_float_hours(2 45 9)  File C:\Users\Owner\Downloads\a1.py line 55 in to_float_hours    return int + int/60 + int/3600TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: type and int. Please someone help me. That will be truly apreciated, Unresolved,1
