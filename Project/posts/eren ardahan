Tuesday August 27th 2013 5:31 pm -04:00,student: test_get_minutes.TestGetMinutes.test_example_from_handoutMethod Description:Test the example in the handout.Message:FAILURE: AssertionError3 != 63.333333333333336get_minutes(3800) should return the value 3. But according to test program your return value is 63.333333333333336..So you return seconds/3600..This is what you did wrong..you should use integer division (//).This is a simple mistake but also youre missing something else..seconds//3600 returns the value 1..This is equivialant to how many hours in 3800 seconds..get_minutes method should return how many minutes in 3800-3600(1 hour)=200 seconds..(not only 3800I actually mean the parameter).. Hope its helpful..., Unresolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:05 pm -04:00,Did you test your methods..For example get_minutes(3800) should return the value 3..Since 3800 seconds is equivalent to 1 hour 3 minutes and 20 seconds., Unresolved,0
