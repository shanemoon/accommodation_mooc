Friday September 6th 2013 1:26 am -04:00,Matt was there a reason you chose to use terminal rather than IDLE?, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 6:07 pm -04:00,Interesting Id be interested to hear how it goes.  Ive used terminal for years for basic UNIX stuff but tend to prefer applications for usage. Ive been looking at Aptana Studio for code development as well as Text Wrangler/B.B. Edit but am focusing on IDLE for the classwork since that seems preferred., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 5:29 pm -04:00,Ill agree on wonder what the point was.  I read the problem several times noticed the large answer text box thats for writing code and I thought all of this...and the answer is actually what the answer is? The cant be asking for simply that....  And sure enough when I clicked submit I got them right.3 out of 16 questions were devoted to this.  And while its academically interesting to see some of this visualized as we havent even officially covered the difference between global and local variables Im not sure the value other than assumingly familiarizing us with the visualizer for use in debugging larger scripts. , Resolved,1

Monday September 9th 2013 11:39 am -04:00,To further Joses correct answer  Python uses indentation to relate code to a function so anything part of a function after the first line: def function():  needs to be indented the same amount for the interpreter to know its part of the function.Its the same with loops (ie: For statements) and conditionals (if-else), Unresolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 11:28 am -04:00,How strict is the auto-grader in parsing the submitted files?Will it ignore commented out code? I prefer to keep failed code attempts in the file (commented out) to see what Ive tried that didnt work but I dont want to cause issues with the auto grader. (I uploaded a file and it seemed fine but confirmation from folks who know is always good :) ), Unresolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 11:47 am -04:00,In submitting my assignment I had some test failures in the auto-grader.Its Failure message was:Method Description:Test values just after multiples of 60 seconds.Message:FAILURE: AssertionError57 != 9I have since solved the problem with the code but other than telling me there is a problem I didnt find this helpful in tracking down what the problem was. My question is with the 57 != 9Is this simply telling me the grader was expecting 57 and instead got 9  (or 9 and got 57)  or does it mean something else entirely?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 12:21 pm -04:00,Right..I understood the method description was telling me what test failed...it is purely the 57 != 9 part of the message that i am not understanding.But to be sure I understand the 57 != 9 IS SAYING that it was expecting 57 as an answer and got 9 instead (or vice versa), Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 1:25 pm -04:00,A python book Ive been reading used from-import instead of import to bring code in from another file.as in from modulename import *vsimport modulenameIs there a difference between what these two do? Is it a Python 2 vs Python 3 thing (though the book is also teaching Python3)?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 2:47 pm -04:00,It would seem the from module import gives less complicated code...so are there benefits to one or the other?, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 8:46 pm -04:00,I went with the theory well we havent really learned len() yet and the stuff covered in this section has the ways of writing the function so go ahead and do that.Worthwhile learning experience., Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 9:11 pm -04:00,yeah i was debating putting in something to handle those...the autotester doesnt seem to test for it but it made me happy :), Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 2:13 pm -04:00,if you just build a string with the right elements you can use that to test things., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 2:00 pm -04:00,Ok I figured out what this all does and thus the answer...but it took some doing and was really down to breaking the bits down individually and diagramming things out.  I didnt find the visualizer to be of help in this.Other than the brute force method I used was there an easier way to figure this out?, Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 4:24 pm -04:00,As opposed to what is shown in the lecture when Ive written some scripts (mainly AppleScripts) to process something I usually put something to signal mean that the program has run and finished. Some system beeps a message on the screen...something like that. Some kind of feedback that isnt just checking if the file has been written or changed.Is this...good practice or should stuff like that be not done (or depends on preference and needs of the program)?, Unresolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 5:21 pm -04:00,< 2 hours. Really only snag was in read_board. I kept getting out of range index errors. I worked out a solution but i wonder if theres a way to optimize the code., Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 10:21 pm -04:00,@Shreyash I cant decide if the solution I made is elegant or overly-complicated. For most of the code though it just flowed smootly as long as I avoided typos.If I understand the language right  then I got n2 complexity and 9 rows as well. , Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 8:40 pm -04:00,Something that may help everyone is to make a copy of the a3_driver.py file and in it comment out everything but the calls to read_words and read_board leaving:from tkinter.filedialog import askopenfileimport a3# Load the words list.##words_file = askopenfile(mode=r title=Select word list file)##words = a3.read_words(words_file)##words_file.close()### Load the board.board_file = askopenfile(mode=r title=Select board file)board = a3.read_board(board_file)board_file.close()##Use that to call into the functions you write in a3.py. (Youll need to figure out additional code to add to test to see if things are working right... Remember: lack of error message does not always mean correct code., Resolved,1
Friday September 27th 2013 2:34 pm -04:00,Should it be assumed that calls to functions will have valid parameters or should error catching code be used?For example in def make_str_from_row should code be put in to make sure that the index called is in range?It doesnt look like the grader tests out of range calls..., Unresolved,0

Friday September 27th 2013 3:21 pm -04:00,After a bunch of time staring at my code trying to figure out where my logic was failing I discovered this little truism which I hope will help others:When you paste a function from a previous section of your page make sure you are copying the actual function you meant to.For example if you want to past make_str_from_column then dont copy make_str_from_row., Unresolved,2

Tuesday October 1st 2013 11:30 am -04:00,The video (played on the website) keeps freezing at aprox. 1:38.  Is anyone else having this problem?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 1:35 pm -04:00,Nope...I let it load all the way...video still stops after saying the notation is braces. It eventually hits the spinning circles like it was running. Havent seen this with other vids here, Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 12:31 pm -04:00,This is really a question for the more experienced folks...why would you want to use a tuple rather than a list? I dont see the immutability as a particularly good reason to add another data type since you can just not change the list after creating it.So whats the advantage?, Resolved,2
Tuesday October 1st 2013 1:16 pm -04:00,Wouldnt that be more of fronting up a list? :D, Resolved,1
Tuesday October 1st 2013 2:03 pm -04:00,But is there a programming advantage to this over a list? I guess my question is more a question of the fundamentals of the language.  Why was this data type included?Do they make the program run quicker? Processing easier?, Resolved,2
Tuesday October 1st 2013 3:00 pm -04:00,Fahim: Thats perfect information. Answers everything. Thanks!, Resolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 2:00 pm -04:00,The quiz talks about immutable values becoming keys.I guess im not clear on what a mutable value is in this case.Wouldnt when you inverse the list what ever the value was be made an immutable key at that point regardless of what it might be changed to later?Or does this mean it cant be a variable?  (though a quick test in IDLE shows using a variable in a list sets the list index to the value of the variable not the variable itself).>>> dog = beagle>>> lista =[porthos isadog]>>> lista[porthos is a beagle]>>> dog = ninja>>> lista[porthos is a beagle]>>> So what would a mutable value be in this case?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 2:58 pm -04:00,IDLE disagrees with you Tom.The code I posted is a copy and paste from the shell., Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 5:35 pm -04:00,I guess Im missing something...What is a mutable value? A variable put in a list puts the value of the variable into the list. If you later change the variable nothing in the list changes. So while you can go in and change the list afterward you cant do it by just changing the variable.That extends to a value in a dictionary from what i see. Its never mutable or fluid. It is always static until acted upon directly (as opposed to a change flowing from a variable change). If thats the case what is the mutable value the quiz talks about?  , Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 2:19 pm -04:00,In Python does the order that functions are defined in the code matter or does it parse the entire program THEN execute?As an example:def multiarea(height width qnty):     blah blah     return area(height width) * qntydef area(height width):    blah blah blah    return areamultiarea(543)Will this return an error that area() is not defined before multiarea() or does it see everything at once?, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 3:12 pm -04:00,so functions can be in any order but must be defined in code before theyre called?, Unresolved,0
