Instead you want to truncate your numbers so that they always go down (never up) to the nearest whole number.You dont want 1.6 hours to be rounded up to 2 hours; you want it to be considered 1 hour so that you can see the .6 remainder and convert it to minutes and seconds.To learn how to truncate your numbers without rounding Id recommend reviewing the week one operator symbols we learned (* / // %). Good luck--hope it helps!, Unresolved,0
