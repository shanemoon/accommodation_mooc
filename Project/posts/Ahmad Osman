Monday September 16th 2013 1:27 am -04:00,Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not false : Have you tested your function on the examples in the docstring?I had like 5 of these errors and I had no idea what was going on for like 10 minutes. I was returning False as a string and it didnt like that but seemed to have no issues with getting True as string. So I thought it was trying to tell me that False is not False and it should instead be True..?! Anyway I removed the quotes when I realized it should be boolean like the type contract states and it fixed all my mistakes.Anyway just a silly mistake that made me facepalm when I realized what I did wrong + I wanted to share.Kind of off topic but will there be a follow up course to build on the basics taught in this course? Ive really enjoyed it so far. Thanks., Resolved,2
