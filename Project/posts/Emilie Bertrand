Friday August 30th 2013 6:01 pm -04:00,It took me some time also to understand step 6 but its very simple in the end.Dont want to give the answer but you dont need if statements to write these functions.Just think of some basic maths :+- = - (ex: 5+-2 = 5-2 = 3)-- = + (ex : 5--2 = 5+2 = 7), Unresolved,8

Saturday August 31st 2013 6:03 am -04:00,What I did is use a variable to store the result of my calcul then call the function to_24_hour_clock with the variable as parameter and return the result of the function call.You can also do it with a single line of code using the call to function to_24_hour_clock in your return statement with your calcul as a parameter.Hope Im clear enough, Unresolved,1
