Thursday September 26th 2013 2:58 pm -04:00,the implementation of what youve called list_letters is where I was stuck as well.well I ended up googling the problem and found that theres a handy pre-defined function called list which does exactly what list_letters is supposed to do.>>>list(hello)[h e l l o]but I still cannot figure out how exactly this function is working i.e. how you can make it do the same thing by means of a loop.can you give me a hint?, Resolved,0
