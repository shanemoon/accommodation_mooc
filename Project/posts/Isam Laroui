Tuesday October 1st 2013 9:39 am -04:00,Same thing happened to me.Heres hoping that our ingenious and genial professors will find a way to give us a second chance to take a final exam while fully prepared without penalizing the 99.9% of the students who did not do the same careless mistake that we did.Isam., Resolved,-1
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 9:54 am -04:00,Henry says above: The unstoppable clock happens on all timed tests on CourseraI believe that is incorrect. I am currently taking the Mathematical Methods for Quantitative Finance on Coursera and it is my understanding that for the timed quizzes the clock stops when you save your work and exit the browser.I have taken (not always finished admittedly) about 10 classes on Coursera and this is the first time I come across an unstoppable clock situation. That it happened on the most important exam of the class and that it allowed careless people such as myself who out of curiosity and without reading the warnings wanted to know what the final exam looked like is frustrating! That I was doing very well so far and enjoying the class immensely but then that I had to take the final exam before even studying the week 7 material is even more so. Oh well I better get over my frustration and ace the weeks 6 and 7 exercices and the assignment 3 and hope I got at least a couple of correct answers on the final., Resolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 8:31 am -04:00,I just opened the final exam by mistake to see what it was about not knowing that the clock would not stop.It appears that thoughtless act destroyed everything Ive done in this class since the beginning and that I will get 0 on the exam.I have had perfect scores on each and every one of the exercises and the assignments so far.I feel its very unfair and very discouraging.Could you please give me (and others who might have made the same mistake) another chance?Please please please.Isam Laroui, Resolved,-5
Tuesday October 1st 2013 8:44 am -04:00,I guess the rational thing to do is to just try to do as well as I can on the exam.Whats unfair is that I havent yet finished the material for week 6 and didnt even start week 7. Also it took me 10 minutes to realize what was going on and I am not in the best frame of mind (mad as hell at myself and all).So I am not very optimistic as to what grade I will get.I sincerely hope there is a solution to this situation and I am very aware that I am 100% to blame.Now back to the exam., Resolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 11:31 am -04:00,Thanks for your comforting words Hristina.I just finished the exam frantically using my incomplete knowledge of Python so far and attempting to answer as best I could. Fingers crossed: well see what happens.If I could humbly give a suggestion (and again fully conscious it was all my fault):out of an abundance of caution a big red sign saying DO NOT PRESS UNLESS YOU ARE READY TO TAKE THE EXAM  next to the blue Attempt Exam button would be helpful. , Resolved,11
