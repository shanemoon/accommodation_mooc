Monday August 19th 2013 12:56 pm -04:00,Hello! I am Erin from the Seattle Washington USA. Currently I am applying for a Masters in Library and Information Science. I thought having a fundamental understanding would be great to go with this degree (as you can choose this route with the Masters but why when I can learn it at my own pace?!) Also my fiance runs python and has a raspberry pi thing. I saw him tinkering and thought it would be an interesting to learn.,None,0
