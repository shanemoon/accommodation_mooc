Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:50 am -04:00,Starting from today with Homework - Exercise 3 radio buttons and check boxes become invisible for me. Hot links are there but radio buttons and check boxes are invisible including the confirmation check boxes on this page. Browser was Chrome 26.0 I have upgraded to Chrome 29.0 after this incident but radio buttons and check boxes are still invisible. Mouse pointer shows the hot link but actual button and box is invisible. I have completed the Exercise 3 by guesswork.Is it only me who is having this problem? Any solution you may suggest? Thank you in advance.O.K. While I was writing this message check boxes on message editing page suddenly appeared! Most strange happening so far. So I still keep this message on the forum just in case it happens to someone else. Keep waiting check boxes reappear if you persist! Cheers., Resolved,0

I figure there is a delay of loading check boxes and radio buttons at Chrome browser because they are shown at Firefox with no problem. Why this has started today I do not know but the interim solution is to wait until they show up. Cheers., Resolved,0
