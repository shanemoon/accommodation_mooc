Monday August 19th 2013 4:40 pm -04:00,On questions where it asks you:What value does x refer to? Im a bit confused. At first I thought that x refers to a memory address but then I decided against stating that in my answer.I tried to submit the answer:x refers to the float 2.0 But I got it wrong.I read the Question explanation section and I thought that the question was actually asking whether x was a float or int. I tried just int or float but got those wrong. I finally tried to actually do them in the shell and copied the answers over and got those right.Im not really sure if its just me having a stupid moment but I found those questions/the explanation a little bit misguiding/confusing. Any thoughts?,None,0
