Monday August 19th 2013 3:39 am -04:00,Hello my name is Todd and I live in Payson AZ. USA. I am enjoying retired life by taking classes online and at my local community college. I have an avid interest in computers especially networking various OS platforms together - like Windows and Linux. I enjoy math and programming so I want to put those two together using Python which is a new language to me.I am very happy to meet all of my fellow students!~todd,None,8
