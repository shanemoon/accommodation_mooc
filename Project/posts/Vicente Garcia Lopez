Tuesday August 27th 2013 5:32 am -04:00,Hi I cant fully understand why the result in the last exercise on input/output and string formatting is this:Consider this function call:print(\ is the newline character in Python)What is printed by this function call? is the newline character in Python???? shouldnt be ...?\is the newline character in Python, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 3:58 pm -04:00,thanks you were right. I was obsesed with the newline and didnt check twice about the backslash. :), Resolved,2
Friday September 13th 2013 3:52 pm -04:00,I still dont know how to do this one.... I know Im close...but theres something I dont know HOW to do properly... it checks the dna but the number is always the number length of the dna (not only the occurrences with the nucleotide).I feel frustration. :S, Unresolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 4:12 pm -04:00,I was doing this:>>>occurrences = 0      for nucleotide in dna:          if nucleotide in dna:              occurrences += 1      return occurrences..and I fail miserably... Ill try the str method (but I thought you couldnt use them) ¿?.. thanks, Unresolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 4:28 pm -04:00,Ok I think Ive done it.... a bit of a messy code anyway... but it works!, Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 5:55 am -04:00,theres lots of ideas around the net... but with only 4 weeks and the basics... do we have enough knowledge to make something worthwhile? no disrespect here...just curious.,None,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 9:24 am -04:00,I have finished to code insert_sequence in the assignment 2.. in what I think is the most ugly piece of code Ive written ever.Does it works? I think so... but I feel ashamed and uneasy to even look at it.Can I post it here? maybe someone with experience in programming can lead me to the nice way of doing programs...hehe, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 9:38 am -04:00,well the third one with the index 5 I coded to give me no value at all (so its expected). Only the values that can be worked in dna (including the negative numbers too).The other examples works fine., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 9:55 am -04:00,Ok I added the line needed... now works with all of the examples ... but its even uglier and large code... :D, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 10:09 am -04:00,19 lines of code with the definition. brute code., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 10:44 am -04:00,yeah... all executable lines.. I sent the assignment and it says its ok.... but I dont like it at all... should be better written., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 1:45 am -04:00,Well I set 3 possibilities stages for index: when is greater than 0 equal to 0 and less than 0. then I write within the scope of greater than 0 if index is <= lenght of dna and else (for if not). Then on equal to 0 just the sum of dna2 and dna1.Last within the less than 0 I write the possibilities for when index is a negative number (a little set of steps a bit difficult to explain if its not showing --- I promise once the hardline is over I will show-).Thats basically was my approach. the thing is it works on all cases.... negatives 0 extremes....all of them., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 2:43 am -04:00,if index > 0:        if index <= len(dna1):            dna1_1 = dna1 [: (index)]            dna1_2 = dna1 [(index) :]            return dna1_1 + dna2 + dna1_2        else:            return dna1 + dna2I used indexing and slicing too within the scopes. for example the example above:its just a piece of the code. As you can see its a bit of a brute way of thinking there... too strict and no flexibility or style... , Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 1:47 am -04:00,Id love to know how to do it in 2 lines code including the def as some anonymous stated before. :D, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 5:05 am -04:00,Martin  that doesnt return an error in my code its just simply ignore it if the index is > dna and then return the dna1 + dna2.But although I could change that bit of code it doesnt necessarily makes the code wrong. I sent it and passed the coursera assignment test., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 7:03 am -04:00,Try this:>>>insert_sequence (CCGGAT -2)should be CCGATG  but that wont happen in the line you wrote. Unless its not like that and then you are correct., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 8:42 am -04:00,its an ambiguous way..... I took as if I was watching the index from end to beginning... that was my approach... yours could be fine too. if index is -2 it means that character -2 (in this case is 2 the other way around but could be a different number)is the one you have to check and then put the dna from there on like if index would be 2., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 1:17 pm -04:00,I rewrote it again to 3 lines this time. could be in 1 but I wanted to do the negative index too my way. Anyway I will keep the ugly version for a laugh in the future.Thanks guys., Unresolved,0
