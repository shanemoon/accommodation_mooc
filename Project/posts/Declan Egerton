Thursday September 5th 2013 10:55 am -04:00,I moved house and had to complete the first week assignment at a friends house. I was then on holiday for a week.My internet was set up today and I am two weeks behind I have only a few days to complete week 2 and also to catch up on week 3 to ensure i am completely up to date!Lets get this done!,None,-1
Friday September 6th 2013 7:42 am -04:00,I am stumped... seriously struggling with assignment 1 right at the start!Step 2 return statement I just cant get my head around what I am supposed to type Ive watched and re-watched all the lectures and I still dont understand.I know that I am supposed to type return but that is as far as I get... I just feel like I am hitting my head against a wall because I know the answer is so simple but I just cant get a hold of it.I cant get to grips with any of the words being used either I remember them for a few minutes and then I have to check as to what they mean again am I just being incredibly stupid or is anyone else having the issues that I am having?, Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 7:58 am -04:00,Yes i have and i ended with 17/18 (getting question 14 wrong every time)I dont understand what command i am supposed to call upon to figure out the difference between the two.I know i need to call the return statement and also time_1 and time_2 however the command to figure out the time difference is a blur., Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 8:02 am -04:00,That was what i thought originally however when i use the mathematical equation i receive the answer 1800.0 when i should be receiving the answer -1800.0 according to the handout. This is what is confusing me.5. Copy and paste this call on the function you just completed: seconds_difference(3600.0 1800.0) . With luck youll see -1800.0. >>> ================================ RESTART ================================>>> >>> seconds_difference(3600.0 1800.0)1800.0>>> , Resolved,0
