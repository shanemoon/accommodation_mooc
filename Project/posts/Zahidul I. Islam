Tuesday August 27th 2013 7:06 pm -04:00,When I finished my assignment and submitted my work I got something incorrect and it advised me to do this:Test the values where time in time zone UTC+0 is just before midnight        but time in time zone utc_offset is just after midnight.        (This means that UTC+0 is earlier than time zone utc_offset.)Message:FAILURE: AssertionError23.0 != 1.0 within 7 places Now I quite dont understand what it means I re-checked my time_to_utc function where this error occurred but it seems all correct to me as all of the examples given output correctly. Can someone guide me how to check and see what Ive done wrong?TL;DR How exactly would I debug my code to find the specific error?, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 9:43 pm -04:00,Well anyways I found the faulty code... apparently I thought it was a good idea to wrap my whole return statement in a absolute value function.... dont know how that happened.. well nevertheless issue is resolved. Thanks for everyone who tried to help :3, Resolved,1

Wednesday August 28th 2013 9:05 am -04:00,Well in my opinion the instructions should be a balance of both not too difficult and complex so beginners cant understand what they are supposed to do nor too easy because just giving straightforward instruction ruins the learning experience and doesnt make you think or work for your perfect answer. , Unresolved,1
