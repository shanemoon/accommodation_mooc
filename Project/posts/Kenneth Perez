Friday September 6th 2013 2:29 am -04:00,Thanks for the help everyone. Sometimes people are tired and vent in the wrong place. I am working on this class at 11:26 p.m. pacific standard time after having worked eight hours and then had to work with my children. I get them to sleep and have little time to really immerse in learning how to code. Hints and forums help. Once again thanks., Unresolved Locked,0
