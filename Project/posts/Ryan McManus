Saturday September 28th 2013 7:33 pm -04:00,Not sure if Im running into the same issue but when I hand mine in(While getting no errors running the program) I lose 4 marks from errors on the first 4 tests(Regarding read_board). Ive been rewriting the code for about 4 hours now and anything I try either doesnt work or provides the same errors despite everything working fine.Message:ERROR: IndexErrorstring index out of range, Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 8:58 pm -04:00,@Denis All the loops I used were while and if loops searching for  and . The issue I had was the program was looking for an  at the end of the board file which didnt exist causing the string error. I (finally) fixed it and 37/37d it by forcing an  at the end of the last string.Thank you., Resolved,0
