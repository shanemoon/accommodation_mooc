Tuesday August 20th 2013 12:00 am -04:00,It depends on what version of Windows you are using.You can see this in:Control Panel -> System System Type: 32-bit Operating System or 64-bit Operating SystemIf you are using the version of Windows 64-bit I advise using the 64-bit IDLE too just like me.Link:http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads/thank-you?dl=http://downloads.activestate.com/Acti...Hope this helps!, Resolved,0
