Monday August 19th 2013 11:20 am -04:00,Last March I worked through the Fundamentals class on my own through the final exam to prepare for Crafting Quality Code. I did not earn the statement of accomplishment for the Fundamentals course but did earn the statement of accomplishment for Crafting Quality Code. Will I be able to fill in the exercises quizzes and exams using my notes or is this class material different from the previous offering? Or is the Crafting Quality Code certificate alone sufficient to demonstrate my knowledge?,None,0
