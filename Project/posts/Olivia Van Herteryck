Wednesday October 2nd 2013 1:18 pm -04:00,My make_str_from_row function works in IDLE but comes with an error when I submit it. There is no explanation.for char in board[row_index]:        print(char end=)I realize I have no clue where to start. The text file comes in rows of characters. Am I supposed to convert this to a list of list of strings first? Is board the argument for the function? Or am I supposed to define my own variables? What is the sequence of steps I need to take to make this function work?I had full marks on assignments before and now I cant even get started! Please help! :(, Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 4:44 pm -04:00,The code above does work in IDLE it prints ANTT on the example. What is wrong with the code below? for char in board[row_index]:        print (char end=)Or do I need to accumulate those characters into a string? Append?The thing is i am really confused where to start.  I dont understand what is my parameter/argument - is the board already converted to a list of lists of strings by the starter code or do I need to do it? What do they mean by index in a3.py:         for char in index[row_index]:                print and what is the output I should be getting from this function - is it a string with a length of len(board)? Is len(board) the lengths of the row or the total number of characters in the board? My result should be the argument for the next function but I dont understand which variable it is.  Is board the result of this function or the argument? Oh please help me out of my misery ;( , Unresolved,0
