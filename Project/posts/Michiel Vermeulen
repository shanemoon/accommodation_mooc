Monday August 19th 2013 1:49 pm -04:00,Hi!Suppose:x=2y=3z=x+yThen  z and enter result in 5 (correctly)I then type:x=6y=7and then:zEnter gives 5 again.  Why not 13 ?Why do we have to redefine z= x+y ?Thanks!, Resolved,8
Monday August 19th 2013 2:29 pm -04:00,Thanks Etienne Samuel and Gerry! I understand.Nevertheless I find it a bit cumbersome to redefine z each time as z = x+y when we only change the value of x and y ...., Resolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 4:05 pm -04:00,I agree. I have now also learned to build my own functions. My issue is then resolved. I now only need to define the function once., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 8:04 am -04:00,I believe that the word parameters is used only for functions that one defines oneself while the word argument  is used only for built-in functions such as for example min or max.So I believe that def function_name(argument) is not correct while def function_name(parameters) is correct., Resolved,2
Tuesday August 20th 2013 8:13 am -04:00,Anonymous I am not so sure.....Take the built-in function max(ab).Are a and b parameters or arguments? I believe a and b are arguments., Resolved,1
Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:16 am -04:00,Thanks Anonymous and Tom: that are the correct answers., Resolved,1
Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:41 am -04:00,HiWhy does Python accepts an expression as 8.9 // 6.7 ( integer division) while 8.9 and 6.7 are not integers?One would expect a syntax error., Resolved,1
Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:55 am -04:00,Thanks David and Amarildo. I was just wondering.  By the way Amarildo : 8.9 // 6.7 returns 1.0 not 1, Resolved,2
Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:58 am -04:00,HiWhere can one find mathematical built-in functions in Python such as log(x) sin(x) sqrt(x) etcetera?Thanks., Resolved,0

Wednesday August 21st 2013 2:40 pm -04:00,In the second lecture of week 1 a long list of programming languages is shown.Are all programming languages equivalent in the sense that each given program can be written in any language? (since any language ultimately translates into machine language).I.e. the only difference between programming languages is in their ease of use?,None,5
Wednesday August 21st 2013 7:26 pm -04:00,Gerry thanks for your reaction.My question is however more theoretical than practical as Etienne understood it (I think). My question is: Given a program M written in a computerlanguage P. Given another computerlanguage Q. Is it possible to write a program T in Q such that when I read in program M (optically for example) in program T out comes a program N written in Q that does exactly the same thing as the original program M.And vice versa. This is what I meant with my question: are all programming languages equivalent? Since any program boils down to 0s and 1s read by a machine I suspect the answer to my question is yes. You just need a clever program T.,None,0
Friday August 23rd 2013 12:37 am -04:00,Hi KeithYes I quess you could rephrase my question as you do: can any program (=set of instructions) in theory be written in any programming lanquage? See answer of Joshua McGee below.  For me the question is answered.,None,0
Thursday August 22nd 2013 6:13 am -04:00,Thanks Larry and Peter for your elaborate answers. I agree that in practice programming languages are not equivalent but I think that in theory any programming language can be translated into another programming language by descending to the machine code from the first programming language and then reconstruct the second programming language from the machine code up (or is the second step also in theory impossible?).Any programming language can - I believe-  be simulated by a mecanical/ manual procedure and thus all programming languages are equivalent with this mecanical/manual procedure.Also see the link that Etienne provides in his first reaction.,None,0
Friday August 23rd 2013 1:37 am -04:00,Anonymous and EtienneI have the same problem: if I save a simple exercise in a Python file and open the file again the saved program does not calculate anymore..... Strange..., Resolved,0
Friday August 23rd 2013 6:46 am -04:00,Hi EtienneIt is just a simple exercise that I saved to try out the save file option:x=3y=4z=x+yzWhen I re-open the file it does not calculate anymore same as Anonymous. Also not when I do Run Module., Resolved,0
Friday August 23rd 2013 7:19 am -04:00,I get: invalid syntax. Do I need to open a new window befor I can run the saved exercise? Should I do F5 on the saved file or on the new window?Is it not possibel to run the exercise in the saved file? Why do you open a new window?Thanks Michiel, Resolved,0
Friday August 23rd 2013 7:47 am -04:00,Thanks still not working but Ill figure it out. No time right now.One would expect to simply open de saved file with the exercise and continue in there as if the file had never been saved (and re-opened)., Resolved,1
Friday August 23rd 2013 3:27 pm -04:00,Etienne Ive got it. There are Python screens with prompts >>> and when you open a new window you get a window without prompts.The programs (i.e. my exercise) need to be saved in the screen without the prompts. Then Run module (F5)., Resolved,1
Friday August 23rd 2013 4:37 pm -04:00,I learned that the window with the >>> is the Python interactive screen  not where you write programs. That you better do in the screen without the >>>This is actually what Jennifer Campbell does in her last lecture of week 1 by copying the functions she defines in the Python interpreter with the >>> to a new window/file. You just have to be careful you dont copy the >>> to the new window., Resolved,2
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:44 am -04:00,Etienne and when will this basic Python course be offered again? Unfortunateley I have to drop out because of time constraints. Excellent course with great help from TAs and other students. Thank you!I realize however that one has to practice quite a bit and that is time consuming.See you!, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 1:10 am -04:00,Thanks I will add it to my watchlist., Resolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 8:54 am -04:00,I have a question relating to the last slide of this quiz: part of the correct answer is It doest say what the function returns.But it does doesnt it? The description  mentions that the function counts voyels.Could somebody please explain why this is not sufficient?, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:30 pm -04:00,HiWhy does hello returns hello  and not hello  ?Thanks!, Resolved,1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:44 pm -04:00,Not always: youre  returns youre with double quotes., Resolved,2
Friday August 30th 2013 7:36 am -04:00,So None is a type and None is a  string.x= Noneprint (x)gives the result None as a (text) variable.Correct?, Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 1:21 am -04:00,Jen in Question 6 it prints Canada without the quotes doesnt it?But why does - with the correct function body- instructor_location returns Canada and not Canada ? Here I would have expected quotes., Unresolved,2

Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:10 pm -04:00,HiHow does one distinguish a variable from a string?Are all variables strings but not vice-versa?Thanks!, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:26 pm -04:00,Anonymous and RicardoThanks I understand the difference between a variable and a string but how do you recognize the difference just by looking at it?Suppose I write : city . Can you tell wheter this is a variable or a string?, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:39 pm -04:00,Thanks Ricardo that is cristal clear.Another question: a string is defined as  any sequene of characters between quotes.Is city a string?  And   ?Type it in Python a see what is returns....., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:52 pm -04:00,Hi RicardoLet it be.... Not that important but I was just wondering wheter the definition of a string being any sequence of characters between quotes is correct...., Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 6:35 am -04:00,Merci EtienneSo what we also learn now is that you dont need the + sign to concatenate strings:hello city  returns the same as hello+city namely hellocity, Resolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 7:58 am -04:00,Yep good to notice: for variables you do need the + sign tot concatenate.Topic closed as far as I am concerned. Thanks to you and Ricardo.  Havent watched the other videos yet. Little time this week...., Resolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 7:04 am -04:00,HiHow can one edit in the Python interpreter? It seems that one has to start all over if one wants to correct a mistake. It seems not possible to put the cursor simply at the place where one wants to make a change., Unresolved,1
Friday August 30th 2013 7:25 am -04:00,HiWhy does- with the correct function body- instructor_location returns Canada and not Canada ?I do understand why print (instructor_location) returns Canada (i.e. without quotes).Thanks., Unresolved,3
Saturday August 31st 2013 10:36 am -04:00,Anonymous thanks but why does it return Canada and not Canada (with quotes) ?, Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 11:31 am -04:00,Janine thanks. I know that a print statement always returns without quotes.But why does < Return country> returns Canada without quotes? The variable to be returned is Canada isnt it?, Unresolved,1
Saturday August 31st 2013 12:28 pm -04:00,Michael thanks. But in Exercise 6 it seems to me that Canada is returned (not printed) without quotes. In your example Hello  is returned (not printed) with quotes.Why is Canada in exercise 6  returned (=not printed) without quotes?, Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 2:18 pm -04:00,Michael also in your example the return values (not printed) are between quotes (the value is five). In exercise 6 however canada is returned (not printed) without quotes. Any idea why?, Unresolved,0
