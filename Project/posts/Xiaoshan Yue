Thursday September 12th 2013 5:32 pm -04:00,I am not sure but could you try to move the print... or return... out of your loop? I imagine maybe you print the char you got every time the loop executes and thats why you get them print vertically. But the confusing thing is that if this is the case I suppose you will get the LAST complementary character in the string but not the FIRST when you use return...Anyway I think a better way is to save your result to a string every time you execute the loop. Then you can return the overall string in the end., Unresolved,0
