Please take a look at the snap shot of the problems.:1)My python shell complained of type error. so it did not even run to give me an answer.2) when I used the visualizer it ran. however my output was integer 80 instead of float  80.5. here is the link:http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=def+cal_avg(asign_grad)%3A%0A+%0A+++%23%22%22%22+%0A+++%2...what must be the problem?? please help ......what must be the problem?? please help ......, Resolved,0
