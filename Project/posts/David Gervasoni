Monday August 19th 2013 12:19 pm -04:00,Janine Polster is totally right.You have to say to the function wich values ARE base and height.You can call your function with    area(52)or with    a = 5    b=2    area(ab)or again with   base=5   height=2   area(baseheight)but you have to specify wich parameters you want to pass to your function., Resolved,3

Monday August 19th 2013 5:13 pm -04:00,Chinmaywriting code in a console is mainly like writing code in the windows notepad.You see just some text without colour without any kind of help. And then youve tosave your text (your program) and run it from a command line.If you use IDLE you see coloured text that helps you recognizing what youre writing(a function a number a variable etc) you have auto-completion and oftenthe IDLE says you if youre doing some errors before the compilation and the run.It is very very easier to write a program in an IDE instead that in a command line!, Resolved,3

Sunday August 25th 2013 11:12 am -04:00,Ill try to explain. Let me know if you get it.When the quiz asks you if an instruction is correct it supposes that you run that string and only that string as a complete instruction. In this specific case you can try it by creating a module with the line    4**and run it.If you write on a command line 4** and you press enter the interpreter thinks that the instruction is not completed. So it waits for another input. I tihink (but Im not sure and I cannot try it now) you can say the console it is a completed instruction by inserting a semicolon at the end like:    4**;But I repeat Im not sure!Is now clear? ;), Resolved,0

Tuesday August 20th 2013 10:01 am -04:00,Anon your answer is correct!!The operator // just results in a value without decimal (or with zero as decimal) it doesnt accept only integer.It perform a Floor Division where the result is the quotient in which the digitsafter the decimal point are removed.// is the floor division operator. //always performs floor division no matter what the types ofits operands are so 1 // 2 is 0 and 1.0 // 2.0 is also0.0.,None,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 10:17 am -04:00,Well in a certain way youre right (Ill ask the teachers and Ill let you know)Now I just can tell you that the operator // doesnt return you always a specified type.
