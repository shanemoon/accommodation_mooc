Friday September 13th 2013 2:05 pm -04:00,I submitted my assignment twice but I am still having a little problem with the get_complementary_sequence because my code did not pass all the tests. Since I have a background in biology when I read the description of the get_complementary_sequence function I immediately thought of this as finding the reverse complement of a sequence. And it seemed to be true because the auto-grader used the sequence GCTAGCTA and expected it to return TAGCTAGC. Like the name implies first you take the complement of GCTAGCTA (which is CGATCGAT) then reverse it to get TAGCTAGC.So I was kind of confused when I saw that the example given in the handout stated that if we call this function with AT as the argument it returns TA. However using the same rule for the longer sequence should not the function return AT instead of TA? Otherwise it is just returning the complement of AT., Resolved,0
