Monday August 19th 2013 7:55 am -04:00,Hello everyone!I wonder if anyone came across the same problem?If I open html5 player then the UI of the player appears ont he screen but nothing happens — it looks like the video is loading but waiting does not help the issue. I can easily switch to Flash players but its not an option for quizzes — Flash player does not support them. I am Mac OS user (Mac OS 10.6.8) and I use Chrome (Version 28.0.1500.95)Switching back and forth is not that difficult but itd be nice to have players work properly. Has anyone faced the same problem and if yes — what did you do?ThanksDaria, Resolved,2

Added the domain to the manageable exceptions and html5 player works just fine. (Havent checked the Flash player but Im sure that one will be okay too.)Thank you very much!, Resolved,0
