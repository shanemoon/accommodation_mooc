This is what I tried.>>> def average (a b c d):       return ( max (a b c d) + I don´t know how to continue ) / 2I´m using a b c d e because I don´t know a priori which number is the highest so the computer has to do it for me I saw you can write if and not but how to use this commands? xD This was the reason why I said I should start with something easier.Do you mean the 2 highest numbers as your partial formula would suggest?if so that is easy to dofirst create a list of the valuesvalues = [89421876287365564822310777]then we sort the list python makes that easyvalues.sort()now all we need is the last to items in the listhighest_2 = values[-2:]add them together with another handy built in function and divide by 2average = sum(highest_2) / 2and to put it all in a handy functionvalues = [89421876287365564822310777]def average(values):    values.sort()    return sum(values[-2:])/2call it like this print(average(values)),None,9

Wednesday September 11th 2013 6:07 pm -04:00,Your the one to talk about the greater good and Derogatory Comments  Any one that has made a statement in contradiction to your own opinion has only received sarcastic responses telling them why they are wrong and you are right.Your response to Barry is a good example.  To start with most of us DID read your original post and Barry is right all you are doing is whining you are not doing anything to Further The Greater Good  read your points most are just selfishdemands that make the false assumption that you speak for the majority and that you (not someone teaching the course) knows better then the course instructors and staff what it takes to teach a course to 65000+ people at the same time.Lets walk through a few of your reasons list in your original postPoint 1If someone makes a mistake then they should not have to wait.Why it is their mistake  your or someone else has no more rights to use the resources than anyone else.  So why should the person that makes a mistake be granted more access then anyone else. Point 2On a Whim the instructors imposed this limit. Really.  So the instructors pulled a number out of thin air and made it a rule.ar·bi·trar·y    based on random choice or personal whim rather than any reason or system.In case you didnt know the definition. Point 3A lack of feedback is frustrating.You have access to the forum the python visualizer the idle debugger and the internet yet the auto-grader is your only option.Point 4From an educational standpoint the instructors and their resources should be at my full dispose. When in your real life did you goto class get an assignment do a small part of it hand it in to the instructor get it right back corrected for only what you did and get to do it all over again until you are finished.  This is totally unrealistic thinking.Point 5   Quote  A sizable proportion of the students will want (or feel that they need) the validation of the grader at each step along the way.  Youre not letting them do that in a practical manner.  It shouldnt matter to you what the anxiety level of each student is. end quoteYes lets say that something is important in one sentence and then in the very next contradict your own argumentbut non the less  you can not give everyone what they want or fell they want  logistics prevents this.  But as said before they have access to the forum the python visualizer the idle debugger and the internet.  Point 6 No need to go over this one  since we all know that like most of your other points you posted with out any knowledge of the subject.point 7many / most / all of the students are busy people with other things going on besides waiting an hour to resubmit.So you think that you have to sit there in front of the computer with that page open and wait.No someone should have told you that you can do other things like work on you code  visit the forum and get some help with your errors  watch something on tv  get up and go outside  all the other things you need to do in life.point 8 Quote Eighth fixing problems is often an iterative process.  Introducing a long delay is not only not teaching good debugging skills (yes I know that you want students to test in IDLE but Im talking about the problems introduced in the grade submission process) because it doesnt mirror reality but students will lose focus and thereby the thread of what it is they were trying to fix. Thats not educationally-friendly.  For most but the very dedicated they will also lose the joy of the early wins of Hello World programming and instead associate programming with excruciating delays and just give up on programming altogether.  The opposite of your intent I would assume.  end quoteThis Would suggest that you have a doctorate in psychology and another in teaching programming skills.  This point is just arrogantPoint 9Quote save all of us the grief of someone (or thousands of someones) trying to submit close to the deadline and being told that they have to wait an hour to resubmit something when there is less than an hour before deadline.  The fora(e?) will become overloaded with pleas of forbearance because its not my fault - and other than leaving things to the last hour (which is their right) theyd be right.  The fault for them not being able to submit would be yours. end quoteThis is the only point you have made that carries any weight.  Although you make the argument poorly because you talk about someones right to wait till the last minute.  If they know about the submission time limit then they should take that into account when they submit.  Procrastinating until the last minute may be their choice but that also makes it their choice to possibly fail that assignment making it their own fault if they do so.  So a poorly argument and a sad attempt to place blame on someone other then someone acting irresponsible with their time.I would have appealed to the fact the approaching the deadline a portion of the students that are struggling with the assignment might run in to trouble and that removing the limit shortly ahead of the deadline (maybe a few hours maybe a day) would be a benefit to those students.  Point 10 is a joke so I will leave it at that.But if you are serious about The Greater Good then maybe you should start contributing in some other part of the forum.  Share some knowledge with your fellow students that are making posts asking for help understanding the problems. Do something real., Resolved,1

Friday September 13th 2013 4:47 pm -04:00,Again there is no best or better way of doing it.  The way that takes all of the data in to account  processes all the data as needed and returns the correct answer in a timely manner is the best way and it can be achieved in many different ways so there is no one best or better way.  Assignment 2 is a good exampleIn the last 4 functions you are asked to write you are told not to use str methods.  Well in python the Best Practices would be to use str methods if possiable as they are build for this type of use.If we were allowed to use str methods then all the functions could be done with one-line function bodies like the first assignment.  But then we would not have had any practice with for loops if/elif/else blocks  char in string or any of the other thing they want to teach us with this lesson.  Which is the goal of the assignment not to teach you the Best Practices but to teach you a first way.  Before you can adopt a best practice you need to know the different ways of doing things and after you learn to do different thing you will learn what will work and what will not.  And you will learn that the best practice is to write code that works as it should.  If you want a Best Practices then look at the guide that is part of the python documentation http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ it is a guide not an end all be all of python but fits you Best Practices definition better then any thing else I have seen.  , Unresolved,0

Saturday September 14th 2013 3:53 pm -04:00,It sounds like you got the idea  we could also go a step further and not even create a second tape to count again.you created the whole tape to process in your c variable example 2+2 creates the sequence11011then what the for loop does is creates a second tape1111and that goes to your helper functionprison_to_numwhich really only counts the length of the tape and not what is on the tapeif you pass c to your prison_to_num function and changes it to read the tape and do the calculationsthere I think that would be more in the spirit of a Truing machine.in prison_to_num you could use the for loop to count instead of build a new tape.and it would give you a head start on expanding your program to accept more then just 2 numbersalso you could will a little more input make it also subtract multiply and divide.A Turing machine has an alphabet  if you expand your alphabet from just 1 and 0 there is a lot you could simulate just by adding a few characters.A Turning machine seems like a lot of fun. and I think it is a great project to work on.  As your skills increase so will the simulation.  I would stick with it.     ,None,1

Wednesday September 18th 2013 1:40 pm -04:00,The majority of arrogates and condescension in this thread is from you.  As we were having a pleasant discussion on this topic sharing different points of view. They you come in with out reading more then a few comments and decide we are all a bunch of idiots and we should bow to your infinite knowledge of English and Python statistics mathematics and mountaineering.  So if you wish to start throwing insults and continue to talk down to every one that shares a different opinion then you then we can continue on that path.If you wish to start throwing insults and continue to talk down to every one that shares a differing opinion to yours then we can continue on that path.First why dont you read some (or maybe all) of the posts before you jump in with your foot in your mouth it is oblivious you did not read more then one or two post and then decided to jump in and show your lack of understanding of the discussion  Second if you are going to join in offer a smart counter proposal  try not to bring up subject as examples that you also do not know anything about.  For the record a range in mathematics does have meaning and in statistics the range would not refer to 9  I am not an expert on statistics  but if I remember correctly it has to do with the size of the smallest data set and in this case it can not be 9 since the only data set is size 10 and yes in geology and mountaineering a mountain range is different then in python but we are not talking about any of those subjects now are we.  Third all the words between Absolutely and issue do not constitute a Typo thiis is a tiepoFourth there is no alternative interpretation of the English phrase 1 through 10  it is 1 through 10 not 0 through 9 it is a misstatement or they intended to use other code  either way the word do not match the code but I said that 2 days ago look at the post below this one.  That was even before you came in here and opened your mouth and started talking gibberish about 0 is 1 2 is 1 and 2Fifth Do not tell another student to go else where you are no one in a position to tell someone else to go anywhere.Because someone is smarter then you does not mean they are trying to make anyone fell bad you little man.  Your petty insecurities have no place here as no one here will coddle you and tell you lies about you being the smartest one in the room.  Every time you open your mouth you prove you still have a lot to learn.  So maybe you should try to learn from the conversation instead of thinking you know everything instead of only proving otherwise.Now you can say that people are being arrogant and condescending.  I will point out that it may also be rude and insulting at points.   So if you do not like being talked to this way do not talk to me or any one else here in this manner.  So you can join in a pleasant discussion or you can continue to be rude and insulting it which case so will others. , Resolved,2

Sunday September 29th 2013 4:37 pm -04:00,James is right about your test cases that is causing the error in the shellbut to add to what he saysthe failure the grader is giving you is a little different then your test casesif you look at the board examples James has given us  the square board has the same number of rows as columnslet us look now at the tall rectangle it had 6 rows and 4 columnsyour codedef board_contains_word_in_column(board word):        for column_index in range(len(board)):                if word in make_str_from_column(boardcolumn_index):                        return True        return Falsein your code you are using the length of the board to loop over each columnlets look at what happens lets trace this by handenter function argument that you have board and wordstart for loop column_index is set to a range of 0 through the length of the board with the tall rectangle example that is 5 so it is 0 - 5 six rows 012345next we check if the word is in column 0 of the board (getting a string from make_str_from_column(boardcolumn_index)) when we do this we pass the 6 by 4 board and a 0 for the index to that functionand get back that column as a string.we will skip the returns and for now just assume that the answer to the test is false that way we can go back to the start of the loop and do the next iteration so back to the loop now column_index is 1and we repeat the if testnext time around column_index is 2then 3then 4now all of a sudden the program stops and you see all the error messagesat four we get an index error because there are only 4 columns column 0123lets look at the for loop again        for column_index in range(len(board)):we are using the number of rows to count over the columns  so if there are more rows then columns then we get an index error because of it.and if there were more columns then rows like Jamess wide rectangle example then you would not read all the columns and you would not get an error but you would get a failure from the grader because you did not read all the columns and you might return False if the word is in one of the columns you did not readnow lets look at Jamess example boards again and see if we can find the information to fix thisthe square board is 4 rows by 4 columnswide is3 rows by 4 columnstall is 6 rows by 4 columnsokay I see a pattern  the length of a row is equal to the number of columnsif a row has 4 letters in it then that means that it will have 4 columnsif a row has 9 letters in it then that means that it will have 9 columnsevery board also has exactly 1 thing in common they all have a first roweven a 1 row by 200 column board has a first rowso that means that we now know that the length of the first row is equal to the number of columns on the boardlets go back to the for loopfor column_index in range(len(board)):so to make column_index count the columns and not the rows we will need to make a small change in the range statementright now we get the length of the board which is equal to the number of rows len(board)all we need to do is change what we get the length of instead of the len(board) we need to get the length of row 0and to do that we use indexing so board[0] because the first row is index 0 and then we use that in our len() that goes in our range() range(len(board[0]))so make the change and then like I showed you above trace this by hand and see what happens after that run it in idle or the visualizer to make sure you are getting the right answers  , Resolved,8

Saturday September 28th 2013 2:57 am -04:00,I think you are getting that error because you are passing the function a string probably the name of a file.  and not an open file for readingcall the function like this for testingread_words(open(wordlist1.txt r))or outside the function  open the file and pass that to the functionfile = open(wordlist1.txt r)read_words(file), Unresolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 4:06 am -04:00,almost there is only one little problem str(list)str makes it a string it is already a stringyou need to append a list to your listdont worry there is a simple fix and you will be donestr() will make something a stringwell lists have a method to do the same thinglist()so just like str() will turn something into a stringlist() will turn a string into a listso to fix your code all you need to do is change the letters str in this line to list        board.append(str(list))that is it and make sure board =  is at the same indent level as that rest of the codeso indent and change ONLY str to listthen I would like it if you looked up list() in the python docs so that you really understand why we did this :), Resolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 4:33 pm -04:00,lets look at the docstring for a place to start     (file open for reading) -> list of list of str    Return a board read from open file board_file. The board file will contain    one row of the board per line. Newlines are not included in the board.    the contract is almost the same as for read_wordsa file that is already open is passed into the functionthe output is a list that will contain other lists in the other list will be stringsthe rest might read like you will return a list that will contain other lists in the other list will be stringsthe inner lists will represent the different rows of the board one row is equal toone of the inner lists  each of the inner list will contains string each string willbe only one character [a b c d] when you read the file each line has a newline character at the end so when you make the inner lists you will need to remove this newline characterso your board will look something like thisjust an example[[A N T T] [X S O B]]  , Resolved,0

Friday September 27th 2013 5:55 pm -04:00,Mr. Boyd    Please take the advice given by your fellow students      Yes to read from a file it must be opened first  but you are overlooking     the fact that the file is open  it was opened for you by the driver file and     it was assigned to a variable.  And that variable was passed to the function    for you to use.          In a3_driver.py the tkinter module is used to get the file name of the file to     open then it is assigned to a variable and that variable is passed to the     function.  In your function you are to use that variable as the open file    because it contains the open file.  So a line like file = open(myFile.txt r)    was done already it was just not done by you.  The variable board_file contains    that exact code.  Your self defined file variable has exactly the content as    the passed board_file variable.  All you have to do is use it., Unresolved,0

Friday September 27th 2013 2:39 am -04:00,join is another option and I dont think it was covered anywhere except on the forum.  you do not have to use it if you dont understand it.stick with the for loop and an accumulator that will do the same thing.I will walk you through using a loop to do thisfirst I want to remind you what the board looks like stored as a list of list of strings[ [A N T T] [X S O B] ]this board is 2 rows by 4 columnsANTTXSOBand if you look close at the list I posted above you will see that it contains other list 2 of them in this caseand each of those list is filled with stringseach of the lists is a row.  lets stop there on the description that is what we need to know each of the inner lists is a rownow lets start our functiondef make_str_from_row(board row_index):this is the header it has 2 parameters1. the board just like the example above the size of the board does not matter2. the row_index or row number assume the row will always be validthen the docstring contractblah blah blah nothing to see here for now now this is the part we need to think about the function bodyand lets do this with stepsstep 1 make a temp variable that will hold an empty string step 2 make a simple for loop to loop over a rowstep 3 add the variable from the for loop to our temp variablestep 4 return your temp variablenow lets go over each step in some detail.step 1 make a temp variable that will hold an empty string remember a string is stuff surrounded by quotesso  quotes with nothing in the middle is an empty string step 2 make a simple for loop to loop over a rowthis is the hardest part of what we are going to do but dont worryit is also one of the easiest thing to dolets review for loops from the week 4 lecture notes (copy and pasted) for loop over strThe general form of a for loop over a string is:for variable in str:    body                The variable refers to each character of the string in turn and executes the body of the loop for each character. For example:>>> s = yesterday>>> for char in s:...     print(char)... yesterday    that was a copy and past  it was for strings but for a list the same thing happens watchweek = [Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday]for day in week:    print(day)MondayTuesdayWednesdayThursdayFridaySaturdaySundayexact same thing but instead of a character in the string we got an item in the listthis works for any list lets make it for a list of listsweek = [[Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday][M T W T F S S]]a list of lists one with the days as words one with the days as just the first letter of the word but both are still only stringsso back to the exampleweek = [[Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday][M T W T F S S]]for day in week:    print(day)[Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday][M T W T F S S]that was printed the both rows but we wanted to print just one rowwe will need to use an index we have 2 rows and indexes start at 0 so lets pick the second one for this example which is index 1 for day in week[1]:    print(day)MTWTFSSokay that is a for loop over a list and a list of a list and finally a list in a listor in our case a list in a list could be a row in the board HINT.okay now we can go on to step 3step 3 add the variable from the for loop to our temp variableremember for day in week; the variable day was the one that changed in the for loophere we need to add that to our temp variablereview a = hello b =      #<- there is a space in therec = a+bprint(c) hello d = worldc = c + d # HINTprint(c)hello worldthat is all you have to do in step 3 add the variables togetherand last but not any less important is step 4step 4 return your temp variablethats it you know how to do that one., Unresolved,15

Friday September 27th 2013 11:38 pm -04:00,okay lets seewe are working with board_contains correct.some of you metaphors are a little confusing sometimeand with a general of your example I would need to know more butIt would probably have something to do with the order of your test and the fact what you are looking for something in something and the thing on the left is a list and the thing on the right is a string or even a boolean. and it should be the other way aroundlets look at the real functions as this is something that we know all the variables of  def board_contains_word(board word):so we know that we have a board that is a list of listsand we have a word that is a stringthe error looks like you have the list and the string in the wrong places.but this function is a lot easier then most people are making it out to belets walk through a simple explanation of how to do this function with only 1 line of codeand you will under stand why only one line of code is need if I explain it correctlyboard_contain_word takes 2 parameters board and wordby now we have also written 2 other helper functionboard_contains_word_in_row() and board_contains_word_in_column()and both of them take 2 parameters board and wordeach of the 2 function return True or Falsenow lets go back to week 3 lecture notes for type boolThe or Logic TableThe or operator evaluates to True if and only if at least one operand is True.As such if the first operand is True the second condition will not even be checked because it is already known that the expression will produce True.expr1     expr2         expr1 or expr2True      True                 TrueTrue      False                TrueFalse     True                 TrueFalse     False                Falsenow this is what is important the tableit says that if we have 2 expression and if one of them is True then it will return an answer of True because at least one of them is Trueif this one is True or if this one is True then we get Truealso the only time we will get False is when both of them are False.remember this is the or logic table and not the AND or NOT logic table dont worry about them until you need them  you will not be using them here.okay now that we have done some review on the logic of OR now lets look at our board_contains_word functionand the helper functions board_contains_word will need to return True or Falseboard_contains_word_in_row() and board_contains_word_in_column() already return True or Falseeach helper function can be though of as an expressionand we can put them in the logic tableword_in_row(board word)    word_in_column(board word)      word_in_row() or word_in_column(board word) True                                                        True                                                          TrueTrue                                                        False                                                         TrueFalse                                                      True                                                           TrueFalse                                                       False                                                         False  so the table above it the result of board_contains_word_in_row(board word) or board_contains_word_in_column(board word)and we know that the above expression will return True or False based on the logic tablenow the board_contains_word() function needs to return True or Falseand we have an expression that will return True or Falseall you need to do is write a return statement that uses the expression above, Resolved,2
Thursday September 26th 2013 9:16 pm -04:00,lets walk through your code to see if we can find the problem# you have a good header we know thatdef board_contains_word_in_column(board word):    # you assign a value to numcols to the length of the first row so numcols will give you the correct number of columns    # you set a boolean to False to hold your results    # you do a for loop so that you can loop over all the columns in the board        # you test if the word is equal to the column this would be the problem        # you want to test if the word is in the column            # if the test is positive you set your boolean to refelect the result    # you return your resultso the only problem you have is your if condition  for it to return True right now the word would be the same as the whole column  but you just need to know if the word is in the column fix that and you got a working function., Unresolved,0

Can you give me some more info or direct me to a source which describes distinction between shell and a new python window clearly.This is one of the things I dont like about this course  the use of idle  but I do see why they did it.look at the a3.py file is a collection of functions.  and then the a3_driver.py lets show an exampleyour on windowsopen a cmd windowcan cd to your python folder where your python folder cd \python33I dont know how your path is set up so I will make some assumptions from you above posts so we will work in the python33 directoryopen notepad not idle or word notepad  lets keep it simpleto startcreate a new file pick a name any name for now but give it a .py extension and save it to the \python33 directoryon the save dialog look at the bottom see Encoding set that to UTF-8and save the blank file  okay that will save use some time later and now I know the encoding will be correctnow lets write our scritpfile = open(README.TXT r)for line in file:    print(line)file.close()print(that was the complete file printed line by line)for a in range(10):   print()print(that was just to move the text up)file = open(README.TXT r)print(file.readline())file.readline()file.readline()print(file.readline())print(4 lines that read but only 2 print)save thatthat readme.txt should already be in that directory unless you deleted italso in that directory is python.exenow go pack to the cmd windows that I had you openyou are in that directortype diryou will see a list of all the files an you should see the file you just created the readme.txt and python.exe. and a few others too.for now the 3 I mentioned are all we neednow in the cmd type this command and press enterpython yourFileNameHere.pyafter you press enter you will see a lot of text flash across the screen  and then you will be back at the promptnow lets look at that text and the code we just wrote file = open(README.TXT r)for line in file:    print(line)file.close()print(that was the complete file printed line by line)that printed every thing in the filefor a in range(10):   print()print(that was just to move the text up 10 blank lines)as the last print says just printing 10 blank linesfile = open(README.TXT r)print(file.readline())file.readline()file.readline()print(file.readline())print(4 lines that read but only 2 print)now this is answering some of your questionthere are 4 line that are read from the filebut only 2 are printedif you open the readme.txt file you see that the first 4 lines areThis is Python version 3.3.2============================Copyright (c) 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011now this was an over simple example but this is how python really workspython.exe is the python interpreter an that is where your programs (scripts) runand it will only do what you tell it to do you do not tell it to print it will not printyou tell it to read a line in the file it reads the line and that is it.to access the interpreter type python and press enterthat is a python shell just like in idle but with out idle and its added featuresif you type these command you will see the same output you would in idlefile = open(README.TXT r)file.readline()but you are just running one line of code at a time and not the whole fileyou want to run the file from here type import yourFileNameHereyou will see the same output as running outside the interpreter now press ctl-z and then enter to exit the interpreter back to the cmd promptthat is the short of it so that shows you some of the differences in the shell to a script and why they chose idle instead of thisthis makes it hard to explain I know I just tried an probably just confused you., Resolved,1

Sunday September 29th 2013 6:07 am -04:00,this is the function from the stater code it is not in the driver file it is in you a3.py file.def board_contains_word_in_row(board word):     (list of list of str str) -> bool    Return True if and only if one or more of the rows of the board contains    word.    Precondition: board has at least one row and one column and word is a    valid word.    >>> board_contains_word_in_row([[A N T T] [X S O B]] SOB)    True        for row_index in range(len(board)):        if word in make_str_from_row(board row_index):            return True    return False, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 6:27 am -04:00,your are doing a lot of work that you do not need to.  first replace you word in row function with the one I posted from the starter code it works and in the long run will save you a lot of time.but before you can test this function you need to complete the make_str_from_row() function as it is a helper function to this one, Unresolved,1
Sunday September 29th 2013 6:43 am -04:00,If no one else has explained your index out of range by morning I will come back and walk you through that code its 3:30am where I am and I need some sleepbut for the question of an empty string returning True it is just like in the last assignment for is valid sequence.  where an empty sequence returned True.an empty string is still a string and if you ask the questionvariable IN variableit will return True becauseString In String will be Trueit is one of those times where the value is not matched exactly  every string is a string even an empty stringa little confusing but just the way it is, Unresolved,1
Sunday September 29th 2013 2:54 pm -04:00,good morning Him  as promised lets look at the code and see if we can explain the error    match_word=False    for i in range(len(board)): # len(board) = 2        for i in range(len(word)): # len(word) = 3  # <<--- this one is part of the out of range error            for word in board[i]: # len(board[i]) = 4 # <<--- this one is also part of the problemthe above 3 for loop all loop over a different range  the inner 2 are in conflict in thatboard has a length of 2 and the length of a word can be more then 2in the second for loop i will count to the length of the wordin the third for loop you set word to the value of the index in board[i]but the board has only 2 rows and i will be grater then the number or rows on the third iteration of the loop and so the index out of range errorif you delete both you will be back on the right track.  I see what you weretrying to do you wanted to check the letter in word with the letters in the rowone at a time to look for a match but that is a long and complicated thing todo and you have to watch the indexes closely your if line below almost works remember back to assignment 2the smaller dna in the bigger dna  you would do the same hereword will be the smaller the word can never be longer then the rowso you would check if word in board[i]: but there is still a small problemboard[i] is a list of letters  so if you reused your make_str function thenboard[i] would be a string and it could work                if board[i]==word:                    match_word=True    return match_wordboard_contains_word_in_row([[A N T T] [X S O B]] SOB)index out of rangeit was a good try and for practice you might want to see if you can do a word in row with out using the in operator  it will be hard matching just a substring letter my letter to a larger sequence but it will teach a lot., Unresolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 3:09 pm -04:00,actually you can alter the elements of a list in that way  using the = operator will give that element a new value. which for the problem is not the right answer.  but you could use for example += to add to the value in that index.  usage l[1] = l[1] + 10 is the same as l[1] += 10 just short hand.now you can use the methods you mentioned but that can get complicated if you want to change items in the middle of the list or multiple items in different places but simple reassignment will make your life a lot easier   , Unresolved,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 10:10 am -04:00,Sorry you made a mistake a blew the examI like your analogy of safety warning requirementsbut there were safety warnings  1. this topic has been discussed on the forum from almost week 1 with responses from TAs and Staff stating that it would be 3 hours and only 1 attempt2. there is a big announcement on the front page3. they sent out not 1 but 2 emails stating the the conditions of the exam.4. after you click the link in the side bar for the final exam you see information that tells you that you have only one attempt expressed in 2 different ways5. and finally you need to click a big blue button labeled attempt exam to even start the exam.so 5 safety warnings with 4 official and 1 unofficialto use an analogy this situation is likebefore you go to a factory everyone saying that it is dangerousthe factory sends you 2 letters saying it is dangerousyou get to the factory and there is a big sign that says danger out frontbut you decide to hop the fencethen there is that room that everyone is talking about and you have been waiting to see what was in there you know it is dangerour becuse you have been waiting for this for 7 weeks.you go in and then there is still a small sign the tell you that you only get to be here this one time and only this one time and a counter telling you that you have made 0/1 attempts at it. and then you see a the last warning that says press to startand then even though you have not finished reading the manual you are not wearing your safety equipment and dont really have the time to operate the machine you press the button anyway.Do I fell sorry for you?  I diduntil you said that you made a mistake but it was Courseras fault because they should have done more then make several posts in the forum about it send you 2 emails post a big announcement on the front page said that they should have stopped you from hopping the fence so to speak so that you would have been forced to see the announcement and then even if you did hop the fence they should have done more then make you click a link to the final exam page (where they note on that page that you have only 1 attempt at the exam) and then click a second button on that page to start the exam. and all of that was not enough they should have made it even more clear   , Resolved,31

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 2:18 pm -04:00,Kevin I am sorry I guess I am having trouble keeping all the different post straight I need to stop opening more then one tab at a time lets do this again and let me fix what I posted the first timethis is our board_contains_word_in_row function this code was supplied to us and we can reuse this code with only a few modifications     for row_index in range(len(board)):        if word in make_str_from_row(board row_index):            return True    return Falsethe first thing we need to do is change the word row to columnwe do that in 3 places simple change in the for loop and on the if line that is the only 2 places to replace row with columnfor now change nothing elsenext we need to make 1 last change to make this a working function for the columnand it is a small change I mean really small you just need to add 3 little character to you for loop [0]you need to use a index in the range/len of the loop  right now you loop over the length of the boardbut when searching the column you need to loop over the columns and there can be more or less columns then rows  but the rows on the board will tell you how many columns there are  if a row has 4 character in it then that means we have 4 columns  also we know that every board has a first rowboard[0] is the location of row 1board[1] is the location of row 2and so onlen(board) will tell you the length of the boardto find the length of a row you just need to len(board[0])change the for loop in the code above to use the length of a row instead of the length of a boardand again Im sorry for posting in the wrong thread  my first 2 post were for making a string from a columnbut on the bright side now you have the information to make a string from a column and this function uses that functionagain Sorry for my mistake , Unresolved,1

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 8:51 pm -04:00,yes the word in column and word in row functions will need to reuse the make str functions so that they can workand when you get to it the boards contains word function it will use both word in functions and the num words on board uses board contains so you will need to have all the functions in one file and loaded and running before you can test any of them., Unresolved,0

Saturday October 5th 2013 4:06 pm -04:00,you are doing a few things that are not really necessary example        for letters in line:            second.append(letters.rstrip(/n))you do that with this line         line = list(line.rstrip(/n))and then you need to correct this line to reflect your new append line        first.append(second)but if you just fix one little thing it looks like it will work anywaya newline character is  and not /n , Resolved,1
