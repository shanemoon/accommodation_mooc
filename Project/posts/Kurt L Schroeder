Monday August 19th 2013 3:44 pm -04:00,>>> z = 5>>> y = z + 1>>> z = 10I believe this is the problem you are asking about.  as the program executes one line at a timethe first line z is assigned the value of 5.the second line y is assigned the value of z + 1  which is 5 + 1 or 6in the third line z is assigned the value of 10.  the program endsline 2 is never repeated so the value stays at 6.and line 3 changed the value from 5 to 10 so 10 it is.this is my understanding of this code snippet., Resolved,3
Monday August 19th 2013 8:49 pm -04:00,x = 3y = 5x = ythe way I understand it is .... Python looks at the right side of the = sign first finds the value thenassigns that value to the left of the = sign. soline one : x = 3 : find right value 3 and assign that to the variable on the left. now x refers to 3.line two : y = 5 : find right value 5 and assign that to the variable on the left. now y refers to 5.line three : x = y : python looks at the y on the right side of the = first then finds the value which is 5 and assigns the 5 to the x on the left. so the value of x equals 5.hopefully I will be better at explaining it in the near future. ,None,6

Friday September 6th 2013 11:50 pm -04:00,is there a way to input a question and have your answer return a  function call?example  def intention(action):     (str) ->str    Return a call to the appropiate function based on the result    of action        if action == a:        myfunction(a)    else:        myfunction(b)action = input(what game do you want to play?  a or b >)I hope I asked this question clearly enough to understand.myfunction() is user function. dont use the print(function) in an example.in other words if the user types in an a run one block of codeif something else run other code.,None,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 12:46 am -04:00,Tom the program you typed worked fine. :)I still am having problems getting it to run a function I wrote. I can get it to print anything I want. I cant get it to loadmy function. I will post the code I am experimenting with and let you know what I want it to do.### combat.pyimport random loads The standard random module implements a random number generator.    Usage is simple:    import random    print random.random()    This prints a random floating point number in the    range [0 1) (that is between 0 and 1 including 0.0 but always    smaller than 1.0).    There are also many other specialized generators in this module such as:    randrange(a b) chooses an integer in the range [a b).    uniform(a b) chooses a floating point number in the range [a b).        def combat(player_num computer_num):    (intint) -> str    Return you hit!!oryour attack was blocked!oryou missed    depending on the values in (player_num computer_num)    >>>> combat(105)    you hit !!    >>>> combat(77)    your hit was blocked !    >>>> combat(48)    you missed !        if player_num > computer_num:        return(you hit!!)    elif player_num == computer_num:        return(your attack was blocked!)    else:        return(you missed)        ## >>>combat(random.randrange(112) random.randrange(110))## this is an example function call to combat() using the    ## standard random module.this part is all messed up but maybe you can see what I am trying to do.I want to come out of one function and call my combat function with these parameterscombat(random.randrange(112) random.randrange(110)) .def call():    action = input(what game do you want to play?  a or b >)    if action == a:        return combat(random.randrange(112) random.randrange(110))    if action == b:        return myFunctionB()         def myFunctionB():   print(myFunctionB was called)I am having problems with function calls so I am practicing them. thanks for your input,None,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 2:08 am -04:00,when I run it it just goes back to to>>>with no error.and no output.this is how I recreated this...save the combat.py as a file to your drive then open and run it in IDLE.then run this in IDLE>>>combat(random.randrange(112) random.randrange(110))examples of my output:>>> combat(random.randrange(112) random.randrange(110))your attack was blocked!>>> combat(random.randrange(112) random.randrange(110))you missed>>> combat(random.randrange(112) random.randrange(110))you hit!!what I am trying to do is...  have a function that if you type a will return the same set of results as typing ..>>>combat(random.randrange(112) random.randrange(110))into IDLEand return something else when b is typed in.,None,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:37 pm -04:00,yes a slight problem but I am trying to figure stuff out. playing with the code helps melearn. I have tried a couple of different ways and still failed  but I will learn it somehow :),None,0

Sunday September 22nd 2013 3:03 pm -04:00,I found this problem while playing with IDLE.  I was practicing the append when I tried to append more than 1 item I got an error  so I tried Brackets around it. .. like this >>>note1 = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12]>>>note2 = [now and again]>>>note1.append(now and again)Traceback (most recent call last):  File C:\Python33AZestexp.py line 3 in <module>    note1.append(now and again)TypeError: append() takes exactly one argument (3 given)### after seeing this I put brackets around it and tried it again.>>>note1.append([now and again])>>>note1[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 [now and again]]#### a list within a list.. after playing with it a little longer I found out how### to show items in the nested list.>>> note1 [12] [2]againso I concluded that the code below is slicing the A  off the ABas far as this part of the code goes when the statement  a = b was entered that made a and b mutable.so what ever you do to b you do to a.  you can test this by putting a print(a b) after the b[1] = AB statement.b[1] = AB print(a b)a[1] = a[1][0]so I concluded that the code below is slicing the A  off the ABb[1] = ABa[1] = a[1][0]well anyway that is my take on it. I was thinking on making a simple little program that will multiply2 numbers up to 10 * 10 for example:>>> times_table [7] [4]28just for fun., Resolved,0
