Wednesday August 28th 2013 7:35 pm -04:00,Hi AllI am not a programmer I am just starting with this course although I have worked in technology (mostly business consulting) in the past years.The question is I know that once a function has finished executing and passes the returned result to another function when reusing functions the original function result drops from memory and that memory block is not used anymore.However the memory has been hit more times than if it the function was programmed without function reused.Â The below is an experiment I did the half_rectangle_area gets 3 int active memory blocks and one gone (int:8 the result of the reusable rectangle_area function)while the following function programmed without reusing another function hits the memory only 3 times the ones still active.My question is does this extra hit even though it has been deleted from memory affect execution when the functions are bigger? would a function programmed from scratch have a better use of memory - not taking into consideration coding comfort - ?Thanks in advance.Mateo., Unresolved,2
