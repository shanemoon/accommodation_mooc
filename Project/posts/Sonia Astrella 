Tuesday August 27th 2013 10:45 pm -04:00,For step 5 I understand how to build the body of the function for each of get_hours get_minutes and get_seconds but how should I include the range so that if I test for get_hours(150000) I wont get 41? The range for get_hours is 0 to 23 inclusive. I already tried to include range(023) but I still getting 41 when I test for get_hours(150000).Please help me. , Resolved,0
