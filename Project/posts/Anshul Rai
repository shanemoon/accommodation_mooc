Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:46 am -04:00,I submitted my assignment and got 41/41. The assignment was complete and checked on the a1_gui.py too. But the posts here reveal that an incomplete submission is also resulting in 41/41. Is there a problem with the automated tester. Do we submit again?, Resolved,0
