Tuesday August 20th 2013 2:13 pm -04:00,The problem summary: I get no sound in Safari v6.0.5 in either Flash or html 5. I am able to play the videos in Chrome however.  But Im wondering if there are steps I can take to fix Safari.Steps to reproduce:play any video lecture, Unresolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:56 pm -04:00,I can open another window in Safari while the class lecture is playing with no sound say a youtube window and hear any video in that window with sound.  So it doesnt seem like anything is muted., Unresolved,0

I wont be able to get the certificate or whatever the recognition is for passing because I had not expected the work load but Im in it for the learning and not the rubber stamp. That said Im enjoying the challenging nature and the high quality., Resolved,2
Sunday September 22nd 2013 8:36 pm -04:00,I thought the fastest way to finish this would be test for this case so I had theses lines in my def...if is_valid_sequence == :        return Trueor return False whichever way works with the vague directions BUT if I enter >>> is_valid_sequence()I just get an empty prompt back.  Why dont I get the expected return of True?, Resolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 8:56 pm -04:00,I tried it and I see that answer but I humbly admit that didnt let any light in. I tried testing to see if is_valid_sequence was equal to that reserved word but that didnt work either. I tried if not is_valid_sequence still nothing. Im more than happy to review the lectures if you can tell me where to look otherwise Im still left scratching my head., Resolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 9:07 pm -04:00,No reason for you to apologize. Thanks for trying to help. I accept that the fault lies with me being dense somewhere. I just have no clue where.When I try mine and all the variations Ive thought of for mine it simply returns an empty prompt >>> no true no false no nothing.I get None when doing print but I cant seem to find a way to test for none. Everything I have looked at says if is_valid_sequence == :        return Trueshould be valid but it fails with no return. Ive tried using the debugger but I also get nothing beyond the knowledge of nope that doesnt work., Resolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 10:40 am -04:00,Wow I was testing the wrong thing. I cant believe I didnt see that all this time. I had a feeling I was going to feel like it was obvious when I finally got it but this is a surprising new level.  Thanks guys., Resolved,0
