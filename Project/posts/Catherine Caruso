Monday August 19th 2013 3:17 am -04:00,I had the same problem and just re-typing didnt work for me either. Re-watch the part of the video where the instructor *really quickly* uses a certain keyboard command to re-run that line of code (just re-typing it didnt work for me I actually had to Control P or what ever it was back to that line and re-run the original line to make it change). And they go over it so quickly on the video I actually had to re-watch it a couple of times before I caught it - the instructor will say the keyboard command for her OS and the screen will display a footnote on the workspace of the instructors IDLE window that gives alternatives for other operating systems)., Resolved,1
