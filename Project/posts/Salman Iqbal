Tuesday August 20th 2013 2:34 pm -04:00,Usman just follow the lectures. Install Python software on your laptop/PC so that you can practice during the lecutre. The first few weeks will be very easy to understand n follow. Just stick to the flow of lectures/exercises. :)Salman (Karachi/Abu Dhabi),None,1

Saturday September 7th 2013 1:27 pm -04:00,Sanne you just have to import the area_hero function from the module triangle.py. Since it is not defined explicitly you have to define it first and then return the function all in a single line.return module_name.function_name(arguments) :)Hope that helps.TA you all are doing a great job!
