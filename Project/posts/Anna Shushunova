Saturday September 14th 2013 5:29 pm -04:00,Copy your functions code in here and add:is_valid_sequence(ATCGGC)as a last string, Unresolved,1
Saturday September 14th 2013 6:09 pm -04:00,Anne Im so sorry to hear about it because its almost works. All the problem is some unnecessary spaces. And to work in vizualizer you shoud remove all empty space at the start of a string and then press tab tab tab again (tis a cause of char refers to  A and the function executes and returns True). Good luck to you with the rest of the Assignment anyway., Unresolved,1
