Monday September 9th 2013 8:29 am -04:00,Could someone kindly clarify what Ive done wrong since Ive gotten the same answer in Python by writing bothprint(str(int(bro) + int(sis)) + sibs) AND print(str(int(bro + sis)) + sibs)?Though people have clarified it above my output is still different. This is what Ive written which has resulted in a seemingly correct answer (hopefully you can see my screen image attached)...>>>bro = 4>>>sis = 2>>>sibs =  siblings!>>>print(str(int(bro + sis)) + sibs)6 siblings!Thanks for your help!, Resolved,0
