Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:21 am -04:00,I think its too avoid guesswork. If youre allowed to try the quiz 5 times you could increment your score each time with blind guessing. However if the questions shift each try and you have to redo the problem then guessing wont really help you out. And at the same time if you have learned the material then yes its a bit more work to have to redo problems but then again youre getting multiple opportunities to correct your mistakes. Seems like a fair compromise between giving people a fair shot and preventing cheating. , Unresolved,2
