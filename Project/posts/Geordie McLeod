Saturday October 5th 2013 8:03 am -04:00,Im having trouble reading the file full stop. I continually get the message:words = open(wordlist.txt r)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#15> line 1 in <module>    words = open(wordlist.txt r)FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: wordlist.txtI have all the .py files and text files in the same directory and even put IDLE and python launcher in there as well but no joy!Hamishs advice was great but even importing os didnt make it work.I have a sense I must be missing something so obvious it will be annoying but its a bit difficult to attempt the assignment if I cant read the files.I am using a Mac if that helps - i.e. is there some quirk with the directory system?, Unresolved,0
