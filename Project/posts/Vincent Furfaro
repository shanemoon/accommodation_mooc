Tuesday August 20th 2013 1:48 pm -04:00,The Raspberry Pi is very small and cheap($25 or $35) Linux computer that was originally developed to encourage the learning of Computer Science. It is very hackable in the sense that it uses open source software and there Input/Output pins add on boards etc. If you are interested in Linux electronics servers hacking computers learning to program or just a cheap computer to play with this is a great deal. There many others uses for the Pi and the Pi community is large and helpful. Hope this helps. Good Luck!,None,0
