Monday August 19th 2013 3:04 pm -04:00,Ive been using python on linux(ubuntu). It came pre loaded with python 3.3 . Ive been able to successfully work with the python shell simply by typing python3.3 in my terminal . I wanted to try the last part of the last video which is user defined function loaded from a file. so i first created a file named test.py which contained my function fu(x). The i tried running it using the following techniques1) $ python3.3 test.py2) $ python test.py3) adding  the lines #!/usr/bin/python3.3#Filename : test.pyto the beginning of my file .. changing it to executable and running it using $ ./test.pyNONE of those techniques have imported the function fu(x) back to my python shell , Resolved,0
