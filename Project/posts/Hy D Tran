Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:43 pm -04:00,I noticed that they dont talk a lot about debugging.Baby steps:  Try something really simple converting seconds to minutes in the IDLE environment.  If you have seconds the rule is 60 seconds/minute so seconds/60 should give you minutes.>>>sec=30>>>min=sec/60Do you get the result you expect?Now wrap this in a function.  Remember indents are 4 spaces.  Ill skip the comments (even though they are very important).def myminutes(seconds):    minutes=seconds/60    return minutesTest it out.  It should do **exactly** what you tested in the IDLE environment.  (Purists will say that you could save a line by typing return seconds/60)Dont give up; hang in there.    , Resolved,1
Saturday September 14th 2013 10:19 am -04:00,So heres a hint on how to debug programs:For simple programs create several test cases.  Manually (that is in your head with pencil and paper) step through the program and see what is happening.If that doesnt help this is what I do (its really ugly and good programmers dont do what Im about to suggest):  Put in a print statement in each loop and in each if to print(I am at step # and I expect to have  variable) (or something like that).Your reasoning is OK and your syntax is good--but your syntax is not executing what you think its executing., Unresolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:38 pm -04:00,You ask:flanders_file= open(flanders_filename r) #what does flanders_file refer to?You can find that out easily by typing type(flanders_file)You will get class _io.txtwrapper.  This tells you that the flanders_file object is an object with the type class; more specifically _io.  A class is a type of data object just like a number (int or float) is a type of data object just like a string is a type of data object.  The _io type is predefined as input/output object.  The variable flanders_file points to the actual file flanders_filename.  You can apply the methods read readline readlines etc. to the object flanders_file so when you do flanders_file.readline() Python goes and finds the file that flanders_file points to (in this case flanders_filename).  It then goes and reads 1 line and returns it to you., Resolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 4:32 pm -04:00,Note that the instructors said that they are monitoring the answers and would not grade problematic problems.  So if there is a particularly difficult or tricky question they may choose to have it be an ungraded problem.Easier to just hold all results until the instructors look at it than to give you a score then retroactively change the score.Just my opinion., Unresolved,2
Thursday October 3rd 2013 12:46 pm -04:00,It would be helpful if you would indicate where in the lecture you are beginning to be lost (around time 19:00 minutes for example).There are many ways of counting occurrences of grades and putting them into bins.  What Prof. Gries chooses to do is to use the `//` division method to bin the grades.He notices that if you take a grade of 63.5 by doing 63.5 // 10 you get 6.0.  If you have a list of bins (range_counts is a list of bins) the 7th bin contains grades from 60 to 69 so you can increment the list range_counts at the 7th position (index of 6).When he does range_counts=[0]*11 he gets range_counts=[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0].Now the for loop goes and looks at each grade in the list.  Lets say the first grade read is 63.5 (in the lecture its 77.5).  So we add 1 to the count of grades between 60 and 69 inclusive.  You do grade//10.0 to get 6.0 and you add 1 to the 7th element (index of 6) of range_counts:  range_counts[index]=range_counts[index]+1.  Your range_counts list would now be [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0].  Now the for loop goes and reads the next grade.  If the next grade is 7 the index is 0 and the range_counts list becomes [1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0].  The for loop continues until all the grades have been read and the bins updated.Hope this explanation helped., Unresolved,2
