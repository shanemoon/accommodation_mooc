Tuesday September 10th 2013 8:11 pm -04:00,I realize we havent been instructed on this subject yet but I included assertion statements in most of the definitions I wrote for this assignment for example to test that passed parameters are strings are valid sequences etcetera.The grader is failing both get_complement and get_complementary_sequence with assertion errors.  My get_complementary_sequence has no assertions of its own but does call get_complement so it appears the problem rests solely with get_complement.  My get_complement asserts that the passed parameter both tests true for is_valid_sequence and has a length of 1.  My is_valid_sequence passed the grader.Ive tested everything in IDLE including the example in the handout sequences with multiple occurrences of each nucleotide and invalid sequences containing either lower case or invalid characters and everything works correctly.  Is the grader sending invalid strings to the definitions in step 4 expecting a result which is not an assertion error ?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 8:22 pm -04:00,Have found the problem and have now passed all tests with the grader.An empty string () is to be considered a valid sequence.  This wasnt stated in the handout and was left to us to intuit but has since been confirmed in this staff-replied forum post:A2 FAQSince my get_complement asserted a string length of 1 it previously failed when passed an empty string by the grader.Since my get_complementary_sequence called get_complement it also previously failed.I wasnt sure what was wrong since my is_valid_sequence had passed the grader.  It turns out my is_valid_sequence evaluated an empty string as valid which was an oversight of mine that just happened to work correctly in this case., Resolved,0
