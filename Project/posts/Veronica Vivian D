Monday September 23rd 2013 11:41 pm -04:00,Hi Yuemin LiAh I think I know the answer as I recall last week lectures the stop parametre in the range function is the value that the function approaches but not included. which mean that in the example shift_left function the i will stop at 3 and approaches 4 but do not equal to 4. Thats why the for loop will not evaluate L[4]!Hope this help! :)Veronica/, Resolved,0
