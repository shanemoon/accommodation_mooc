Sunday September 8th 2013 2:41 pm -04:00,да правилно ги броиш не знам защо не ти отчита верни отговори ако говориш за последните 3 въпроса от теста може би защото забравяш главния фрейм т.е. програмата с първата си стъпка влиза в него т.е. трябва да броиш това което казваш +1 отговорите на последните 3 задачи са съответно 133,None,1

Wednesday September 25th 2013 2:34 am -04:00,fellows because of your post Ive made for myself next conclusions:1.my code is good because the driver runs it2.my code is not perfect because doesnt make sence whether in text files has one final blank line or notI get 37/37 points after I made if-check to check whether there is  or not. Which MEANS only one thing - test machine wants from us to make a check for p.s.: Ive downloaded several times the text files and I opened them with notepad notepad++ wordpad MS word Python shell etc. and they all DO have  or blank line or whatever you want to name it at the end, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 2:49 am -04:00,I was did it just like that but not from laziness.And my ask was just about to know what I was doing wrong to know and correct my mistake not to get just the 37/37 score.The input file used in the test case (which you cannot see) - I think it is confusing to test with file which is different from the file we have to work with because if the file didnt include a newline character at the end of it I would not just lop the last character everyone wouldnt. This lopping wouldnt give me appropriate answer and that would blink me the red lamp to correct my code., Resolved,0
