Wednesday September 11th 2013 6:30 pm -04:00,Am I the only one feeling as the vid courses are way more easy-going and reachable than the difficulty level of the assignments??Like in Assignment 1 video courses were quite understandable and easy to take but the assignments difficulty was 10 levels up.
