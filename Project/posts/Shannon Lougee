Saturday August 24th 2013 2:03 pm -04:00,Hi GunesIm brand new at programming so I can only tell you what my understanding of the video lecture is.Integer division denoted by the operator // (not / as you wrote above) gives you only the whole number part of the answer.  Two is the whole number part of the answer.  Since 12 divided by 5 equals 2 2/5 (two and two fifths) two is the whole part of the number and the two fifths is a fraction that is left off.  Presumably its because integers are positive and negative whole numbers (plus zero) and therefore since were doing integer division the program returns an integer answer.  Perhaps someone who knows more about programming could confirm that?Hope this helps and good luck!, Resolved,0
Saturday August 24th 2013 2:10 pm -04:00,I just noticed on another thread that removing the fraction/decimal part of the result is called truncating.  Thank you to those who posted that helpful info., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:52 am -04:00,AngelIm with you.  This is tougher than I anticipated.  The biggest problem for me is the amount of time it is taking--far more than what they estimated in the course description.Anyone else here finding that it is taking excessively more time than was predicted by course description?ThanksShannon,None,4
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:26 am -04:00,Thanks for your response.  Do you know if it clicked for those students so that the time needed was reduced?,None,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:40 am -04:00,I think Id be fine if I had more time but unfortunately that is not the case.  I also think I need more practice however I dont have the book.  Im trying to decide whether or not to get it.  ,None,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:50 am -04:00,Thanks Etienne.  I really appreciate it.  I probably should have taken a little time to find those myself.  Is there an answer key so that if I do the exercises I can compare to the correct way of coding? ,None,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:52 am -04:00,Also could you tell me what happens if I take more than 7 or 8 weeks to complete the course?  Will there be a point when I can no longer access the exercises or assignments?,None,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:01 pm -04:00,That would be great but dont do it for just my benefit.  Im uncertain if Im going to be able to continue due to time constraints.  Im going to make that decision next week.  However if you decide to do it to benefit everyone as well as to enhance the course then should I continue I will certainly use the key as a resource.,None,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 5:59 pm -04:00,Etienne--Thank you!!  You rock!  Its really kind of you to go through all that trouble.,None,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 8:46 pm -04:00,Etienne -- Ive worked through all the exercises for weeks 1 and 2.  They were all quite easy until I got to the rounding exercise.  I tried to think of a way to do it without using the round built-in.  When my brain began to hurt I checked your code and found that you had indeed called the built-in.  Any ideas on how to do it without calling round?  (Perhaps thats beyond the scope of this class...)BTW I did the first assignment and I did just fine on it.  I thought it would be much harder. I feel like things are starting to click as some have suggested.  I guess when I start to tackle week 3 well find out for sure.  :-),None,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:04 am -04:00,I dont understand either of your programs but perhaps I will later on.  Thanks anyways.,None,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 5:43 pm -04:00,Arnold -- thanks so much.  I havent had time to go back and review the code and your explanation yet but I hope to do it after Im completely caught up.Etienne - since I havent given up yet any chance you could post the answer key for the week 4 practice?  Im stuck on #2 and would love to see how you would code it.,None,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 1:02 pm -04:00,Etienne - Ive figured out most of them and after doing the week 4 exercise I think I can do # 2 so I might not need help.,None,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 9:46 am -04:00,Hi Arnold Lau if youre still following this thread.  I finally reviewed your thorough explanation (still not completely caught up with the class but close to it) and it now makes perfect sense.  I cant thank you enough for going through the trouble and Im totally impressed with your cleverness!  Thank you! * 1000000!,None,1

Saturday September 7th 2013 12:50 pm -04:00,Thanks to all those offering encouragement.  I havent thrown in the towel and hopefully Ill get caught up in the next few days.  Angel if youre still out there Im finding a wiki book to be helpful.  Perhaps it will help you as well:  Non-Programmers Tutorial for Python 3.,None,1
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:57 am -04:00,Angel  I had the same exact issue.  We all learn best with context and without a more detailed tour of the programming environment I was confused.  This webpage helped me to understand the difference between those two windows.  It is for Python 2 which is the older version and not the one we are using in this class but the concepts are the same.  Jen and Paul are going at a fast pace - possibly because theyre fitting a full semesters worth of content into 7 weeks.  For me having no background with so much new jargon has been tough as well as time consuming.  In addition Im exercising areas of my brain that quite frankly I havent used much in recent years.  So you are not the only one struggling and not the only older student either.  I hope you will stop being so hard on yourself and I also hope you wont give up.  Perhaps you can look for other resources that go at a slower pace and provide more of the building blocks.  This class is not the only place where you can learn to program.  Heres a guy on youtube that is pretty good at teaching Python 3 in an easy-to-understand way.  Also do you have a library where you are?  If you feel you are too far behind maybe you can gather more of the building blocks by using other resources and then take this class again next time it is offered???Good luck! ,None,1
Saturday September 14th 2013 7:03 pm -04:00,Im trying to do the practice exercises for week 4 in the course Wiki and attempting to follow the Function Design Recipe.  How do I create examples and type contracts when I use the input function?Heres my attempt at the valid_phone_number function:def valid_phone_number():         (???) -> ???

Monday September 30th 2013 1:31 pm -04:00,Shreyash - You are a mechanical engineer.  Comparing yourself to the average beginner is a bit unfair.I agree that our first anonymous poster could be a little more polite but I agree with him/her that this course is not well designed for a beginner.  Furthermore I suspect Jen and Paul are being paid by the University of Toronto for their efforts.,None,0

Monday September 30th 2013 5:18 pm -04:00,Im not saying theyre bad teachers.  I think theyre good teachers.  Im just agreeing that this course is not meant for absolute beginners.  I meet the course prerequisites yet Im spending a great deal time more on the course than was estimated.  Based on what Im seeing in the forums Im not the only person.  Its no wonder so many feel frustrated when people like Shreyash who is a mechanical engineer who has done already programming and who has taken other CS courses is purported to be a beginner.  If hes the audience this beginner class is geared towards than I believe the description should be modified.Context is key to successful learning.  For those of us with little to zero technical background we dont have the context that would be helpful.  Perhaps logical thinking is not my strong suit as others have suggested but I dont think thats the case.  And if you are suggesting that Im not motivated than you are making the wrong assumption about me.,None,0
Monday September 30th 2013 7:17 pm -04:00,Sheyash - No worries and thank you for your kind response.  I directed some frustration at you so please accept my apologies as well.  I didnt mean to sound so testy.  I think MOOCs are analogous to the one-room classroom.  We students represent a wide variety of backgrounds levels of education and abilities.  Fortunately so many who are several grades ahead have been incredibly generous with their time in helping the rest of us.Alain thank you once again for your encouragement and support.  You have been a huge help--more than you can know.  Ive relied greatly on your postings in multiple forums.  You are a huge asset to this community of on-line learners!,None,1
Monday September 30th 2013 8:15 pm -04:00,Alain  you clearly have a lot of knowledge about CS so I hope you wont be offended if I suggest that you might not be qualified to make the assessment that this class is clearly laid out for beginners since you are not one.  Also I dont believe it should be assumed that we all know how computer hardware works and if that is a prerequisite it would be useful to list it in the course description.Anonymous Id be interested in knowing your background and your prior knowledge about CS.For me the videos are easy enough to follow but I learn best by doing.  If each video was followed by small coding assignments  that require immediate application of the new knowledge the information would stick better.   The practice that a previous student posted in the course wiki along with Etiennes answer keys have been helpful but they dont provide immediate reinforcement for each video.,None,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 5:29 am -04:00,Anonymous - did you post and then delete?  I had a message in my inbox from you that I want to respond to but now I cant find it.  In any event your description of your approach to the class as well as the lengthy process involved is very similar to my own and I would agree that as a beginner I can do this class under those conditions (along with the help of people like Alain).  However doing it in the time given in the course description is a very different story.Anyways I didnt intend to spend this much time in the forum debating.Best to all!,None,0

Thursday September 26th 2013 11:57 am -04:00,If the following function is called and one of the if statements is true its return statement is executed and the code exits and doesnt return Exactly 100.def compare_100(num):    if num < 100:        return Less than 100    if num > 100:        return Greater than 100    return Exactly 100But the following code doesnt exit even when the first if statement is True.grade1 = 70grade2 = 80if grade1 >= 50:    print(You passed a course with grade:  grade 1)if grade2 >= 50:    print(You passed a course with grade:  grade 2)Does this mean that everything at the same indentation that follows an if statement is part of that if statement unless it is another if statement?Also in the compare_100 function if the first if statement is true does the second if statement also evaluate the num entered?  (Obviously it will evaluate to false if the first if statement is true and therefore wont execute its return.)Thanks for any clarification you can provide., Unresolved,0

Thursday September 26th 2013 5:46 pm -04:00,Heres the problem:valid_numberWrite a function that takes user input and returns Valid number if the user has entered digits and Invalid number if the user enters anything else.Heres my attempt:def valid_number():        number = input(Enter a number: )           for char in number:        if char in 1234567890:            return Valid number        return Invalid numberIts not working.  It returns Valid number even when I input 555kkkk.  I understand (I think) that as soon as the if statement gets to the first digit it executes the return statement which causes the program to exit.  I dont know how to solve the problem.  Could someone give me a *really big* hint?  Its driving me crazy but I need to move past this quickly.Thanks in advance!!!,None,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 6:20 pm -04:00,I thought about  is_valid_sequence but it returns a Bool.  (Would it be okay to post the code I wrote for that?)  Im not sure how to translate that into returning a str (Valid Number or Invalid Number) or how to use it to check each character of the input.isdigit() is promising (I should have thought of that) but Im having the same problem with the next problem in the week 4 practice.  Heres that problem:valid_phone_numberWrite a function that takes user input and return Valid phone number if the user has entered 10 digits and any number of hyphens and Invalid phone number if the user has entered anything else.valid_phone_number might have hyphens so Im not sure how isdigit() can be used for that one?,None,0

Thursday September 26th 2013 7:18 pm -04:00,EtienneThank you.  I came up with the following code with all your hand holding.  It seems to be working.  I used len(of_the_input) instead of 10 because I thought the number could be different lengths based  one whether country or area codes are entered.def valid_phone_number():        phone_num = input(Enter your phone number: )    chars_in_phone = 0            for char in phone_num:        if char not in 0123456789-:            return Invalid phone number        if char.isdigit() or char == -:            chars_in_phone = chars_in_phone + 1    if chars_in_phone == len(phone_num):        return Valid phone number(I know the second if statement could have been the opposite of the first.)Feel free to let me know how I can improve it.Shannon,None,0

Thursday September 26th 2013 7:41 pm -04:00,Oh duh... I should have gone back and reread the problem.  We dont dial the phone numbers here with the hyphens but often they are included when writing the number or when filling out a form online.  We also use () to surround the area code.,None,0
