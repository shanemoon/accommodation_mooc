Friday September 6th 2013 5:50 pm -04:00,Please help-- Assgn#1--I started out by doing this: In this assignment we are providing starter code that contains some function headers and docstrings and one complete function. You should download it here: a1.py.In IDLE select File -> Open to open it. So when I open file a1.py in IDLE I get a new pop up window with def seconds_difference etc etc etc .. I then type in the return statement at the end of the docstring and when I hit Run-> Run Module I get a pop up message asking me Source MustBe Saved  OK to Save? & so I hot Save and then get an error msg pop up that reads[Erno 13] Permission denied: C:\\Python33\\a1.py-- nothing happens..  When I copy and paste the following in IDLE to test calling the function I get:>>> seconds_difference(3600.0 1800.0)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#0> line 1 in <module>    seconds_difference(3600.0 1800.0)NameError: name seconds_difference is not definedI cant get off of square 1 though I did OKAY on the Exercises for Week#2.  Can someone perhaps make a suggestion of guide me?  Im also signed up on the Learn TO Program 1 Facebook page.  Thanks very much-- Frank Palmieri, Unresolved,0
