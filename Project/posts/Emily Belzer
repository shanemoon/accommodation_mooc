Monday September 2nd 2013 11:04 pm -04:00,Its basically a way to override the primary interpretation of a character when it has multiple interpretations that it can use. So for instance characters like  have inherent value (starting and stopping strings) and when you want to use them inside a string the way to override that and use the so-to-speak second interpretation (as just a character in a string) is to put \ before it. Same thing with the newline character -- ns primary interpretation in a string is as a letter so to override that and tell the code to use its secondary interpretation (as a newline signifier) that requires a \ in front as well. Thats probably not the best explanation but maybe it helps and Im sure there are others on here who could give a more concise explanation., Resolved,2
Monday September 2nd 2013 10:39 pm -04:00,Hmm.  Id imagine you can use % in your return statement but maybe add parentheses if you havent tried that already.  However the first thing I thought of was a problem Ive had before where it looks like I have the right indentation but depending on the editor I used to write it I had a mix of tabs vs. spaces to indent different lines.  Particularly if youre using something other than IDLE Id check to make sure its all one or the other and youre probably best off for now going with spaces so you know exactly how many are there.  This could be a problem with whatever you originally used to look at the sample code.  Id give that a try at least., Unresolved,0
