Friday September 6th 2013 7:55 pm -04:00,Hi sorry - I read through all above but I still am not able to resolve my same problem. I am trying to define a function and I keep getting IndentationError. I have tried hitting return twice as someone else suggested but no luck. I even uninstalled and reinstalled python idle (windows) in case it was something I did earlier.I always get the error for example:>>> def square_return(num):... return num ** 2I THEN GET:   File <stdin> line 2      return num ** 2              ^IndentationError: expected an indented block.Could someone please explain step-by-step?There are my steps:1. WRITE def function(x):2. HIT RETURN3. WRITE return x ** 24. HIT RETURNand get errorthank you, Resolved,0

Still receive IndentationError.I am not sure if its called Terminal I have windows and downloaded the exact one the Professor pointed out in the first set of videos. It is a black screen - does not look like the ones shown in the lecture videos., Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 10:21 pm -04:00,Thank you - starting idle definitely works and its helpful as its color coded like the lecture videos. I would still like to use the Windows black-screen version thats downloaded without having to have to open idle. Just to clarify on the space thing do you mean:>>> def square_return(num):... return num ** 2 Hit space four timesOR do you mean physically hitting the space bar four times. i did try both but want to be sure Im writing exactly what you meant.Thank you again., Resolved,0
