Sunday August 25th 2013 7:56 pm -04:00,hello! whilst playing around on python i ran into a problem. i was trying to define the quadratic formula but could not get the function to return the + and - roots. heres the code maybe somebody could tell me what i did wrong? >>> def quad_formula (abc) :...    return (-b + ((b ** 2) - 4 * a * c) ** 1 / 2) / 2 * a...    return (-b - ((b ** 2) - 4 * a * c) ** 1 / 2) / 2 * ai believe that i might have gotten the code wrong by putting the two return statements but i honestly dont know. the code returns one value but not the two i want.  , Unresolved,0
