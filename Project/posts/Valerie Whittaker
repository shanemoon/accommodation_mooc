I also did not receive a point for it - in fact a portion of the point was taken away.Legal Python rules state that ....must contain only letters digits and _.The question also selected a name beginning with a digit: but the rules states....start with a letter or _.This I also received a deduction. ,None,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 8:26 am -04:00,If Adrians explanation is correct then the format to mark the tests is not clear. It takes another test to understand it. I took the test 2x over in order to see what went wrong and found 2 other answers which were contradictory. Thought of pulling out of the course if this is the way it will go but I do like a challenge so I forge on. From the results my final results for the assignment should be 14.75.,None,0
