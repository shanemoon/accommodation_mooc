Saturday September 14th 2013 12:01 pm -04:00,Im having issues with the Python visualizer (and it was working fine before). Any program that executes properly in Python does not run in the visualizer. I get a program terminated message after the first line executes everytime (for any program I try). Im using Ubuntu., Resolved,0

Tuesday September 17th 2013 6:08 pm -04:00,Daniel Ive been getting the same errors with my code which is similar. It looks like when  you return true or return false its not a Boolean statement which is what weve identified in the beginning of the function (str)->bool. SO IT WORKS GREAT IN PYTHON BUT NOT IN THE AUTOGRADER. Trouble is I cant figure out a way to write the code differently. Help please. anyone!!, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 6:20 pm -04:00,OK I found this in another thread. .....return True is Boolean but return true is not. My code finally worked in the autograder by using the Boolean version. I was banging my head against the wall on this. HOPE THIS HELPS!, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 1:04 pm -04:00,Hi chr should be char.You can substitute ATCG for valid. Skip the empty set. Also shift your final return True to the left so that you can finish looping through all the letters in your sequence., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 11:12 pm -04:00,You have to use if char in nucleotide: instead of == Hope that helps., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 11:37 pm -04:00,Yes you need to distinguish between nucleotide that you are counting and nucleotide count. You are returning a nucleotide count for your char in nucleotide., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 2:05 pm -04:00,I had the same problem. In my case I was calling the get complement function from the get-complementary _sequence function and I had some problems with get_complement which worked fine in Python but not in the autograder. The main thing was using == instead of is., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 11:44 am -04:00,Anyone know how to stop Python from running a program in the middle of running without losing everything? , Resolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 11:05 am -04:00,Tatiana you need to add a line from the examples within the given function at the end so the visualizer can run the code on the example otherwise it will get stuck on the first line., Resolved,0
