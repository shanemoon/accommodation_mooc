Saturday August 31st 2013 11:32 am -04:00,All:Please use Notepad++ for your editor. A large number of submissions are failing because IDLE doesnt indicate special character tabs. When entering the function body python thinks the argument is nested and causes assignment submissions to fail. Use Notepad++ to correct this and increase your success rate. See the examples listed below from my observation. I hope this helps anyone struggling with assignment submission.NESTED    :(PROPERLY TABBED   :), Resolved,0
