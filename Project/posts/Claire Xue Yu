Monday September 9th 2013 11:26 pm -04:00,If the game stores the values in XML then it may be using a database and query.But it may be easier to implement what you described with classes and objects i.e. construct the game character as a class with name speed and other characteristics as its attributes.You would write a constructor likeclass Character:    def __init__(self):        self.name =         self.hitpoints = 0 Then instantiate a character likex = Character()and assign its attributes x.name = Hero Dudex.hitpoints = 10Its possible to initialise attributes during instantiation. There may be errors in the code above but hopefully you get the idea. However I dont think classes and objects are in the syllabus of this course and Im not sure if we will see something else that does what you described by the end of this course.,None,2
