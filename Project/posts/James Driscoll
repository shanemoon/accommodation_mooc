Monday August 26th 2013 9:33 am -04:00,Does somebody really have to be awake and press a button? Itd be useful if things became available  at UTC+12  (and  deadlines where at  UTC-12). If this is not an automated process it should be computers are great at this sort of thing :-), Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 11:36 am -04:00,Thanks for the update Paul it would be useful user feedback if video lecture times where shown in localised time. In reality for the folk living in new zealand week 2 will be starting on the 27th. Some simple feedback to say the next thing you are waiting for (or deadline) will be available in the users local timezone would make organising time much simpler - particularly when users can be on several courses at all sorts of global locations at the same time.(I appreciate this is a coursera wide feature that needs fixing rather than a particular problem with this course). , Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 9:54 am -04:00,Hello anonymous I dont have a problem with the lecture becoming available at 5pm UK time - but itd be great if the user interface presented to me would say this (particularly as Ive set my local time to the UK) . Just displaying Week 1 is 19th August week 2 is 26th August etc is not enough information for all the people living east of that time zone to organise their time. If this is an automated process I also dont see a problem with setting start times to be UTC+12. (and deadlines to be UTC-12), Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 10:48 am -04:00,This is not a problem specific to this course - its a cousera wide problem. I appreciate I can do the maths butÂ  why should I have to remember each quirky sum for all the different courses Im doing from universities around the world when the user interface is more than capable of doing those sums for me? If you are finding the deadlines for submission are shown in my local time why cant you find the start time for a video lecture in your local time without having to do some mental arithmetic?, Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 9:28 am -04:00,I suspect a lot of us live in time zones east of Toronto. This course started on the 19th August  its now 14:21 on the 26th August (in the UK) but week 2 lectures have yet to appear.Is it possible to set your start times to be UTC+12 so the whole world can get to see the lectures on the date that is stated ?(perhaps for similar reasons you can argue that deadlines should be set to UTC-12 so nobody misses a deadline because they are west of a particular timezone).I appreciates I can set my local time zone in coursera but this has very little value unless all displayed dates are accompanied with a localised time., Unresolved,0
