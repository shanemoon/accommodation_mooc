Tuesday August 27th 2013 12:46 am -04:00,I definitely used an if/else in this solution in combination with an abs().  It achieves the desired results and passes all cases that I can test but Im not sure if this will be flagged as an incorrect solution by the grader/TAs/Instructors.  It did pass all of the automated grader steps though and I am receiving a perfect score.Its late here too and Ill look into another solution tomorrow using the to_24_hour_clock function.  Thanks for the tip., Resolved,0
