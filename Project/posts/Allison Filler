Monday August 26th 2013 11:26 pm -04:00,Here is a copy of the in-video quiz question: The correct answer is  the second choice Nothing.I know that a function exits as soon as a return statement is encountered. This is why hello does not print in the result. However could someone please clarify why 4 does not appear as the result?I think it has to do with putting result=sum(13) rather than just sum(13) in which case 4 is in fact returned but I dont understand what this distinction is.Any help would be appreciated thanks!, Resolved,0
