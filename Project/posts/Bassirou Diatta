Saturday September 14th 2013 9:01 pm -04:00,I tested your code and it works. Your problem was on the examples youre testingFor example here is your example insert_sequence(CCGG AT 2) it is wrong it should be in the form insert_sequence(CCGG  AT 2)they are commas between nucleotides and the index is just a number not a string. Try the corrected example and see, Resolved,0

Sunday September 29th 2013 9:29 am -04:00,Good job.I do not know why you keep getting a different number of characters in this file. The code is correct. I run a short file in my documents and I got exact the same number of characters., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 8:06 pm -04:00,Thank you sir or madamI have tried what you have suggested without success. I am trying to find out what part of the lecture week 6 can I use to solve my problem. As I said it before I have read many documents without finding the solution to my problem. I read the book recommended for the course but I did not find any help. I need to know so that I can starting working on my assignment. , Unresolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 8:08 pm -04:00,I want to write on a file in repeating the lecture note but I am getting stuck in this single problem , Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 9:59 pm -04:00,Thank your RichFollowing your suggestions and going back to the lecture notes I was able to work on the first part of the writing process. However when I called the contents it comes back empty . So I guess something is not working along the line because my file exists and has a content. When I pursuit the writing and got to >>> to_file = open(to_filename w)>>> to_file.write(Copy)I got an error saying it is unwriteable file. What I am doing wrong here?  , Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 9:04 am -04:00,Thank you sir/madamI was able to resolve the matter. I was making very simple mistakes such as after writing tkinter.filedialog.askopenfilename() i was not hitting ENTER. So I was adding the file name I wanted to open just after the ..... askopenfilename(). Thank you very much I really appreciate your help. , Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 12:47 am -04:00,Dear RosângelaI did not see any mistake in your code. What you need to do is go back to your file and check for the copy you have written. Your codes seem to follow exact the lecture notes., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 1:38 am -04:00,Dear Rosângelayou are right about the number for the number of characters in the contents. However the number 5 was about testing the code on the word Copy There are 5 characters in that word because you count C-o-p-y  and  as the fifth character. I have to run the file and see if I will get the same answer or not.to_file.write(Copy), Unresolved,0
