Thursday September 26th 2013 2:31 pm -04:00,Here is my code for num_words_on_board:counter = 0    for i in words:        if board_contains_word(boardi):            counter = counter + 1return counterin board_contains_word i wrote:return board_contains_word_in_column(board word) or board_contains_word_in_row(board word)And it works correctly. What is problem here? and why i am getting 2 instead of 3 again and again?, Resolved,-1
