Tuesday October 1st 2013 1:00 am -04:00,Hi Professors Jennifer and PaulMy name is Anderson Alexander Barbosa da Silva and I got the final and correct solution for the assignment 3 by Mon-30-Sep around 23:50h but when uploaded the data I sent by mistake an old version that was stored in my computer by 23:59:14.When I saw the error I read the entire program again and figured out that the correct file was saved in other location in my computer and sent it again by Tue  1 Oct 2013 12:24 AM EDT (UTC -0400).So as Im pursuing the maximum score in the course (it is the second time I do this course) Id like to ask you to consider this last submission (24 minutes after the final time submission without penalts) as it was submitted on time.I really want to have the maximum score so if you can consider that would be great.Thanks a lot., Unresolved,0
