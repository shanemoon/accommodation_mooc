Saturday September 7th 2013 10:55 am -04:00,I submit assignment 1 Im not happy with last step but apart that all other function work. I tested them and they work so why when I submitted them I getting error in step 5 get_hours get_minutes and get_seconds?, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 11:36 am -04:00,I tried your way and I fixed last step so now everything working perfectly but I still getting error in step 5 and last step. I think I will give up , Unresolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 3:53 pm -04:00,All possible errors in get_hours get_minutes get_seconds and in last step too. But it is calculating everything right just with larger amounts it isnt right. I tried precondition and hundreds combinations and I dunno what to do. e.g for 90000 seconds I should get 24 hours max but Im getting 25, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 4:04 pm -04:00,I wish to move on to week 3 but Id like to score more than 18. Seconds_difference is ok hours_difference is ok to_float_hours too then get_hours get_minutesget_seconds time_to_utc and time_from_utc mathematically is ok but doesnt work on larger amounts. to_24_hours_clock that what is messing with my assignment. Unfortunatly my blond head cant cope with it, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 6:24 pm -04:00,Thanks guysThere are my functionsget_hours>>>get_hours(3800)1>>>get_hours(7200)2 return seconds//3600>>>get_minutes(3800)3>>>get_minutes(5000)23return (seconds - 3600)//60>>>get seconds(3800)20>>>get_seconds(4000)40return seconds% 60, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 5:33 pm -04:00,So why when I try to submit Im not scoring at all for get_seconds if it is right?If to_24_hour_clock return number of hour as seen on a 24 hour clock and for get_hours I need two calculation first i need to call to_24_hour_clock so after my    Im typing return to_24_hour_clock then my function for return???second line - return my function??? It is that right?To_24_hour clock return num of hours funtion is hours % 24, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 6:13 pm -04:00,For >>>get_hours(452000)5That is a right answer but Im still not scoring for this and yourself said get_seconds it is right too but Im not scoring for that formula either.Get_hours..... After my    return to_24_hour_clock and rest of the formula. It is that right?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 1:19 pm -04:00,Im getting all possible failure in step 5 and in last step too. But I fixed my formula and it is working on 24 hour clock so I really dont know why they not scoring me for this two, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 11:12 am -04:00,Thanks it is very helpful, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 6:39 pm -04:00,thanks for help I fixed my formula thanks you guys. And I figure it out why then do not mark me for step 5 and last. I should more care what I submitting. Now I scored 38/41 so Im really happy about it :), Unresolved,1
Saturday September 21st 2013 5:44 pm -04:00,    def count_nucleotides(dna nucleotide):     (str str) -> int    Return the number of occurrences of nucleotide in the DNA sequence dna.    >>> count_nucleotides(ATCGGC G)    2    >>> count_nucleotides(ATCTA G)    0        num_nucleotide = 0    for nucleotide in dna:        if nucleotide in dna:            num_nucleotide = num_nucleotide + 1            return num_nucleotide   My logic is saying that how this code should looks like but it is wrong.

Saturday September 21st 2013 8:58 pm -04:00,I got it! Thanks. Now just need to fix mistakes in is_longer (2 FAILURES) is_valid (2 FAILURES) and contains_sequence(1 FAILURE), Resolved,0
