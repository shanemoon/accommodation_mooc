Monday September 2nd 2013 12:26 am -04:00,Some parts of the world are on Daylight Saving Time right now so you would need to account for that., Unresolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 1:35 am -04:00,HeyYoure correct. You should not need to set it to -3:00 to match Torontos current time. I have it set to -0:400 to account for DST and that gives me to current time in Toronto. Is your assignment currently saying 41/41 and not 42/41? If it is not saying 42 you have an error - look at the feedback. That could possibly account for the clock issues. Im just guessing though., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:35 am -04:00,Dianna let me try to be clearer. Due to DST you are technically in UTC - 7 which is an hour later. That is why changing to UTC - 8 is an hour earlier than your current local time. In England where the time zone is usally UTC 0 when they change to DST as they are now they move to UTC +1. So in that sense there is nothing wrong with the GUI nor your code. Go to this link that shows the current time in California and you will see that it says -7 because of Pacific Daylight Time.http://www.worldtimeserver.com/current_time_in_US-CA.aspx, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:37 am -04:00,This link actually writes out the offsets for you so you see your standard and your offset due to DST: http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=137Tuesday September 3 2013 at 12:36:19 AM PDTPop-up window | Full-screen window | Word Clock (as text)Free Los Angeles clock for your website Standard time zone:UTC/GMT -8 hoursDaylight saving time:+1 hourCurrent time zone offset:UTC/GMT -7 hoursTime zone abbreviation:PDT - Pacific Daylight Time, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:36 am -04:00,That makes sense since not everyone in UTC -8 is on DST. But Anthonys issue was slightly different. Even using UTC -4 which would account for DST in Toronto his clock was still off., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 1:33 am -04:00,Interesting. My local time (also UTC - 5 and currently on DST) and the time shown on the local clock is the same. So both are saying 1:30. And that was true for Anthony above too.  I didnt read through all the code since I dont understand all of it but it does seem to have lines relating to DST., Unresolved,0

Sunday September 15th 2013 7:46 pm -04:00,Hard to tell without looking at your code. But double check that you are using the right thing as string and the right thing as the substring., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 8:36 pm -04:00,Theres no need to accumulate for this question. Paula it needs to count only one letter at a time. So within ATCG you would ask it to look for A only. What you have above is asking it to count ATCG in whatever DNA is.DNA is the string.The nucleotide (individual letters) is the substring. , Unresolved,2

Sunday September 15th 2013 12:37 am -04:00,Hi RanjaniIf Tom Enos clear example isnt shedding light on the problem look back on the in-lecture quiz for str Methods: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/programming1/quizzes%2Fweek4%2F3_-_str_Methods_Functions_Inside_of_Objects_%28341%29-Quiz-1.pdfGo to page 4. Read the question and the answer and see if that helps. That quiz question gives exactly what is needed for this.Hope that helps., Unresolved,1
Sunday September 15th 2013 2:02 am -04:00,Look at this from the in lecture quiz.white_queen = Jam tomorrow and jam yesterday - but never jam today.Using count with one argument write an expression that produces the number of occurrences of jam in the string that white_queen refers to.The answer was white_queen.count(jam)You are going to do the same thing for this question and using only one line too.Count the number of times the nucleotide occurs in the DNA sequence.Does that help?, Unresolved,3
Sunday September 15th 2013 10:03 pm -04:00,Thats correct. The name function has to be different from the string you want to count inside of., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 10:30 pm -04:00,Since your code isnt working it is OK to post it so that we can talk about it. It will be a lot easier for me to guide you through whats wrong. From this I can tell that the program has no idea what count_nucl is because you didnt tell it. Do you want to post your code? Or do you want me to keep posting generalities? , Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 10:34 pm -04:00,Lets take it step by step.white_queen is my string.white_queen = Jam tomorrow and jam yesterday - but never jam today.I want to count sunstrings in my string. I could count all the as or I could count jam like we did before. Lets go with jam firstwe would type string.count(substring)white_queen.count(jam)If I wanted to count the letter a it would bewhite_queen.count(a)Now its the same thing for this assignment. You want to count the occurrence of each individual nucleotide (substring) in a given DNA (string)string.count(substring)Whatever you write must adhere to that formula.Youre going to give your string a general name and also your substring and those names are going to be in your function parameter. You could even stick with string and substring but the words string and substring have to appear in your function parameters., Unresolved,1
Sunday September 15th 2013 10:36 pm -04:00,OK Great. You are almost there!Like I said before the formula has to be string.count(substring)You are using using your function name instead of the string name., Unresolved,1
Sunday September 15th 2013 10:39 pm -04:00,Hint: ATCGGC is the string and  G is the substring. What general name did you give to each? Plug those names into the formula and youre done., Unresolved,2

Sunday September 15th 2013 7:59 pm -04:00,Look at the lecture for loop over str and pay attention to accumulators. You want to accumulate all the letters to get the rest., Resolved,1

Sunday September 15th 2013 2:55 am -04:00,You could skip the if statements and go straight to adding dna1_1 + dna2 etc. Of course youd write out what each is. Do it in the one line (define and add) or keep as you have it where you define first then add. , Unresolved,0

Monday September 16th 2013 6:49 pm -04:00,dna1 > dna2  doesnt test whether dna1 is longer than dna2. You have to include something that tells the program to compare the lengths of each., Resolved,0
