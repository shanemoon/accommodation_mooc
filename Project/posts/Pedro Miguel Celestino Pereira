Wednesday September 18th 2013 7:33 pm -04:00,HiI am having a few problems on the assignment and this one in particular it looks like it should be fine and in the python visualizer it also seems fine but for some reason I always get 0 nucleotides as if it just doent add.def count_nucleotides(dna nucleotide):        num_nucleotide = 0    for char in dna:        if nucleotide in dna:            num_nucleotide = num_nucleotide + 1    return num_nucleotideBut this is what I get.    >>> count_nucleotides(ATCGGC G)    0http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=def+count_nucleotides(dna+nucleotide)%3A%0A++++%0A++++nu...Anyone can tell me what is wrong?Thanks., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 8:02 pm -04:00,Thanks. I did the str because it was giving me 6 before (and before I re tried it on the visualiser I though it as something even more wrong by some reason).Anyway I replaced dna by char and it works now., Resolved,0

Thursday September 19th 2013 10:22 pm -04:00,Hi so I got everything else working but this one and I can get it to return False  but it wont return the True (it returns None)def is_valid_sequence(seq):    new_seq = -    for char in seq:        if char not in ATCG:            new_seq = new_seq + char            for letter in new_seq:                if char in ATCG:                    return True                else:                    return Falsehttp://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=def+is_valid_sequence(seq)%3A%0A++++new_seq+%3D+%22-%22%0A++++for+char+in+seq%3A%0A++++++++if+char+not+in+%22ATCG%22%3A%0A++++++++++++new_seq+%3D+new_seq+%2B+char%0A++++++++++++for+letter+in+new_seq%3A%0A++++++++++++++++if+char+in+%22ATCG%22%3A%0A++++++++++++++++++++return+True%0A++++++++++++++++else%3A%0A++++++++++++++++++++return+False%0A++++++++++++%0A++++++++++++%0Ais_valid_sequence(%22ATGGC%22)&mode=display&cumulative=false&heapPrimitives=true&drawParentPointers=true&textReferences=true&showOnlyOutputs=false&py=3&curInstr=14Any idea of what I am doing wrong?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 11:43 pm -04:00,Thanks I got it so simple I actually did something quite similar before but the else was not at the right indentation level.Still out of curiosity if anyone could tell me what is not working in the code above it would be nice I even tried different indentation for else (what a irony)., Resolved,0
