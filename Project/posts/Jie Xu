Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:13 pm -04:00,If programming language has this kind of problem why softwares such as Excel can give an exact number of 6.76? (or at least it appears as it is like that) By exact I mean when you use the button to get more decimal you get only 6.76000000000000000000 but not 6.760000000000001?, Resolved,0
