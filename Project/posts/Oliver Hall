Thursday September 5th 2013 3:02 pm -04:00,Im not convinced that theres an issue with clarity or ambiguity here. I can see however that the question requires perhaps more careful thought than some of the others and that getting used to the type of question could have a part to play.Hopefully discussions in these forums will help those having trouble to get a better feel for how to approach these problems., Unresolved,1

Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:16 pm -04:00,Hi fellow coders!Im having difficulty with interpreting the failure messages being returned on my get_complement and get_complementary_sequence functions. Ive tested a multitude of parameters and all seem to yield the expected results.  Perhaps another set of eyes could spot the problem?Ive looked through the other threads in case to try and avoid duplication but cant see that anyone has encountered exactly the same problem (yet).1)def get_complement(nucleotide):    if  nucleotide == A:                    return C    elif nucleotide == T:                    return G       elif nucleotide == C:                    return A        elif nucleotide == G:                    return TThe failure message is as follows (I have tested all 4 nucleotides):Method Description:Have you tested your function with all 4 nucleotides?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorC != T- C+ T : Have you tested your function with all 4 nucleotides?2)def get_complementary_sequence(dna):    complementary_seq =         for nuc in dna:        complementary_seq = complementary_seq + get_complement(nuc)    return complementary_seqFailure messages (Where each asks if Ive tried/tested something my answer is yes):Method Description:Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorCG != TA- CG+ TA : Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?Method Description:Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences        of each nucleotide?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorCGATCGAT != TAGCTAGC- CGATCGAT+ TAGCTAGC : Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences            of each nucleotide?, Resolved,0

Tuesday September 24th 2013 1:56 pm -04:00,Hi allIn the read_grades() function Paul includes the following code to skip the header and get to the grade info we want to append to the grades list:# skip over the header.line = gradefile.readline()while line != :    line = gradefile.readline()While I understand that this code asks that blank lines be ignored I dont understand how this ignores the header lines that begin with an asterisk (as below from a1_test.txt) .* a1 gradesfile* id  gradeCould someone explain? Is it that line beginning with an asterisk are ignored by the .readline() method by default?Many thanks in advance!, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 2:21 pm -04:00,Thanks I see what you mean.  Its not ignoring blank lines its ignoring everything until it reaches a blank line and then takes notice of what to do next.Correct?, Resolved,2
Thursday September 26th 2013 3:56 am -04:00,I cant quite see where Im going wrong here:My function is failing with the following:Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Board not loaded correctly. Did you get rows and columns mixed up?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Non-square board not loaded correctly.Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Board not loaded correctly.Message:FAILURE: AssertionError<class str> != <class list> : Expected a <code>list</code> of <code>list</code> of <code>str</code>s to be returned.Now. For the supplied board file my function is returning teh following which looks okay to me:>>> read_board(board_file)[EFJAJCOWSS SDGKSRFDFF ASRJDUSKLK HEANDNDJWA ANSDNCNEOP PMSNFHHEJE JEPQLYNXDL]In an attempt to address the Non-square board... failure I created another row in the file:EFJAJCOWSSJEPQSDGKSRFDFFASRJDUSKLKHEANDNDJWAANSDNCNEOPPMSNFHHEJEJEPQLYNXDLMy function still seems okay:>>> read_board(board_file)[EFJAJCOWSS JEPQ SDGKSRFDFF ASRJDUSKLK HEANDNDJWA ANSDNCNEOP PMSNFHHEJE JEPQLYNXDL]Any pointers/clues/thoughts guys?Many thanks in advance., Resolved,1

Thursday September 26th 2013 7:24 am -04:00,Yes - how stupid of me. I still wasnt really considering the contents of the file as a grid/board.I still cant see how my code wouldnt be able to handle case where no rows != no of columns but Im guessing that in the correct cod eyou have to make some sort of provision for this., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 7:34 am -04:00,So at the moment Im reading each line as a string into a list using the append function.Im struggling to work out how to read each character of a line into say board[i][j].  Im guessing that a new line or  could be used as the break between the sub-lists but not sure how toa) implement this andb) run it over x number of rows.  - Maybe use a count of how many  there exists in the whole file?  doesnt actually exist as a character in the file so how would I count this... read the whole lot into a string first then count s? Then loop over Sorry for the stream of conciousness!, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 7:51 am -04:00,So I guess what we want to acheive is a list = [[lst[i][j] lst[i][j + 1] lst[i][j + 2]... ] [lst[i + 1][j] lst[i + 1][j + 1] lst[i + 1][j + 2]... ]....] [lst[i + 2][j] lst[i + 1][j + 1] lst[i + 2][j + 2]... ]....]i looping over rows and j looping over characters in each row...Am I on the right lines?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 9:02 am -04:00,Were all 4 approaches successful Rocio or just the nested loop?It seems to me that it would be as follows:MainLoop - read i line as string    NestedLoop - read j character from string into list at index [i][j]?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 9:57 am -04:00,I feel the same way about ranges. Realised that the main loop can be a while loop that works until no further rows are available in the file but I cant work out how you would move to each new sublist without a range that works against the length of the row (unless its while i != ?!).I do feel a lot closer now though. Thanks for the ideas., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 9:05 am -04:00,Thanks Anon good suggestion. I think a spot of inpatience is clouding my judgement on this.Rocios comment above is also helpful leading me to consider the following nested loop approach:MainLoop - read i line as string    NestedLoop - read j character from string into list (at index [i][j]) ## - this part being what you suggested I look at first, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 9:13 am -04:00,Cheers will do., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 9:45 am -04:00,Im not going to be able to test this till tonight but I think Im closer now.board_read is declared as an empty list.i is initialised to 0 upfront.Main loop needs to be a while loop - running only while !=    Main loop then reads 1st row of file into variable line.    Variable line_str then gets assigned the value of line turned into a string with the  stripped away.        Sub loop runs with j in range determined by length of line_str.            List board_read is appended with value line_str[i][j].        i is manually increased by 1File is closed.List board_read is returned            I hope Im close! I might submit it out of curiosity until I get the chance to test it tonght., Resolved,0

Thursday September 26th 2013 10:48 am -04:00,i denotes the row number and consequently describes which sublist character j is appended to.I think!  Will have to test it to see if it works., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 12:15 pm -04:00,Hi AnonIve defined board_read as a list at the beginning of the function so wouldnt board_read.append(line_str[j]) not append the board_read list with an item = character at index j of line_str?Hi Morlaye.Solution sounds good - I might need to give that more thought.So are you saying that when you read a line you immediately create a list from it (using a loop over the length of the line) then append it to board_list?  Then do the same straight after reading the next line?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 12:34 pm -04:00,Okay. So my main loop is incrementing variable i which which I hope to denote the index of the sublist then j is being incremented over the length of the row and inserting it at index j of the sublistI think I see what you mean though...  board_read[i].append(line_str[j]) isnt syntactically correct?Im seeing mor what Morlaye describes now however I cant see how it can be done without a while loop to move through each line and stop at the end and a for loop to create each sublist then add it to the mainlist for each line., Resolved,0
