Sunday August 25th 2013 5:33 pm -04:00,I have a similar problem. After I define a function in a new window and save and run it I only get a new prompt. Any ideas?, Resolved,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 5:44 pm -04:00,Wow youre really on top of this forum. Thank you very much for the quick reply. However I just realized that it was instead an error between the chair and the keyboard that was causing the mistake. I did not include the result statement in the indented line when defining it. I was wondering why my other functions would call but that one wouldnt.Â Thanks again, Resolved,0
