Monday September 2nd 2013 8:00 am -04:00,Lol - if its my comment you find a little crude - I apologise. Im from England the use of the term beginning with b is quite common and considered harmless over here (and considering the bad language that come out of the mouths of other people of my generation - I thought it was completely in-offensive). However if its use startled you - I sincerely apologise once again. On the plus side - I finally cracked Q15. Yay me! , Unresolved,1

Monday September 23rd 2013 8:38 am -04:00,HiI was submitting my assignment 2 and I accidentally submitted it in Assignment 1. Will this affect my assignment 1 score? I had completed Assignment 1 on time - got full marks but it mentions on the assignment submission page that any assignments submitted any time after the hard deadline you will not receive credit. Have I effectively just cancelled out my score for assignment 1 by mistakenly submitting assignment 2 in the wrong place? I resubmitted assignment 1 in the correct Assignment 1 place - after assignment 2 in the incorrect place - just to make sure nothing was erased. If you look at my record under the view/feedback it will show that I submitted it before the deadline. Could you please let me know. SarbIm based in the UK but on holiday in Toronto (hence last minute submission of Assignment 2) - so the times might appear in GMT or local Toronto im not sure.Proof I submitted on time raw score 41:41error made today shows raw score 0:41: error corrected to show raw score 41:41 , Unresolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 9:47 am -04:00,Yes - I hope so. It all depends on when the grades are all collected in and how it is done. If the computerised system collects all the results at the completion of the course and takes the last score - then I am in trouble if it ignores all previous scores before the cut off date. If it takes the last score before the last cut off date - im ok. I would just like some clarification. It would be really annoying to lose the score. Sarb , Unresolved,0
