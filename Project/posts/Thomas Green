Monday September 2nd 2013 6:42 am -04:00,I dont understand why my feedback includes 13 failures when I tested the codes in IDLE and they all returned the expected/desired results.  What am I missing?  For example one of my results:student: test_get_hours.TestGetHours.test_example_from_handoutMethod Description:Test the example in the handout.Message:FAILURE: AssertionError1 != 8jaco4ever@yahoo.com, Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 7:16 am -04:00,I used the exact examples that were included in the code that was given to me.  I just looked at section 5 in the handout and I dont know what examples are being referenced.  Are you telling me that because I tested a different example my code failed?, Unresolved,0
