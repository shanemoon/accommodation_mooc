Monday September 23rd 2013 11:40 am -04:00,I have a problem with the two following tests:test_a2.TestIsValidSequence.test_is_valid_sequence_invalid_capital_letterandtest_a2.TestIsValidSequence.test_is_valid_sequence_lowercaseI made two different codes and in IDLE they give me the correct answers(if I test them myself) but the tests on the website give a failure. Here are my codes: ans=True    B=get_length(dna)    S=0    for char in dna:        if char in ATCG:         S=S+1    if S < B:         ans=False    return ans  ans=True    for char in dna:        if char in BDEFHIJKLMNOPQRSUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz:            ans=False    return ansIs there someone who can help me? 24/24 is always better then 22/24. , Resolved,0
