Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:24 am -04:00,HiI solved this with a simply calling :return len(word)This was however marked wrong.The question is being over complicated in my opinion. Any pointers out there??TnxG, Unresolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:59 am -04:00,JonnyYour right.I got it... :)Actually rather simple.How do I explain this to you William????The question stated there are two functions count_vowels & count_consonants right. Each of these has the same parameter i.e. (word).We need to assume that for this example count_vowels and count_consonants already did the hard work and counted the seperate vowels and consonants.No you simply need to return this by adding these two functions together and and remenber to write this in the correct format like a function looks count_letters(word)I am not teacher so dont shoot me for the bad explenation.Hope it helps.:)G, Unresolved,17

Monday September 2nd 2013 3:26 pm -04:00,HiQuestion 8 states the following:The math module has a function that finds the ceiling of a number (the smallest integral value greater or equal to the number). Assuming that the math module has already been imported write an expression that calls the ceiling function from math to find the ceiling of 84.2.Hint: In IDLE import math and then use dir and help on the math module to determine the name of the function that you need to use.Having executed the code using Python 3.3.2 it gave me an answer that I inserted into the exercise but was marked wrong.I believe there is an error in the marking.Please check and advise.RegardsG, Resolved,0
