Friday September 13th 2013 4:43 am -04:00,Hi all Ive completed Competitive Strategy course and while waiting for grading process to end wrote a small programm just to make sure I can handle it and that Ive gained some expirience. It was pretty hard (and I googled one solution) - but still can it be done better?PreambleYour final score (0-100 points) will be calculated as follows:40% from the final7-exam quiz20% from the end of week quiz with the highest score20% from the end of week quiz with the second highest score20% from the end of week quiz with the third highest scorePlease note that the case studies are not graded and are not relevant for your final score. If you fail to pass a quiz or completed it after hard deadline - you fail the course.Weekly quizes have a base of ten final quiz has a base of 25. My own resuts are floats (9.75 - 10 - 9.25 - 10 - 9.75 - 7.67 - 19.29)My idea was to make a closed code (better to make it executable on its own but I dont know how to do it). All comments are accepted - and YES I know that Ive failed the design recepie.import heapqdef check_results(week1 week2 week3 week4 week5 week6 final):    if week1 == 0 or week2 == 0 or week3 == 0 or week4 == 0 or week5 == 0 or week6 == 0:        print (You failed to submit quiz on time and failed to pass the course)    else:        heap = [week1 week2 week3 week4 week5 week6]        result = ((sum(heapq.nlargest(3 heap)) / 30) * 60) + final / 25 * 40        if result < 50:            print(You passed the course your result is  (result))        if result > 50:            print(Your passed the course with distinction your result is  (result))                def grades_input():    week1 = float(input(What is your Week 1 grage? ))    week2 = float(input(What is your Week 2 grage? ))    week3 = float(input(What is your Week 3 grage? ))    week4 = float(input(What is your Week 4 grage? ))    week5 = float(input(What is your Week 5 grage? ))    week6 = float(input(What is your Week 6 grage? ))    final = float(input(What is your final exam grage? ))    check_results(week1 week2 week3 week4 week5 week6 final)So the user just has to write grades_input()Suggestions / ideas?,None,0
