Wednesday August 28th 2013 5:59 am -04:00,I think some of the problems stem from over analyzing the instructions. Like Rob mentioned about the clock. In the description of get_hours it mentions to call to_24_hour_clock because looking for the hour on a 24 hour clock. in the descriptions of get_hours and get_minutes it doesnt specify the 24 hour clock because youre no longer looking for hours therefore theres no need to adjust to a 24 hour clock but instead your need to adjust to the 60 minutes in an hour or the 60 seconds in a minute. I dont think theyre trying to throw any curve-balls at us just yet but they may later on to ensure we understand the subject matter. If you think youve got it test it and if youre right youve got it. That or maybe Im just over analyzing things., Unresolved,5
