Thursday September 5th 2013 6:54 am -04:00,This question was confusing me as well. If you look at the question: Which English sentence is true exactly when the Boolean expression evaluates to True? its the true exactly part that is important. Because of the Bool or either math_grade bio_grade or cs_grade have to be >= 50 in order to return True. In other words it says we get a True value from the Boolean expression when the student at least passed one of the courses. Option a is saying: student passed 0 out of 3 courses (False)Option b is saying: student passed >=1 out of 3 courses (True)Option c is saying: student passed 3 out of 3 courses (True)Option d is saying: student passed >=1 and <3 out of 3 courses (True)Option b exactly applies the condition when we get a True because it is saying what the Boolean expression states: the student passed at least one of the courses.(pardon my basic English :$), Unresolved,3
Friday September 13th 2013 8:02 am -04:00,Hi AntonFirst off this is a really nice idea to program with Python. I was wondering if the program will work if you just write grades_input()? And what will happen if the result is 50? Also I noticed that if you call the check_results function via grades_input there is no return value from check_results to grades_input. It might be best to do so to save some memory space.A small esthetic comment on check_results: there are a lot of arguments for the function! Perhaps you can reduce it to 2 arguments so 1 argument for a list with quiz grades and 1 argument for the final grade.I was getting a bit excited and inspired from analyzing your coding so I decided to challenge myself and try to implement these suggestions in your code. ( I didnt use the heapq module as it made me a little bit confused so took a different -cumbersome- approach)def check_results(result final):    for x in range(0 len(result)):        if float(result[x]) == 0.0:            return You failed to submit quiz on time and failed to pass the course    sres = sorted(result)    three_high = int(sres[len(sres)-3])+int(sres[len(sres)-2])+int(sres[len(sres)-1])    test_result = ((three_high / 30) * 60) + ((int(final) / 25) * 40)        if test_result > 50:        return You passed the course with distinction your result is  test_result    else:         return You passed the course your result is  test_result        week1 = input(What is your Week 1 grade? )week2 = input(What is your Week 2 grade? )week3 = input(What is your Week 3 grade? )week4 = input(What is your Week 4 grade? )week5 = input(What is your Week 5 grade? )week6 = input(What is your Week 6 grade? )final = input(What is your final exam grade? )total_result = (week1 week2 week3 week4 week5 week6)result = check_results(total_result final)print(result)The check_results function now has 2 parameters and a return call.I dont have a lot of experience in programming so bare in mind this is only my beginners point of view. : ) ,None,0
Friday September 13th 2013 11:42 am -04:00,This option basically says: if True it means the student has passed all tests so has scored a minimum of >= 50. So if math_grade bio_grade and cs_grade are all lets say  60 you get True. Of course a True value is also returned if one of the grades is >= 80 and the rest is >=50. But you want to be more explicit saying a True value is returned only whenever the student has passed all tests and got at least one A. Therefore you have to make a Boolean expression that checks if grades are >=50 and at least one of the grades is >= 80., Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 5:26 am -04:00,Nikos it might be possible the variable new_message is not empty (new_message = ) but it is already containing the string value Happy 30th!. So when you run the script it says happy 30th! happy 30th!. The first happy 30th is from the old string value and the second happy 30th is the created string value. If you now run the script again it would return happy 30th! happy 30th! happy 30th!., Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 5:00 am -04:00,This may sound silly but I actually dont mind Jen and Paul make these typing errors. It creates a nice moment for us viewers to take a breath and digest what has just been said while they are correcting their typing. In the video lecture on Read files it appears Paul speeded up the video so all the typing was presented on the screen at an incredible fast rate. I had to watch that video multiple times because it was going so fast!,None,1

Saturday September 28th 2013 11:53 am -04:00,Have you checked whether the words in every column return True? It happened to me that I accidentally did not process the words in the last two columns., Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 11:42 am -04:00,Hi Ana Yes it appears you havent defined word_list. You need to open a word list file (for example the wordlist1.txt file) first. Store the location in a variable word_list and try if the command line read_words(word_list) will work.I also needed to rewatch how to open a file first :$ You can also look at the bottom of the a3_driver.py to see how they opened the files., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 12:04 pm -04:00,Hi everyoneThe help command is a great relief to figure out how to use a certain module or function.

Sunday September 29th 2013 4:35 am -04:00,Hi AnonymousThe read_board function you mentioned basically needs to translate a board file (like board1.txt) into a list of list of str.

Friday October 4th 2013 11:15 am -04:00,Hi HildaIve tested you code and I also receive  at times I do not select a file. When creating the variable from_filename you directly need to select a file. Otherwise it will get . Perhaps this is also the case in your situation? , Unresolved,0

Saturday October 5th 2013 7:18 am -04:00,Hi HildaI have tested your code. It works great for *.txt files but not for *.doc or *.docx files. After googling a little bit it seems that you need to take a different approach to read a doc file in Python other than using the standard command lines read and open. There is a Python module that enables you to open read and write doc(x) files (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docx). I am still very new to using and installing modules so I cant really help you on this yet. :( , Unresolved,0

Friday October 4th 2013 11:09 am -04:00,Hm OK. What happens if you manually read the lines of the file one at the time. Do you eventually end up at a single string  ?, Resolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 12:32 pm -04:00,Nothing wrong there. The code somehow does not recognize the empty string and is looping over and over again. Perhaps the  is deleted somewhere in the process of stripping ? How do you print the line in your read_words function? And how do you move on to the next line? Did you also check if there is no space between the  in the while-statement? (so  instead of  ) Just shooting in the dark here :) , Resolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 7:39 am -04:00,Hi Niranjan Maybe you could try if it works when you add an extra tab before else.for row_index in range(len(board)):        c = make_str_from_row(board row_index)        for word in c:            if word in c:               return True            else:               return FalseI hope this helps.Oh..also realized that you might change the for word in c line. For word in c already implies that word is in c so this is always true., Unresolved,0
