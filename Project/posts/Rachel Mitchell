Saturday August 31st 2013 3:09 pm -04:00,I have the same problem going on. The code gave me the correct answer for the examples but it was marked wrong. I did call to_24_hour_clock. help?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 4:44 pm -04:00,I have the body written for the is_valid_sequence code and correctly returns True or False with all characters except if a lower case letter is used it still returns True.  Im stuck. I thought that Python recognizes upper case characters and lower case characters as different but for me it is equating upper case to lower case letters. Does this make sense? Please help if you can., Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 11:11 pm -04:00,Thanks for your reply Henry!I tried the tests for equality that you suggested and they do both produce False. However still when I test my code using a lower case letter it returns True. Should I post my code? I dont want to break the rules but I suppose something is wrong with it. Moderators let me know if I need to take this down:for char in dna:        if char not in ACGT:            return False        else:            return True, Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 12:21 am -04:00,Gessell I am on the same page as you. I have been working on this damn thing for hours and cannot figure out what I need to do. So far hints are not helping me either., Unresolved,4
Saturday September 14th 2013 1:27 am -04:00,Ok! I think Ive finally figured it out. I interpreted the assignment description as saying you will either use a Boolean variable method OR you will use the method we get from the For Loop Over Str lecture (setting a value equal to zero and adding onto it). I tried for hours only focusing on the boolean aspect- did not work. I do not know if that is even possible. For me I needed to use both. So try using the method in For Loop Over Str in addition to adding a boolean True or False return.Hope that helps anyone who is stuck in the place that I was. It sucks. But keep trying! And let me know if I can clarify anything., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 2:48 am -04:00,I already read the A2 FAQ. I did not include the print function only used return.Ive been working on it for awhile too and I have no idea how to make is_valid_sequence() return as True. This is the result I got when I submitted my assignment:student2417250Detailstudent: test_a2.TestInsertSequence.test_insert_sequence_at_beginningERRORstudent: test_a2.TestInsertSequence.test_insert_sequence_at_endERRORstudent: test_a2.TestInsertSequence.test_insert_sequence_example_from_handoutERRORstudent: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_handout_exampleERRORstudent: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_longERRORstudent: test_a2.TestGetComplement.test_get_complementFAILUREstudent: test_a2.TestIsValidSequence.test_is_valid_sequence_zero_lengthFAILURETotal2417250 Any help you can provide is appreciated., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 3:19 pm -04:00,Thank-you all for replying! I didnt realize that clicking on the blue ERROR would give more info and that was especially helpful. Ive fixed some problems but I am still having problems in the following areas:student: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementaMethod Description:Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?Message:ERROR: TypeErrorCant convert NoneType object to str implicitlyI have tested the example in the handout and I get the correct return see:>>> get_complementary_sequence(AT)TAstudent: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_longMethod Description:Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences        of each nucleotide?Message:ERROR: TypeErrorCant convert NoneType object to str implicitlyI have tested my function on a sequence with multiple occurrences and it returns correctly:>>> get_complementary_sequence(TTTAAAGGGCCCT)AAATTTCCCGGGAstudent: test_a2.TestGetComplement.test_get_complementMethod Description:Have you tested your function with all 4 nucleotides?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorNone != T : Have you tested your function with all 4 nucleotides?I have tested all 4 nucleotides and returns correctly:>>> get_complement(A)T>>> get_complement(T)A>>> get_complement(C)G>>> get_complement(G)CThe final problem Im having with the assignment is true but I have no idea how to fix it.student: test_a2.TestIsValidSequence.test_is_valid_sequence_zero_lengthMethod Description:Have you tested your function with a zero-length sequence?  (It should be valid.)Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorNone is not true : Have you tested your function with a zero-length sequence?  (It should be valid.)My zero-length sequence in the validity test does not return anything. Can anyone point me in the right direction here? Ive tried explicitly telling the program that when there is a zero-length sequence to return as True but then when I test it on Idle it doesnt return anything.Thank-you!, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 3:49 pm -04:00,Im not sure if I understand exactly what youre asking. But here is what my code is when I use the == and =. I do not use is in my code.nucleotide=nucleotide+1            if len(dna)==nucleotide:, Unresolved,-1
Saturday September 14th 2013 4:32 pm -04:00,I know the zero-length test should return True. My problem is that I do not know how to achieve this., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 4:52 pm -04:00,Hallelujah! I finally got it to return true. Apparently I had the right code segment it was just in the wrong place. , Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 10:17 pm -04:00,Luca I am getting the same responses on the get complement and get complementary sequence tests. Yet my code works. Ive also read A2 FAQ. And Ive submitted the right file. Still dont know whats wrong :(, Unresolved,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 11:40 pm -04:00,Ive been working on this for about 3 hours now. Ive looked at other forums but I think Im getting more and more confused.Here is my (obviously incorrect) code:    newList=        for line in words_file.readline():        newList=newList+newList.append(words_file.rstrip(/n))    return newListI dont know if Im doing anything right at this point.Please help! Please point me in the right direction! My brain is about to explode., Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 12:17 am -04:00,Thank-you for taking pity on me Tom!I must have misunderstood you because my code is still not returning the correct answer.

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 1:05 am -04:00,I think I need to do that drilling. I feel like I dont do enough practice here and so when the assignments come I dont know what to do with myself. Thanks for posting that link!In other news I think I have pretty good code for read_board except that it returns with an empty string. This is what it returns:[[E F J A J C O W S S ] [S D G K S R F D F F ] [A S R J D U S K L K ] [H E A N D N D J W A ] [A N S D N C N E O P ] [P M S N F H H E J E ] [J E P Q L Y N X D L ]]Ive been looking through the forums and I dont see that anyone else has had this problem. Any idea of what is wrong here?, Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 1:18 am -04:00,I just found another forum where you give some advice so that is great. But Im having trouble applying the advice methinks.so my method is as follows:outer list     loop         list in a list            while statement                append inner list            append outer list   return outer listFrom what I understood you suggested that there is a while statement before appending the inner list. Something I am doing with the while statement isnt right though because it then my function doesnt return anything.Any thoughts? Should I be more blunt with any parts of code?, Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 1:45 am -04:00,Tom! Are you an angel or something?  Problem solved and I can go to sleep now! I feel like you deserve a medal. The Nobel Peace Prize of the Python forums perhaps., Resolved,2
