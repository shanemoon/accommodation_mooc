Wednesday September 25th 2013 12:22 pm -04:00,Hi  Janusz!The first snippet of code produces a a1_filename which is of type str. You can check that yourself by running lines 1 -  3  in IDLE.Then use built-in function type() to find out what a1_filename is>>>  type(a1_filename)See what you get.Now type>>> type(a1_file)In the second snippet a1_filename is not actually a str  because the method askopenfile() opens the file for you. So your a1_filename is not a filename at all its an object representing a file. Check this by using type() function on it.Be careful not to let the names of the variables lead you to form invalid conclusions.This difference between methods askopenfile() and askopenfilename() was mentioned in the lecture., Unresolved,1
