Friday September 20th 2013 10:45 am -04:00,I have come up with several different ways to write these functions all of which work in the python shell with every example I can think of. However when I submit it for grading I am getting 3 failures 2 for get_complementary_sequence and one for get_complement.When I look at the detailed error message I get this which basically implies that my code is returning a blank string when they test it (which is not the case when I run it in the shell):FAILURE: AssertionError != TA+ TA : Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?Is anyone else having this problem?

Friday September 20th 2013 11:42 am -04:00,Yeah my get_complement function works and heres how Ive reference is in get_complementary_sequence:    dna_complement =     for char in dna:        dna_complement = dna_complement + get_complement(char)                return dna_complement          I have not used any print statements. As I said EVERYTHING IVE WRITTEN works when I run it in the shell (hence my frustration ^_^) Ill try it with print statements and see if that works., Unresolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 11:46 am -04:00,Ah I see. Welp in that case Im stumped again. Thanks though!, Unresolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 12:07 pm -04:00,TA>>>get_complementary_sequence(AACCTT)TTGGAAAnd so on and so forth.Again everything Ive tried works when I test it in the shell. I dont know why the tester is getting empty strings. , Unresolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 12:13 pm -04:00,Oh and I forgot to answer your other question the other two errors Im getting are essentially exactly the same. It says my functions are returning blank strings. This is not the case when I test them myself. When I test them myself everything works exactly as it should., Unresolved,0
