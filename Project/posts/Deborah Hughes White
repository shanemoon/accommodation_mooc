Saturday September 7th 2013 5:53 pm -04:00,I agree I am not understanding the discussions about stacks and frames but can do all the programming correctly. I got everything but 14-16 correct read through the discussion here FORTUNATELY wrote down my previous answers enough so that I didnt have to work through every exercise again and then got a 16 out of 16 (I did/saved the exercises throughout a long work week). I hope the instructors are seeing how many people get the last questions wrong the first time they do this exercise and either teach it again because its important and has practical applications or drop it because its only a pedagogic resource. Except for this subject I am enjoying the class., Resolved,1
Saturday September 28th 2013 11:01 am -04:00,i had trouble a few weeks ago trying to make the debugger control work on my PC. I have tried again this morning. I got it to step through once as I tried to follow the lecture but when it got to the end all the controls greyed out. I reran the module and tried again but cant get it to work. The Help screen indicates this function as [toggle] but I dont know the keystroke combination to toggle (or whether that is my issue). I am on Idle/Python 3.3.2. In general I have found it confusing to see the lecture on a MAC and try to understand what that looks like on my PC. Unfortunately I have a very intense job workload right now so I dont have a lot of time to play with the Python/Idle program., Unresolved,0
