Thursday September 26th 2013 5:57 am -04:00,I think it always refers to: - if english is a list each item in that list - if we were talking about a string each character of that string - if it was a file each line of that file Its always the same idea (and you can say banana instead of mark char or line.... you name it)Sorry perhaps Im not good explain things., Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 10:47 am -04:00,def write_to_file(file sentences):     (file open for writing list of str) -> NoneType    Write each sentence from sentences to file one per line.    Precondition: the sentences contain no newlines.        # CODE MISSING HERESorry but Im not sure if I understand what this function is supposed to do. Is sentence the same as line? What is the meaning here for newlines? It would really helpful for me if someone write a little example please..., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 11:15 am -04:00,The same happened to me. Perhaps it is because you havent closed the flies., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 11:17 am -04:00,But I still dont understand what this is going to do. Is it a copy function??, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 2:11 am -04:00,Thank you for your help !! I didnt notice sentences was a list of str !! Clumsy of me!!, Resolved,1
Thursday September 26th 2013 5:23 am -04:00,I think this is the return expected Oliver but it works with same-lenght rows., Resolved,1
Thursday September 26th 2013 8:09 am -04:00,Ive done at least 4 distinct aproaches trying to solve this problem and nested loops are my solution., Resolved,2
Thursday September 26th 2013 9:30 am -04:00,Only one of my aproaches were succesful but all of them include one or another nested loops. Im not using double index that way. From the beginning i was obsesed with range use and finnally I found the way but i suppose you can get it by this way too Im not sure., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 8:19 am -04:00,Your return variable is a string and should be a list of string., Unresolved,1
Thursday September 26th 2013 9:35 am -04:00,Sorry youre absolutely right list of list of str for the second function.Thanks!, Unresolved,1
