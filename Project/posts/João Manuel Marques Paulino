Wednesday September 11th 2013 8:19 pm -04:00,You just picked up the wrong way to solve that problem.. It has such a simple solution!Like Tom said:you are over thinking this.the function isÂ is_valid_sequenceif it is a valid sequence return Trueif it is NOT a valid sequence return FalseTheres no need to create bool variables ;), Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 8:34 pm -04:00,I used boolean logic and I didnt need to create a variable thats all Im saying ;)Its simple instead of a variable you just return true or false.. I didnt say it was wrong.But if you do want to use one the question is correct.. In the question it doesnt say that the variable should be called non-nucleotide found.. You name it what you want ;) Since you want it to return False when you find a non-nucleotide you should turn the flag to false when you find one. You can name it not_found that way it makes more sense now to be initialised to True., Resolved,0

The point of the boolean is to control whether you found or not a non_nucleotide. Like Larry said before its called a flag that changes under certain conditions.. In this case it can be used in both ways whether you initialize it as True and change to False or vice-versa. Do it your way and call it whatever you want as long as it changes when you find a non-nucleotide., Resolved,0
