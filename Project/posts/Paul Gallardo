Tuesday October 1st 2013 5:09 pm -04:00,Hi TomThank you for your feedback and I just did follow the pseudocode but when I run it this is what I got;[[E] [F] [J] [A] [J] [C] [O] [W] [S] [S]  [S] [D] [G] [K] [S] [R] [F] [D] [F] [F]  [A] [S] [R] [J] [D] [U] [S] [K] [L] [K]  [H] [E] [A] [N] [D] [N] [D] [J] [W] [A]  [A] [N] [S] [D] [N] [C] [N] [E] [O] [P]  [P] [M] [S] [N] [F] [H] [H] [E] [J] [E]  [J] [E] [P] [Q] [L] [Y] [N] [X] [D] [L] ]there are some empty outerlist = for i in file_o1:    innerlist =     i = i.rstrip()    for e in i:        innerlist.append(e)    outerlist.append(innerlist)print(outerlist)#assign emtpy list to variable1    #create for loop to read the index of the function parameter        #assign empty list to variable2        #use rstrip for new line on the index variable in the for loop.        #create a 2nd for loop to read the character inside the index variable            #append the variable2 with the character variable inside the 2nd for loop        #append the variable1 with the variable2 outside the 2nd for loop and inside the 1st for loop    #return the 1st variable.Appreciate if you could guide me what I did wrong with., Resolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 5:30 pm -04:00,Actually here is the source I made it like this in order for me to check if the output is ok.file_l1 = \\Users\\pvrgallardo\\Downloads\\board1.txt <- this is the location of the filefile_o1 = open(file_l1 r).read()outerlist = for i in file_o1:    innerlist =     i = i.rstrip()    for e in i:        innerlist.append(e)    outerlist.append(innerlist)print(outerlist) <- i used print function instead return as return functions gives me error in the shelland if I used only the board_file it will give error and I cannot check if the output is ok or not. but i will correct it once the output is ok., Resolved,1
