Saturday September 21st 2013 12:38 pm -04:00,Just curious how fail safe we are to make these...A few thoughts:1. Within insert_sequence should we validate the 2 dna parameters sent (using/calling is_valid_sequence) or do we assume that theyve already been validated?  2.  again within the insert_sequence function for the index parameter do we test that the index is not greater than the length of dna1?I feel like the instructions would have asked us to validate if needed  but Im unsure as it seems these should be validated., Resolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 12:42 pm -04:00,I just reread the instructions - I think we assume the parameters coming in to insert_sequence have already been validated.  Otherwise the instructions do not provide details as to what to return (from insert_sequence) if the validations from within insert_sequence fail..., Resolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 12:50 pm -04:00,I worry a little because the function will run with invalid dna strings but will crash/fail if index is greater than dna string 1., Resolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 12:52 pm -04:00,Sorry - It says we can assume index is valid...  Apologies., Resolved,0
