Monday August 19th 2013 8:51 pm -04:00,Are there answers for the exercises in the bookI get -17 in idle but it doesnt really answer the question.2. Unary minus negates a number. Unary plus exists as well; for examplePython understands +5. If x has the value -17 what do you think +xshould do? Should it leave the sign of the number alone? Should it actlike absolute value removing any negation? Use the Python shell to findout its behaviour., Resolved,0

Tuesday September 24th 2013 11:03 pm -04:00,Was lst declared as a variable ie lst = . Was list declared as a variable list =  it sounds like you are not understanding when something has been declared as a variable. Id need actual examples to really answer this question. Did you try to declare list as a variable for the while loop as the code calling list might be testing you to see if you have noticed that you need to add it in order for this to work?, Unresolved,0
