Sunday September 22nd 2013 3:55 pm -04:00,Hi- when I run my python idle module (which has been downloaded and edited according the instructions) I cant get my is_valid_sequence to call properly in the shell. The functions that were already input (contains_sequence is_longer count_nucleotides etc) all work properly and return correct results. After defining is_valid function and calling it in the shell i get the following:>>> is_valid_sequence(GTCA)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#16> line 1 in <module>    is_valid_sequence(GTCA)NameError: name GTCA is not defined>>> contains_sequence(ATCGGC GG)TrueI was confident that my code was correct however and after submitting it I got credit for it even though it wont run properly. Im on insert_sequence now and it is doing the same thing however that code still needs to be corrected. any insight? my indents etc all look correct and there are no syntax errors when I click run., Resolved,0
