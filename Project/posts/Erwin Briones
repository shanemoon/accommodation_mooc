Tuesday August 20th 2013 3:43 am -04:00,I think Algorithm & Problem solving is an essential tool that is not learned or lectured in school.  Its different its something your born with (or life-experiences or work experiences are good examples in how you problem solve) but of course the way your nurtured and educated (e.g. math & critical logical thinking)  is a huge factor in how you problem solve.  I was way too ambitious in taking an algorithm class at a night college and had to drop it due to a weak foundation in programming and understanding. Read up on Pseudocode and FLowChart understanding.  ,None,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 3:51 am -04:00,Some notes i took at a night college in how to make a sound program: •Understand the problem•Plan the logic–Flowchart(Graphical)–Pseudocode (Textual)–Walkthrough the logic before coding by desk-checking the logic•Code the program–Selectthe programming language•Somelanguages more efficient for certain tasks•Alllanguages handle input arithmetic processing output other standard functions•Logiccan be executed in any number of languages•Use software to translate the program to machine language•Test the program–Executeit with sample data and check results–Identifylogic errors and correct them–Choosetest data carefully to exercise all branches of the logic•Put the program into production–Mightmean simply running the program once–Processmight take months if program is used on regular basis or is part of largerdevelopment–Traindata-entry people and users–Changeexisting data–Conversion: entire set ofactions organization must take to switch over to new program(s),None,0
