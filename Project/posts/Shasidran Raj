Friday September 13th 2013 11:58 am -04:00,I have written the entire code for the assignment and tested the code with both the examples given in the handout and my own and it works exactly as it should giving the right answers. But when I had submitted it I only got 18/24 and it says the rest are error. As anyone else had this problem and can someone please look into this for me., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 1:17 am -04:00,I am getting most of the errors for the get_complementary_sequence function. but when i run the code in IDLE I get AT when i put in TA and the right answer for the rest. One of the error comments was check with the example but when i did i still got the right answer., Unresolved,0
