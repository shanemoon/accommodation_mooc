Tuesday October 1st 2013 12:32 pm -04:00,Hi again Ive tried all of the above suggested solutions but its still not working ! I even tried downloading the assignment and re-writing it and still the score is 0/37 and the same error ... Still need all of your help !!Thank you all for the help :), Unresolved,2
Tuesday October 1st 2013 3:26 pm -04:00,Oh I found my mistake . I had imported files and closed files .. So I guess because I imported tkinter I also imported sys module indirectly . So thats what my error was . Once I removed the import  open and close statements i finally got some mark other than 0/37 ! :) Oh and also if you dont understand sys module try using help() in your idle and then typing sys at the next prompt ... It gives you a lot of information about sys ... But I suggest you dont do that because it just confuses you a bit :-P Thanks !, Unresolved,0
