Friday August 30th 2013 5:30 pm -04:00,I noticed that in the updated docstring for the area function in the triangle.py doc in this video the Type Contract still says:(number number) -> numberIsnt the returned value always a float because of the / operator in the function? Should it be (number number) -> float instead?Thanks!, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 12:07 pm -04:00,The Type Contract definition and examples are just part of a docstring so it wont affect whether or not the function works. You could type anything there and still be able to call the function. However we follow the recipe we learned in this weeks lectures to help ourselves and other programmers understand the functions we wrote by using the help function. In the recipe video the professor changed the Type from number to float in the Type Contract when the final operator of the function was / because the result would always be returned as a float type. I was just curious why that wasnt changed in the video - if theres something Im missing or if it was a small mistake., Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 4:57 pm -04:00,Agree! I am so pleased with how much I am enjoying this course! Everything is really clear and the pace is great. I love being able to rewind lectures and watch parts that didnt make sense (or I accidentally didnt pay attention to heh) a second or even third time. GREAT class so far - really looking forward to the next few weeks!,None,1
