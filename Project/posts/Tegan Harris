Saturday September 21st 2013 10:40 pm -04:00,Hi everyoneIve submitted assignment 2 and I get two failures for my get_complementary_sequence function (see failure messages below).I have read the how to read failure messages thread but I am still failing to understand what this means. I have tested the function using the handout example and I have tested the function using the input DNA sequence as AATTGGCC (along with many other tests) and they all work fine.Any help would be appreciated please.Method Description:Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?Message:FAILURE: AssertionError != TA+ TA : Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?Method Description:Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences        of each nucleotide?Message:FAILURE: AssertionError != TAGCTAGC+ TAGCTAGC : Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences            of each nucleotide?, Unresolved,0
