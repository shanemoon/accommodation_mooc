You must have finished this weeks series.2. You must have familiarity of roots (Square and Cube roots)3. You must be familiar with the print function (print() )4. You must not be tired. Attempt this exercise when youre feeling ready.Instructions: Create 2 functions.1. roots - define a function called roots that takes the parameters number and root.2. power - define a function called power that takes the parameters number and exponent.Description: This program will test your familiarity of Parenthesis Exponentiation and Division operators Function Definition and Variables. If you know the print function (print() ) use it. If you dont just run it in the IDLE like this:# Press F5 to the editor to use the codes.>>> roots(25 2)5.0>>> roots(27 3)3.0>>> power(10 2)100>>> power(2.5 3)15.625Rules:1. You may search the internet for the formula as long as its not coded in python.2. Please use The Python Visualizer and set the version to 3.3 there is a Generate URL button. please post your link when youre done.3. Please dont use the math module. The purpose of this puzzle will be useless if you used it to solve the 2 functions.Edit: Sorry guys I have misled you with the parameters for power. But you are free to name it whatever you like so long as the program works.After you finished your program click the Generate URL and post the link here. Feel free to ask me some questions :DThe code will be revealed in Sunday.

I thank the instructors for providing a clear and concise enough lectures to become a better programmer.The quizzes are challenging and requires deep thinking.The Assignments were... a little too hard (I couldnt perfect it :()The exam was... not that hard (to those who reviewed the concepts :P)I thank my peers for helping me solve my assignment problems.  I couldnt help anymore in the forums like the others did since I have no time :(Good luck to those who are reviewing for the exam and if you really love programming... this exam will be a piece of cake :D,None,3
