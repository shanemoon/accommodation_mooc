Sunday September 1st 2013 11:10 pm -04:00,To become a good programmer it takes dedication practice and writing lots and lots of code.Its also a good idea to learn several languages specially those with different approaches (paradigms) to solving computing problems.Some of the posters before me also mentioned math which I think is a necessary skill for being a good programmer. Arithmetic algebra and calculus are things that will help you a lot they improve logical thinking and problem solving skills.Good thread! Keep up the great work everyone!,None,0

Thursday August 22nd 2013 9:05 am -04:00,I wholeheartedly recommend the following as theyve helped me a lot!Codecademy: You can check it out at www.codecademy.com. This is a great site with an interactive learning environment and a great community You can learn Python but also other languages like Ruby PHP JavaScript etc. Highly recommended.Learn Python The Hard Way: Available at learnpythonthehardway.org. I highly recommend this one. Its very technical and requires a lot of repetition and memorization but hey this is the method proposed by this author Zed Shaw and it DOES work great. I really recommend this one but theres a catch: It uses Python 2.x to teach you so there are some differences with Python 3. However as many people have pointed in the forums most of what you learn with Python 2.x can be used with Python 3 so thats not an absolute obstacle.Wikipedia: The good old Wikipedia. Read the articles about Python Guido Van Rossum Programming languages etc. This will teach you a lot of good stuff and even might pique your curiosity for technical aspects or terms you dont know so you might end up learning a whole lot more! I love to just browse around and learn new things.Great thread by the way!, Pinned Approved,0

The two versions kind of coexist together with 2.x still having broader support and resources available for obvious reasons but 3 gaining more and more traction each day.Probably one day Python 3 will be the most used version of the language but as others have pointed out there is no problem with learning 2.x and 3 or in which order for that matter.

Monday August 19th 2013 9:45 pm -04:00,As others have pointed out Python is just one of many languages out there and if youre serious about programming maybe you should learn a few of them to have a good toolbox to tackle coding problems. Python is good as a general-purpose language but you might want to add others to your repertoire like Java C++ Lisp etc. The more the better.

Sunday August 25th 2013 10:07 am -04:00,There are many text editor programs out there some are free some require you to buy a license. IDLE is just an interactive environment that comes included with most Python installations/packages and it includes a fairly basic text editor with features like syntax highlighting and indentation.Since there are way too many text editors and IDEs (like Eclipse for example) out there I suggest you try them out to see which one you like the most. I personally plan to use IDLE for this course as it is very introductory and the features of IDLE will be more than enough for this task. When I code I usually work on Notepad++ which is free and has many nice features.I checked the website of this Sublime Text program (first time I hear of it) and it looks really nice. You have to buy it though so if youre learning Id recommend you to use a free one like Notepad++ and see if you like it!, Unresolved,1

Sunday August 25th 2013 4:49 pm -04:00,Are you sure you mean Interface? Interface is not related to the language at all. Interface is related to the environment you use to write and test your code. Python has some similarities (keywords operators some syntax) with other OOP languages but it also has some unique characteristics like using words and or and not instead of symbolic operators (like C++s && || for example).Any other characteristics or similarities you find might be related to the fact that most programming languages share a lot of concepts and sometimes syntax is quite similar., Resolved,1

Sunday August 25th 2013 6:17 pm -04:00,Theres no best programming language. Its like saying theres a best language. Languages are just that means of communication. In the specific case of programming languages you can find statistics which include for example the language most used by professional software developers the language with less keywords and syntactic rules and many other quantifiable metrics. But these alone cant determine if theres a best language. Ask this question to 10 programmers and you will probably get 10 different answers! Some will say Java others will say C++ others will say C others will say C# etc.Some of them will even tell you that if youre serious about programming you should learn several different programming languages.However Python is a solid choice for many reasons. It is widely considered a good language for newcomers to programming mainly due to its automatic memory management clean syntax and cross-platform support. Python can be your gateway to other more advanced languages like C++ or the aforementioned Java., Unresolved,3
Sunday August 25th 2013 6:24 pm -04:00,Yes Benjamin. You can use Python to work on GUI and database applications too. This is also one of the strengths of Python: Its a general purpose programming language suited for almost any computational task you need to perform. Another BIG plus is that there is a huge codebase out there even bigger if we include all Python 2.x packages. So yes you can work GUI and DB applications with Python.Were using IDLE and text output only because this is an introductory course., Unresolved,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 4:52 pm -04:00,Yes it is possible Martin. Remember you can modify the order in which the expression is solved by using parentheses (). Try grouping the addition and subtraction operations.Remember that the parts within () will be evaluated first., Unresolved,0

Sunday August 25th 2013 5:55 pm -04:00,What happens in Python is that an assignment statement like area = base * height assigns the evaluation of the expression base * height to the area variable so if you later in the code change the values that variables base and height refer to you just changed the memory address in those two variables (they will now point to the new values). If you want to change area youd have to recompute it using the new base and height values.I wouldnt say this is counter-intuitive but it is Pythons way of doing things. A way of avoiding this is to define a function to calculate the area with the base and height params. That way each time you call the function you will pass arguments to it and get a result., Unresolved,2
Sunday August 25th 2013 6:09 pm -04:00,Yeah but theres no point discussing this because its just the way Python works. area points to a specific memory address that has the 100.0 value on it so until you recalculate it you will never have an updated value. Other than that wed have to ask Mr. Van Rossum to get an explanation about the why. Why did he decide that Python worked this way? Hes probably the one who knows hehe, Unresolved,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 6:19 pm -04:00,I will try to find Guido Van Rossums rationale for this but I assume its probably more related to the fact that IDLE which is the main tool most of us are using here works like a Shell so it has a state (with state I refer to the current values stored at memory addresses to which variables point. They change only when you change the memory addresses that values point to).If I find any article that explains this (and its not too technical) Ill be sure to share with you!, Unresolved,2
Monday August 26th 2013 10:08 am -04:00,Yes this is the beauty of Python. Its part of the philosophy of the language! This is a quote from the Wikipedia article about the Python programming language:***begin quote***The core philosophy of the language is summarized by the document PEP 20 (The Zen of Python) which includes aphorisms such as:[32]Beautiful is better than ugly.Explicit is better than implicit.Simple is better than complex.Complex is better than complicated.Readability counts.Rather than requiring all desired functionality to be built into the languages core Python was designed to be highly extensible. Python can also be embedded in existing applications that need a programmable interface. This design of a small core language with a large standard library and an easily extensible interpreter was intended by Van Rossum from the very start because of his frustrations with ABC (which espoused the opposite mindset).[19]While offering choice in coding methodology the Python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax such as in Perl in favor of a sparser less-cluttered grammar. As Alex Martelli put it: To describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.[33] Pythons philosophy rejects the Perl there is more than one way to do it approach to language design in favor of there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.[32]***end quote***PS: I ended up buying the book and I find it great. I give my thanks to the authors for not only devoting their time to this course but for writing a great book that Im sure will help lots of people to program in Python!, Resolved,0

Monday August 26th 2013 11:58 pm -04:00,Python strings can use either single quotes double quotes or triple single quotes / double quotes (but this is only used for docstrings or strings that span multiple lines).All of these styles are valid in Python and I guess what is really important is that you keep a consistent coding style throughout your source code files.Hope this helps you!, Resolved,2
Tuesday August 27th 2013 8:27 am -04:00,Yeah what Gerry said.The subtle thing happening here is that in one instance youre calling the print function and in the other one you are just getting the value that variable s refers to. Try it out on IDLE: Use print() to output strings with single triple and double triple quotes and then store a single triple and double triple string on variables and try outputting the value referred by these variables., Resolved,1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:35 pm -04:00,I think thats just the way the Python interpreter works and represents strings because no matter if you type a string in single double or triple singles or doubles you will always get a single quoted representation.Ex:>>> hellohello>>> hellohello>>> hellohello>>> hellohello>>> , Resolved,1

Tuesday August 27th 2013 11:41 am -04:00,Thats not the problem. You can use triple single quotes for multi-line strings. I dont know what the problem is I copy pasted the code in my IDLE and it worked just fine.,None,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 3:55 pm -04:00,There are already many threads like this but Ill try my best to answer this.Programming languages are just tools. They all serve for one purpose: To tell the computer instructions to perform computational tasks.Most general-purpose programming languages (including Python) are well suited for development of pretty much any type of program you need. As for which language is better? I think theres no real answer for this. All languages have pros and cons. Python for instance is acclaimed for its simplicity clean syntax and huge codebase (even bigger and more versatile if you work with Python 2.x). Some critics say Python is slower than compiled languages such as C/C++. However computers are becoming faster each year so this is not that big of a problem and since most people use Python for data processing or to create scripts to automate repetitive tasks this is not a hurdle at all.What I would recomment to you if youre dead serious about learning to program and depending on the level of expertise you want to attain is that you learn a few languages. You should learn at least 5 or 6 languages in-depth and try for yourself different approaches (sometims called paradigms) of computer programming. That way youll get a deep knowledge of how computers really work and will be able to pretty much tackle every imaginable computing problem!Good luck in your journey!,None,4
Tuesday August 27th 2013 4:17 pm -04:00,Functional programming is gaining momentum indeed. I myself want to learn Haskell and maybe Clojure. However I quote Pythons BDFL on his recent Slashdot Q&A when asked about functional programming:functional programming by ebno-10dbSome people claim that Python is at least partly a functional language. You disagree as do I. Simply having a few map and filter type functions does not make for a functional language. As I understand it those functions were added to the libraries by a homesick Lisper and that several times youve been tempted to eliminate them. In general it seems youre not a fan of functional programming at least for Python.Question: do you feel that the functional programming approach is not very useful in general or simply that its not appropriate for Python? It would be nice to hear your reasons either way. Guido: Im not a fan of religiously taking some idea to the extreme and I try to be pragmatic in my design choices (but not *too* pragmatic see the start of this sentence :-). I value readability and usefulness for real code. There are some places where map() and filter() make sense and for other places Python has list comprehensions. I ended up hating reduce() because it was almost exclusively used (a) to implement sum() or (b) to write unreadable code. So we added builtin sum() at the same time we demoted reduce() from a builtin to something in functools (which is a dumping ground for stuff I dont really care about :-).If I think of functional programming I mostly think of languages that have incredibly powerful compilers like Haskell. For such a compiler the functional paradigm is useful because it opens up a vast array of possible transformations including parallelization. But Pythons compiler has no idea what your code means and thats useful too. So mostly I dont think it makes much sense to try to add functional primitives to Python because the reason those primitives work well in functional languages dont apply to Python and they make the code pretty unreadable for people who arent used to functional languages (which means most programmers).I also dont think that the current crop of functional languages is ready for mainstream. Admittedly I dont know much about the field besides Haskell but any language *less* popular than Haskell surely has very little practical value and I havent heard of functional languages *more* popular than Haskell. As for Haskell I think its a great proving ground for all sorts of ideas about compiler technology but I think its purity will always remain in the way of adoption. Having to come to grips with Monads just isnt worth it for most people.(A similar comment applies to Scala. It may be the best you can do trying to combine functional and OO paradigms in one language but the result isnt all that easy to use unless youre really smart.)You can read the full Q&A here: http://developers.slashdot.org/story/13/08/25/2115204/interviews-guido-van-rossum-answers-your-questions.

Wednesday August 28th 2013 6:50 am -04:00,Sure Lakka but theres good coding style guidelines that shouldve followed they lead to cleaner code and help people understand what they are reading.

Tuesday August 27th 2013 9:40 pm -04:00,The docstring will make the pop-up appear with the type contract for the function. Also if you call the help() passing the function name as an argument you should get the complete docstring returned as output. Did you try this out?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 3:49 pm -04:00,Preconditions are part of the docstring because they tell the user of the code that those particular functions will only return adequate results if the arguments passed meet the preconditions expressed. Theyre like a guarantee of sorts: The functions will return valid results if called with certain arguments.Sorry for being so verbose! Hope you get it!, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 4:32 pm -04:00,Double check your indents. Remember that Python is very sensible to whitespace so indentation not only must be present it must be consistent across the code to avoid having errors related to it.Good luck!, Resolved,0

This should work for different programming languages (with minor changes or adaptations).As for a standard recipe for designing programs I wouldnt say there is one. Some people develop software from scratch coding in their IDE or editor of choice with little planning some others are very methodical writing algorithms to solve each piece of the problem and then joining those chunks together to solve a bigger problem.If you want to get more in-depth you can always learn a lot from Wikipedia!

Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:16 pm -04:00,String is a data type. Variables are containers for memory addresses which refer to the data contained within (this data could be a string for instance but it could be an int or a float or a function). They are not the same so be careful and dont confuse them., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:28 pm -04:00,Strings are always between quotes be it single double or triple single/double quotes.So city is a variable and city city or city are strings., Resolved,6

Tuesday August 27th 2013 10:13 pm -04:00,I dont think its fair to say the instructors are not being clear or the instructions are vague. While its true that this is an introductory course its pretty much on par with the level of a similar course at the University so you need to devote a few hours to it each week. Some people might need to devote even more hours (the course info page estimates a weekly workload of 6-8 hours so I assume that it might include watching the Video Lectures more than once asking questions and researching for yourself too there are plenty of resources out there just a single google search away!).At any rate if you need assistance try asking on the forums or on the many student groups there might be even a group that speaks your native language in case english is an additional layer of complication for you.Hope this helps and I wish you good luck in the course!, Unresolved,5
Wednesday August 28th 2013 2:32 pm -04:00,Yeah I guess figuring out stuff on your own is part of developing the critical thinking required to become a proficient coder. I understand some people might find it off-putting but you have to endure it do research read again and again re-watch the videos. If you stick to it you will soon understand. Dont know how to call this when things start making sense they just click! So dont panic take a deep breath and just enjoy the ride!

Do you understand what just happened?>>> test = I say:Im testing triple quotes>>> testI say:I\m testing triple quotes>>> print(test)I say:Im testing triple quotes>>> Remember its not the same to output the data referred by a variable (ie. >>> test) than using the data as argument for the print() function., Resolved,7
Tuesday August 27th 2013 10:51 pm -04:00,Hello there Sonia. The handout file contains enough hints there so I suggest you read it carefully. If you are still stuck I could try to give you some hints but its difficult without giving the answer and thats a big no no as it goes against the Honor Code.So try reading the assignment handout very carefully and pay special attention to the operators and the examples., Resolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 11:45 am -04:00,The course is intended for total newcomers to programming but maybe they mention some math concepts for example that they will probably not explain so it might lead to some confusion. Also as you mentioned no matter how introductory they try to make the lectures they will introduce a lot of terms that are technical programming terms that you will have to learn by heart. So my advice would be to watch the lectures more than once pause them every time you encounter a term you dont get research the term online or ask some questions in this board and then try to watch it again to see if you get it.It will require some practice but its the only way to go theres no other possibility you need to become familiar with all the jargon until it is second nature for you.Keep it up!, Unresolved,0

Wednesday August 28th 2013 4:21 pm -04:00,Hi Anna!You need to indent all the lines of code after the function header. That includes the docstring (the green part which describes the function). Align all lines with 4 spaces and try it again. It should work perfectly!, Resolved,2

Has it been smooth sailing for you or have you had troubles? Any particular happenings? Are you up to speed with the content or are you struggling with a particular concept? What are you up to at the moment?I finished the exercises and the assignment without major problems. I had some difficulties with the assignment but then I decided to let it rest for a couple of hours and then when I came back to it I saw my problem as clear as the day and managed to finish it successfully!Ive been trying to help as many people here as I can and also on the Facebook groups and Ive been practicing with the textbook exercises as well. Also watched a couple of keynotes by Guido van Rossum Pythons creator. They are a bit technical but I still find them enlightening and they give me topics to further my research.So tl;dr version: What are you up to and hows it going so far?,None,1

Friday August 30th 2013 9:54 pm -04:00,Great post Jim!Ive helped some people about the Assignment here and read tons of threads about it and I think your advice is spot on!Id add the following:- Read the instructions very carefully. Read them more than once and then read them again. I found myself overthinking a problem just because I read them fast and when I took another look at them the problem seemed clear as day to me! So read them slowly pay attention and read them again. If you are unsure about a term double check it thats a great way to finally memorize concepts and terminology.- If you find yourself stuck on a problem dont brute force it. Sure time is running but take a small break or tackle the problem the next day. This is very helpful as you come fresh and might spot something you missed or might come with a new way of thinking to tackle the problem at hand.At any rate I wish everyone good luck with this Assignment!

Thursday August 29th 2013 8:55 pm -04:00,I think what they want you to get from the design recipe is a proven algorithm for coming up with functions to solve your coding problems. There might be other methods but this is the one the instructors are using and it seems to work. But other than that dont overthink it its just a way to streamline your coding and do it in a similar fashion everytime you need to come up with functions (which as others pointed out will be VERY frequently)., Unresolved,1

Thursday August 29th 2013 10:35 am -04:00,Because you cant store the value of a print statement in a variable so you cant really do something like return = sum(1 3) unless the sum() function returns a value. Check this code out:>>> def add(num1 num2):	print(num1 + num2)	>>> add(1 3)4>>> result = add(1 3)4>>> result>>> As you can see if you assign the variable result a function call add(1 3) you will get a printed result on the screen but when you call the result variable to see the value its referring to you dont get anything back because its a None type.Also remember that sum() is a built-in function. Dont use names of built-ins for your own function declarations!Hope this helps., Unresolved,3
Thursday August 29th 2013 2:31 pm -04:00,Theres no difference in the output both functions do the same. The only difference is that the first function definition returns the value referenced by the the variable result and the second function returns the result of evaluating the expression num_hours * 60 directly.I prefer the second function myself its a lot cleaner (and less code typed less chance of typing errors!)., Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 2:28 pm -04:00,Consider this code means that the answer will be based on you reading and interpreting the code they give you.For example if I say:Consider this code:>>> def add(num1 num2):        return num1 + num2How many parameters does the add() function definition have?What is the answer?, Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 8:58 pm -04:00,Yeah a Tom said you have plenty of time to learn some Java before that course starts. What you learn here about programming concepts will certainly benefit you greatly as programming concepts and practices are more or less language agnostic or at least between similar languages (both Python and Java are OOP so what you learn about classes can be useful too).

Thursday August 29th 2013 8:48 pm -04:00,You are getting the type error because your function definition doesnt return a value it just prints out the sum of the two params.
