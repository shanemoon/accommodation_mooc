The one refers to the IDLE interaction screen and the other to the new window that you are opening when you want to create a new function. The rest is maximization., Resolved,2
Wednesday September 4th 2013 2:54 pm -04:00,At the Lecture Summary is mentioned that the float built in function accepts as arguments a string containing only digits and zero or one decimal points (possibly with a leading minus sign -).But when i write the function float containing as an argument a string of a number with 2 decimal points it is accepted.  But according to the Summary it should print me ValueError.For example:>>> float (-43.21)>>> -43.21Also when i apply this to the int built in function it prints the ValueError although it is not mentioned at the Summary.For example:>>> int (-43.21)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#84> line 1 in     int(-43.21)ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: -43.21I m sorry for the big length of the question..Please can anyone help me understand what i misunderstood?, Resolved,0

Thank you very very much!Etienne you re right about to be or not to be an s behind the point but it not only a typographic mistake thats why i mentioned that. Try what i wrote about the int function because it isnt mentioned at the Summary., Resolved,0
