Monday September 2nd 2013 2:36 am -04:00,Agree 100%. The first time I was introduced to code was at my intern job in 2011. I felt like I was reading Greek. So my boss hands me this deitel book on how to program in c++ fourth edition. I gotta say the way it breaks it down you can know nothing about code and understand what they are telling you. Its something I recommend as a first read. After the first 5 chapters and a year passed of just thinking about algorithms and code structure. I went from knowing nothing to beginner.It really does take a lot of time for all this stuff to sink in but once it does you will have much more fun with it.Another good read I recommend is The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers. This tells you how to deal in a programming environment without actually having to go into any code. It help me setup my thinking to be able to read/write code., Resolved,0

Monday September 16th 2013 5:22 pm -04:00,For: http://clasher.myweb.uga.edu/testpages/seqconv.htmlEntering nothing before hitting convert will get you back nothing (other than True but not printed out). Is this the expected compement of an empty string? Maybe I didnt read DNA sequence deep enough.http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/rev_comp.htmlhitting submit with nothing in the box will give an error print asking to enter something.I think this is where the confusion lies.

Monday September 16th 2013 3:34 pm -04:00,Yeah its kind of a trick question. Although I still think there should be a return message such as Error: Please input DNA sequence to get complementary.

Monday September 16th 2013 5:28 pm -04:00,Yup most of us who thought to put in a what if health check for empty string in our code fell for the same thing. Thats the reason for this whole charade.The only thing I think it is relevant to is TDD. I think its dwindled down to more of a science vs code topic.One side of the argument (science theory):nucleotide has complements but complements cannot complement themselves because complement operation is only defined for actual nucleotides.Other side of the argument (coding):Inputing a complement into an empty string would make the code return it as true therefor an empty string should return as true.Should be interesting to see where this goes., Unresolved,1
Monday September 16th 2013 4:17 am -04:00,I recommend taking this course with a grain of salt. I didnt first look at python code till 3 months before taking this course. I was force to create a function that adds a hack using regex with a selenium script. Since we have this monster automation system with a bunch of hacks thrown together (since they wont provide us with resources to properly program the thing) I figured Id be doing myself a favor taking this free course. This way when I get pulled into the machine I wont be 100% lost just 60% lost :)In all honesty though I find just write up some automation scripts for yourself in python and use stack overflow as a good resource tool. As far as this class is concerned there are a few good techniques I have already picked up that I can use. Since this course is free you cant beat that :)Once my contract ends Im thinking of starting my own project to write up some programs (maybe some games too). Its an exciting start of a new career for me. You have to use the programming you do with something you enjoy or you wont learn much.Also keep in mind in the real world you will get people asking you what to write for when they dont even know what the real problem is they want you to solve. Half the battle is just finding out what the problem is. That is why I am putting time into this course.1. See if I can understand the real problem from the incomplete/misleading questions.2. Once I understand exactly what the system is looking for come up with my own algorithm to solve the problem.If I can do it (which to my suprize have done so far) Im satisfied with that and enjoy beating the challange.,None,1
Monday September 16th 2013 1:33 pm -04:00,your approach to tinkering around is exactly what everybody on this course should be doing. Thats the only way to really learn something.Ditto that is why I created a username on stackoverflow known as fiddlefreak.
