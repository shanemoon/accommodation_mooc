Thursday October 3rd 2013 10:25 am -04:00,I dont understand the question in the quiz though either. How can ds values are immutable be a precondition of the function? Arent the values of a dict by definition mutable? I agree that the values become immutable in the new dict that is returned by the function where they are keys but why and how could they be immutable in the first place?Seems like the precondition should be more like If I decide to change the old d dicts values I wont need this new dict to reflect that in its keys. , Unresolved,3
