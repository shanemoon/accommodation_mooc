Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:51 am -04:00,I am using a macbook pro to do this course. Whenever I type _ it doesnt appear in either IDLE shell or .py files. You can see this in the screen shot above. The parameters for definition seconds_difference are time_1 and time_2. I had syntax problems to run this module because I first thought they were time 1 and time 2.Â Does anyone have the same problem? How can I make them appear? Please help me!, Unresolved,0
