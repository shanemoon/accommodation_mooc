Friday September 6th 2013 1:40 pm -04:00,I really enjoyed this challenge.  I tried not to look at any other solutions before doing my own.  Using only what we have been taught up till week 3 I was unable to come up with a solution.  Knowing a bit of basic from back in the day I looked up the syntax for a while loop.  Below is my resulting code.  According to others here the output is accurate. The code runs in 38 seconds on my laptop.I failed math in high school..  4 times..def collatz_num(num):     int -> int    Returns the number of links in the chain starting at any given integer for the collatz conjecture    >>> collatz_num(3)    7        counter = 1    while num != 1:        if num % 2 == 0:            num = num / 2        else:            num = num * 3 + 1        counter = counter + 1    return counterdef high_collatz_num(num):     int -> int    Returns the highest number the collatz chain reaches    >>> high_collatz_num(3)    16.0        counter = 0    largest_num = 0        while num != 1:        if num % 2 == 0:            num = num / 2        else:            num = num * 3 + 1        counter = counter + 1        if num > largest_num:            largest_num = num            return int(largest_num)iteration = 1high_chain = 0high_num = 0while iteration < 1000000:    test_num = collatz_num(iteration)    if test_num > high_chain:        high_chain = test_num        high_num = iteration    iteration = iteration + 1print(The longest chain was  high_chain  numbers long)print(This number was producted using a seed value of  high_num)print(The largest number in that chain was  high_collatz_num(high_num)),None,0

Windows Linux and Mac.  I tend to use each for what their good at.  If I want to play a game or do some photo management / home tasks its all on the home windows machine.  If i need to log in and get work done ( IT company ) I do so on my linux box as I manage a few hundred linux serves it just makes everything consistent and easy.   My laptop is a MAC however for the reasons listed above ( Unix based OS built in ssh etc ). Its very compatible with my work environment and I can admin it the same way I admin my servers in a text file :)  Depending on the type of programming you want to do one flavor of OS might suit you better.  Dont forget VMs today mean you can run every OS on your new computer :),None,0
