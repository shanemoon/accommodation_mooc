Tuesday September 17th 2013 12:48 am -04:00,Hi Jac-MartiSubtitles work with most of todays media players and they will recognize the subtitles(.srt files) automatically if they are in the same folder.If they are not in the same folder you have to point the player to the subtitles (which you can do by dragging the file on the player)Make sure you are downloading .srt files. Renaming .txt to .srt dont work(since renaming extension dont change the underlying format of the files), Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 3:22 am -04:00,Tolunay OrkunYour first 2 examples did not work for me.Here is what I got for your examples:>>> x=(range(1102))>>> xrange(1 10 2)>>> x=(range(1102)*3)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#28> line 1 in     x=(range(1102)*3)TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: range and intAdding list to the first one (as Tom explained) worked for me and second one still returned same error.I think they only work in versions before Python 3., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 7:28 am -04:00,There is (logical) mistake  in your code.Reason for the error:you are passing string (s) to get_complement and its not matching with any of the if conditions in the function body so returns None which you are concatenation to dna_sequence.String concatenation needs both operands to be of type string. If they are not of type string python converts them  automatically. Hence the error Cant convert NoneType object to str implicitly, Resolved,2
Wednesday September 18th 2013 9:04 am -04:00,I did not get what exactly your doubt is but when the string 0123456789  is multiplied by 2 and added a space it gives 01234567890123456789 Try this:>>> s = 0123456789>>> s * 2 +  01234567890123456789 , Resolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 9:33 am -04:00,The code doest multiply the whole string by 2 instead it multiplies each digit(or character) by 2 and concatenates them.result is initialized with null string() not space( )., Resolved,1
Wednesday September 18th 2013 11:57 am -04:00,The questions says at most 3 times which means 0 1 2 or 3 times but the code above removes the song even if it is there in the list for 3 times because of equality., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 12:33 pm -04:00,yeah it works for all the cases in which song appears in the list for either 01 or 2 times but it fails for cases in which song appears 3 times. Thats why its an invalid option.Edit: The code continuous even if the count  equals 3 and hence fails for cases that has the song appeared for 3 times(or more)., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 12:55 am -04:00,Rich Friedel I think you got me wrong.The above comment is an extension to my earlier post (above here).My intention is that the code continuous even if the count  equals 3 and hence fails for cases that has the song appeared for 3 times(or more).May be I should edit the comment to make it more clear., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 12:40 am -04:00,[ ] is used to index elements of a collection that supports indexing through its elements.List and string are covered in the lectures(till now). List is a collection of elements and string is a collection of characters.Ex: To refer an element of a collection S at index i we use indexing notation S[i]., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 12:08 am -04:00,The question says:The while loop stops as soon as an even number is found and the sum of all the previous numbers is returned.So you have to look for a  for_version(L) that stops adding numbers as soon as an even number is found in the list.Only one of the answer does it and rest dont.The test case(s) you have to consider to check for valid answer is to take a list that has an even number any where between the list (Ex: 2nd and 3rd cases in your screenshot) and check if it stops adding the numbers after that.Answer should be same for all cases not just some cases., Unresolved Locked,1
Thursday September 19th 2013 2:00 am -04:00,no more than 3 occurrences of song means that if the song appears more than 3 times you need to remove the extra occurrences.Stating clearly:The list will be untouched if it contains the song for 0 1 2 or 3 times.The list will be modified to contain the song 3 times if it contains the song more than 3 times.One of the cases where the code with >= fails:Take a list that has a song for 3 times. The list satisfies the condition that it has the song no more than 3 occurrences and hence list need no modifications but the code with >= modifies the code by removing the song which makes it invalid., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 2:18 am -04:00,The list will be untouched if it contains the song for 0 1 2 or 3 times.Where in the instructions does it state this?I dont know where(& why) you are confusing. The wording Make sure there are no more than 3 occurrences of song in playlist. says that., Unresolved,2
Thursday September 19th 2013 2:58 am -04:00,I think you are seeing from the perspective of resultant playlist.What the question is to make sure that the given(or original) playlist has no more than 3 occurrences of song and if it does then do the needful., Unresolved,0

Thursday September 19th 2013 10:00 am -04:00,I did notice that the actual name of the function perimeter is used in the description for semiperimeter but was this on purpose? Should it not say Return the semiperimeter of a triangle....I think its a mistake in thecourse material. It should be Return the semiperimeter of a triangle.... Refer video for function reuse in which it is correctly written.My question is how or should I mention this when designing the original function?You need not just sufficient to mention what the original function does. ,None,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 2:54 pm -04:00,There is a mistake in the semiperimeter function description in the lecture summary material (link).Return the perimeter of a triangle with sides oflength side1 side2 and side3.It should be corrected as:Return the semiperimeter of a triangle with sides oflength side1 side2 and side3.as written correctly in the video lecture.Edit: I noticed this when some one recently raised a question related to this., Unresolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 6:44 am -04:00,Oksana Dylova execution of the above code dont even reach the print statement (last line) because of the error raised by the above statement. So is the answer.Try it in the visualizer (here)., Resolved,2
Tuesday September 24th 2013 6:46 am -04:00,Yeah its true that it can be done easily and shortly as you pointed. The instructor just picked an example to demonstrate the concept. It doesnt mean that it can not be done in any other way.PS: Few examples from other video lectures (for ex nested loops) can also be done easily (without the need of inner/nested loop)., Unresolved,1
