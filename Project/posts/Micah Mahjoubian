Friday September 27th 2013 9:45 am -04:00,I think using IDLE while working through the exercises has been a big help in increasing my understanding of the coding we are learning. Here is what I do. I work through the problem in each question and choose the answers I think are correct. Then I test them out in IDLE. If I am correct I feel that satisfaction you mention in getting it right. If I get an error I look back at the code and try to figure out what I did wrong. I always wind up learning something new or coming to a better understanding of the code when this happens. So I really appreciate this method of learning and feel I have benefited from it. ,None,1
