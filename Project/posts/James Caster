Monday September 30th 2013 1:52 pm -04:00,Thanks for the way you have designed this course.  One thing I would like to clarify... Once we start taking the final what happens when the 3 hours has expired?  Is there any warning to let us know that we need to submit or are we expected to watch the clock and submit at least a couple of minutes before our 3 hours is up?  Thanks for your response and all your help, Resolved,0
