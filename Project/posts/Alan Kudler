Saturday August 31st 2013 2:49 pm -04:00,Has anyone used Pythonista to complete the assignment? I tried but wound up using IDLE on my desktop.  The problem is the handling of files with ios.  It seems that the file can not be opened  in Pythonista so I copied and pasted.  But I dont know how to submit my answer since that requires a file.  Also there is no run module so that to test the examples I had to print   the function and then run the script.Here is another solution for tablets users:There is a new app called Parallels Access which will let you run your computer and all its applications from the ipad.  However you need  wifi and it costs $80 a year., Unresolved,0
