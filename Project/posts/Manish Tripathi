Friday August 30th 2013 5:28 pm -04:00,Hi I think there is a bug with the grader. I got the following results in feedback:GroupAllPassFailErrorWarningViewstudent4135600Detailstudent: test_get_hours.TestGetHours.test_example_from_handoutFAILUREstudent: test_get_hours.TestGetHours.test_seconds_just_after_hourFAILUREstudent: test_get_hours.TestGetHours.test_seconds_just_before_hourFAILUREstudent: test_get_minutes.TestGetMinutes.test_example_from_handoutFAILUREstudent: test_get_minutes.TestGetMinutes.test_just_after_minuteFAILUREstudent: test_get_minutes.TestGetMinutes.test_just_before_minuteFAILURETotalSo according to the above it says that 6 cases were failure. If I look at the top failure case above test_get_hours.TestGetHours.test_example_from_handout I understand that the function get_hours when tested for the example given in handout i.e >>> get_hours(3800)1is not giving the right result for my function and hence it is a failure. But I do see that my get_hour function gives the exact same 1 as the output as given in the handout. Then why is that a Failure? Similarly for other above Failure cases. I have checked each function individually for the handout case and other cases and it gives the same result as shown in handout example but still the grader says Failure. Please explain4135600, Resolved,1

Friday September 20th 2013 9:12 am -04:00,Charles and Jo-AnnDo not worry.  I understand that the deadline is nearing and you might be getting frustrated by this but keep calm and you will get the ans. I will try my best to guide you in the right direction without revealing the answer. Just read and try to understand. Most important. Keep CALM!!The question wants to find the second occurrence of s2 in s1. So this is a two step process;1). Since the question very clearly tells you to find the SECOND occurence of s2 so you know now that you have to ignore the first occurence and go from there in your search. So first find the index of the first occurrence of s2 in s1. 2). Now once you find the position of first occurrence of s2 in s1 now you know you have to start your search from that location to the end of s1 to find the second occurence of s2 in the remaining s1. Just find the occurrence of s2 in s1 but not from location 0 but from the location where s2 first occurred in s1. In order to do that you have an optional argument to find function where you can specify the location from where to start the search. Just specify that and you are done. Note: The question has given very clear hints. It says you would have to use two find function calls. Now since I have broken down the problem in two steps you can figure out where all the find function call is going to be used. The first find function call will give you the location of first occurrence of s2 in s1. The second find function call will use that location and find s2 in s1 again starting from location+1. You would have to use two arguments for find function to do the second step. The second argument would come from first step. Hope that helps! , Unresolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 9:01 am -04:00,Can you send us your code expression to check?, Resolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 9:20 am -04:00,You are not posting the answer as your code expression is not correct. So that doesnt qualify to be an answer. And as Anonymous said you dont need int as the result of find function is an int by itself. find(...)    S.find(sub[ start[ end]]) -> int        Return the lowest index in S where substring sub is found    such that sub is contained within S[start:end].  Optional    arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.        Return -1 on failure., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 8:53 am -04:00,@StaffFor Question 11 0.25 is wrongly deducted for one of the option. This is the question:# data_file refers to a file open for reading.for line in data_file:    print(line)The program above prints the lines of the file but adds an extra blank line after each line. Select the code fragment(s) that when used as replacement(s) for print(line) will print the lines without extra blank lines. The question doesnt say that we have to remove newline character. All it asks is to select the code fragment which will print the lines WITHOUT the extra blank lines. So print(line.strip()) option also does the same and it doesnt print an extra blank line. I understand that it will remove extra blank spaces too but then please look at the question. It doesnt say NOT to remove blank spaces. All it asks is the output with no extra blank lines. So please correct this and add back the remaining 1/4 marks to my final total. , Resolved,2
Thursday September 26th 2013 10:02 am -04:00,I completely understand that. But please look at the question. It is not said we dont have to remove the leading or trailing blanks. It says select the option which does not add any EXTRA blank lines. So even this option gives the same result and should be considered as per the wordings of the question. Else the question should have been specific about not removing any blanks space in a line. , Resolved,-1
Thursday October 3rd 2013 6:11 am -04:00,@RosaIn order to find help for any function you need to first check which object is that method part of. So if you want to find help for strip()function you need to check in which object this function is. For that do dir(object) and it will show you the methods defined in that object. For ex.dir(str) gives this :>>> dir(str)[__add__ __class__ __contains__ __delattr__ __dir__ __doc__ __eq__ __format__ __ge__ __getattribute__ __getitem__ __getnewargs__ __gt__ __hash__ __init__ __iter__ __le__ __len__ __lt__ __mod__ __mul__ __ne__ __new__ __reduce__ __reduce_ex__ __repr__ __rmod__ __rmul__ __setattr__ __sizeof__ __str__ __subclasshook__ capitalize casefold center count encode endswith expandtabs find format format_map index isalnum isalpha isdecimal isdigit isidentifier islower isnumeric isprintable isspace istitle isupper join ljust lower lstrip maketrans partition replace rfind rindex rjust rpartition rsplit rstrip split splitlines startswith strip swapcase title translate upper zfill]You will see strip() defined in this object. So that means strip() can be used with strings. Now in order to find syntax for a method in an object do this in python shell:help(object.method)For ex.help(str.strip) will give syntax of strip() funtion help(str.strip)Help on method_descriptor:strip(...)    S.strip([chars]) -> str        Return a copy of the string S with leading and trailing    whitespace removed.    If chars is given and not None remove characters in chars instead.Hope that helps!, Resolved,4

Monday September 30th 2013 10:44 am -04:00,Hi Now that we all have watched and probably completed the week 6 assignment about files  I wanted to have some education on how do we access the variable values in a file using the variable names. So my question is this:If I have a file with four variables and the following example data. ID Name Marks Rank1  Tom   76       32   Dick   95      23   Harry  97     1Now instead of accessing the data values of each variable above by first removing the first line(Variable Name) using fob.readline() method and then iterating the remaining line using a for loop I want to use the variable name present in the file to access the values for that variable. Like in SAS or other statistical tool if I use the variable name in a SAS Data Step we can access the values of that variable for each observation. So is it possible to access values of a variable using the variable name? Like ID[0]  ID[1] etc or anything similar can give us each observation value in that variable? This actually helps as in a file with many variables we might want to use a variable name to access the data values in that file in case we are running any algorithm on that data. , Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 11:24 am -04:00,I am getting your point. But the dictionary would look something like a key (variable name) with associated value(List of all the observation for a variable. Ex. Dict={ID:[123]Name:[TomDickHarry]Marks:[.......} and so on. The point is this would help me access the list (all observations of a variable) by using dict[key][index of list] but I am thinking is there a way where we can directly access each observation in the file by just using the variable name instead of having to create a dict from all the observations first. If the data file is big then that would be a time consuming thing. Is there any lib or feature using which I can directly access the variable name in a file and get he corresponding observation values of that variable? Thanks, Unresolved,0
