Monday September 30th 2013 2:09 am -04:00,Hi davidI must have spent 4hr on trying to get these last functions: read_words and read_board. I am able to get read_word to work on IDLE but when I submit ...I get errors.I have no idea how to attack read-boards even with your notes above.So more explicit help will be much appreciated.Currently my test score is around 29/37.I have no clue how the tinker program works and how it gets input from this read_words.BTW I define following before the line of def read_words subroutine:words_file=wordlist1.txtand inside def read_words(words_file):wfile=open(words_file r)then I readlines into a list and remove  characters...eventually it does return the correct list without  characters.BUT it does not pass the test.And as I said i was trying similar for read_boardon IDLE I get[ EFJAJCOWSS SDGKSRFDFF ASRJDUSKLK HEANDNDJWA ANSDNCNEOP PMSNFHHEJE JEPQLYNXDL]but again when I submit I get errors on these programs.Please help., Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 3:38 pm -04:00,Thanks a lot for your response...I now succeeded in passing read_words and read_board and now close to finish line with 36/37. Now I am failing update_score which I had passed earlier and it passes on IDLE all the time....so I am not sure what broke here. My code does produce:update_score([Jonathan 4] ANtttt)[Jonathan 10]which is correct....and it is very simple to code also.Is problem set talking multiple player_info as a table with many entries or just for one person at a time?Thanks again for your help..., Unresolved,0
