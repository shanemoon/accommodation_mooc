Wednesday August 21st 2013 6:14 pm -04:00,HiI trying to use my ipad to play lectures so i can have my Mac with python open for IDLE save confusion of jumping through Windows etc.Lecture videos work on ipad but having a problem. Six times so far and cant get to end of first proper lecture! Python as a calculator lecture when i get to third quiz it just seems to hang or freeze on answer nothing happens. So i try pressing play again and the video restarts again from the start and seem unable to scroll with the scrollbar at all. Â I have watch Jennifer go through the first half the lecture 6 times now it wont get past the third quiz section. First two quiz sections work flawlessly.Whats up with it and why scrollbar not work to fast forward? REally want to get stuck in.., Unresolved,0
