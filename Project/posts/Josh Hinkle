Thursday August 22nd 2013 9:10 pm -04:00,I just downloaded the course today and have already finished the first weeks exercise and it was great so thanks for that. My problem  is that I want to save my functions but every time I open a new window IDLE crashes!! Any ideas? Im on a mac 10.6.8 and followed all the instructions... everything else is working fine. , Unresolved,0
