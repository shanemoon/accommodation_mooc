Sunday September 1st 2013 11:34 am -04:00,your explains may be comprehended clearly but still what Im worng I think I had sticky head for this. :(I could give for you my code examples. All fuction what I had it do like this.Code example1)def time_from_utc(utc_offset time):     (number float) -> float    Return UTC time in time zone utc_offset.    >>> time_from_utc(+0 12.0)    12.0    >>> time_from_utc(+1 12.0)    13.0    >>> time_from_utc(-1 12.0)    11.0    >>> time_from_utc(+6 6.0)    12.0    >>> time_from_utc(-7 6.0)    23.0    >>> time_from_utc(-1 0.0)    23.0    >>> time_from_utc(-1 23.0)    22.0    >>> time_from_utc(+1 23.0)    0.0         return float((time + (utc_offset%24)) % 24)2)def hours_difference(time_1 time_2):     (number number) -> float    Return the number of hours later that a time in seconds    time_2 is than a time in seconds time_1.            >>> hours_difference(1800.0 3600.0)    0.5    >>> hours_difference(3600.0 1800.0)    -0.5    >>> hours_difference(1800.0 2160.0)    0.1    >>> hours_difference(1800.0 1800.0)    0.0        return float ((time_2 / 3600) - (time_1 / 3600))like this., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 12:05 pm -04:00,Thx for answer. But still problem of this. I erase all (my solution) but still got same answer. I revise what you suggest that def time_from_utc(utc_offset time):     (number float) -> float    Return UTC time in time zone utc_offset.    >>> time_from_utc(+0 12.0)    12.0    >>> time_from_utc(+1 12.0)    13.0    >>> time_from_utc(-1 12.0)    11.0    >>> time_from_utc(+6 6.0)    12.0    >>> time_from_utc(-7 6.0)    23.0    >>> time_from_utc(-1 0.0)    23.0    >>> time_from_utc(-1 23.0)    22.0    >>> time_from_utc(+1 23.0)    0.0         returnlike this But still same error heres more example like this.Im really hard to understand this Why Id not submit...But I cant understand why erase the solution.ex1)here hour_difference fuctiondef hours_difference(time_1 time_2):     (number number) -> float    Return the number of hours later that a time in seconds    time_2 is than a time in seconds time_1.            >>> hours_difference(1800.0 3600.0)    0.5    >>> hours_difference(3600.0 1800.0)    -0.5    >>> hours_difference(1800.0 2160.0)    0.1    >>> hours_difference(1800.0 1800.0)    0.0        return float ((time_2 / 3600) - (time_1 / 3600)) # I alreay submit - remove solution nor with solution nither.ex2) Also this is one of step 5.Make the fucntion. def get_hours(seconds):	    (int) -> int             >>> get_hours(3800)    1        return int(seconds / 3600) # I alreay submit - remove solution nor with solution nither this. too.ha .. what am I wrong? Its nearly 2::00am in my countries Im really annoying for kind of this problemsPlease give some tips!!, Unresolved,0
