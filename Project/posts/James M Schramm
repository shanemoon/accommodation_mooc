Wednesday August 21st 2013 12:05 pm -04:00,Thats a very interesting question and one that theres a lot of debate on.  I think as a programmer the amount of math required above and beyond a firm grasp of college level algebra and perhaps Calculus 1 is dependent on what kind of programming you do.  I.E. Statistics for actuarial or big data type applications or trigonometry and linear algebra (and maybe physics) if you want to design or work in 3D graphics and game design. Whats more important in my experience is the ability to logically determine how to solve a problem and be able to translate that into code.  Critical thinking and problem solving are key.  You can always research a tricky bit of math if you determine you need it to solve a programming problem.,None,6
Wednesday August 21st 2013 12:23 pm -04:00,I work in the cyber security field and Python and Perl are the go-to languages for writing quick-and-dirty routines for parsing large amounts of data (IDS logs firewall logs etc) or writing filter rules in Linux based firewalls.  In fact some systems with special requirements wont even allow the installation of the Java runtime environment.  Youre pretty much limited to interpreted scripting languages.  C# fails on some levels where the system is an open standard (Linux Apache etc.) and youre not in a MS/.Net environment. Ive had more than one case where another engineer comes into your office and just asks Perl or Python? when they are looking for someone to write a bit of code.  I wanted to be able to say Python (as opposed to just C# and Java),None,1
Wednesday August 21st 2013 3:36 pm -04:00,I used to code quite a bit in C# or Java.  For what I do now there is a lot of demand for Python. Id like to be one if the go-to guys in my office for Python.,None,1
