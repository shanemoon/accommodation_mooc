Friday August 30th 2013 10:05 pm -04:00,Ramon    I may be able to help you but first I need to understand where you are at. In my mind steps 3 and 4 are the same and if youre on step 4 I assume youve properly completed step 3? What do you feel makes step 3 different from step 4? If you will post the code you have produced for steps 3 and 4 I may be able to help., Unresolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 8:21 pm -04:00,The final assignment error I am receiving is Calling the open built-in is not permitted.If I understand this error correctly I am not to use open in reading the files (the error is flagged on the read_words and read_board functions).What I cant seem to do or find access to in the video lectures is find an alternative way to use .readline or .read or to use the for/while loop(the four methods defined in the Reading Files video). All of these methods seem to require accessing the file via open. So where can I look to find the procedure I am supposed to use in this submission aka one that does not require the use of built-ins like open?, Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 8:26 pm -04:00,When I use them directly as in file_name.readline (without the open sequence from the videos) it causes an error of type AttributeError: str object has no attribute readlines. Which I believe means that python is taking the file name that I am inputing with the function and python is registering it as a string instead of the file name., Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 9:02 pm -04:00,When I enter the file name it is of type string. Thus python treats my file name as a string. How do I get python to recognize that I am referencing an open file and not simply a string?, Resolved,0
