Monday August 19th 2013 3:12 am -04:00,Yeah same question I have also heard that 2x is better than the 3x though i havent done python before but my friend is a python expert and he recommends 2x. I would like to put up the same question. Why are we learning python 3x instead of 2x?Thanks, Resolved,0
