Wednesday September 4th 2013 1:40 am -04:00,Hi I am reading some other Python tutorial and it asks me to use OS X Terminal to run Python. I can see using that I am running Python 2.6.1 while IDLE is running Python 3.3.2. I am very new to programing so I am not quite sure what the difference is between IDLE and OS X Terminal. Is it just a different compiler? What practical difference does it make? Thanks for any comments!,None,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 7:54 pm -04:00,Thank you all for the information. This is extremely helpful. Indeed I was able to run all of my .py programs written in this course so far using my terminal by python or python3. I am starting to get a bit more understanding on whats going on here. Thanks again!!!,None,0
