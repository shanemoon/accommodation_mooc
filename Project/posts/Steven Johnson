Monday August 19th 2013 6:10 am -04:00,HiI have a question I hope someone can help me with.I have an R installation that uses the Apple-supplied Tcl/Tk framework. If I install the framework from Active will that interfere with my R installation?, Unresolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 3:08 pm -04:00,ThanksDoes any one else have any experience with running parallel frameworks? As I mentioned in another thread Ive had some problems in the past with third-party frameworks and would like to hear about other experiences., Unresolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 12:26 pm -04:00,HiIm not sure I understand the necessity of installing a full development environment on our machines. Given that we have access to a web-based terminal to run code why not use a development editor (e.g. TextWrangler for Mac)? Such tools highlight syntax and errors and help with learning the syntax and debugging code before it is run., Resolved,1

Monday August 19th 2013 1:16 pm -04:00,HiActive has a Python package that is free for educational purposes. Ive looked into it but still have my doubts concerning installing another Tk framework in parallel to the one supplied by Apple. You might want to take a look at it; a friend of mine who does a lot of Python development uses this.Hope this helps., Resolved,1
Monday August 19th 2013 2:30 pm -04:00,Dear Mr. GhavalasI wonder whether you could answer a question I posted in another thread but to which I have received no answer.I have had several bad experiences over the years of installing third-party frameworks on computers. I installed R several weeks ago and it uses the Apple-supplied Tcl/Tk framework (8.5.9 running on OS 10.8.3). I am wondering whether installing the Active Tk framework in parallel with the Apple-supplied framework will adversely affect my current R installation.I really dont want to run in circles chasing faults between R and Python simply because of a framework issue. I dont feel comfortable installing the Active framework until I get some advice on this.Thank you, Resolved,0
