Thursday September 5th 2013 1:56 pm -04:00,I am embarrassed to admit that I too was totally frustrated by inconsistent results.  Turns out I didnt understand you were supposed to submit the a1.py file with the code filled in.  I kept  submitting individual files (like get_hours.py) and I think the answering computer got confused.  Anyway once I did it right I eventually aced it.  Dont give up!, Unresolved,0
