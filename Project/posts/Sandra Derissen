Tuesday August 27th 2013 8:55 am -04:00,hi theresorry for my bold question i dont have much programming experiences but I dont get the idea and difference between the python shell and a file and when do I have to use which one?, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 11:06 am -04:00,Many thanks Michael! Ok so I define something and store it in a file and can recall it in the shell? Get it. And how does the shell know that I am referring to the definition I stored in a file if I have more than one file? How do I know which definitions are active? All I ever defined? Or are they deleted with every Restart?Again many thanks!, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 1:36 pm -04:00,Ok thank you! One last question (or at least I think it will be the last on this topic): Do I have to define the file I like to refere to when I am working in the shell? Or does the shell know which file I am using when running the module? , Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 3:39 pm -04:00,Thank you very much for this detailed decription! I understand this much better now but unfortunately I am still stuck. I did what you decribed but my code always reachs only the fist list of the board and just returns N instead on NS. I tried with slicing but only get errors and I tried to add row(column_line) a second time (then I get NN of course:)) and much more and now I am quite lost...Â Any hints?Thanks a lot!, Unresolved,0
