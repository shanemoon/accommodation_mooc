Wednesday September 11th 2013 2:44 pm -04:00,Below is a very incorrect sample of code that produces the average number of innings pitched per game for a baseball pitcher. I had a short and simple solution that just takes into account innings_pitched / games_pitched but that presupposes that you have the data already added up or wish to add it up on your own.Im trying to create code that uses the input innings_pitched for each game to give a number that is then added to the existing sum of innings pitched and also produce +1 for the existing number of games pitched.This way one input say 5.33 (Shorthand for 5 1/3) would add 5.33 to the sum total of innings_pitched and +1 to the number of games_pitched.innings_pitched = 0games_pitched =0def innings_pitched_per_nine(innings1 innings2 innings3):        (number number number) -> float    A function that calculates how many innings on average a     starting pitcher pitches    innings_pitched_per_nine(5 3.33 7.66)    5        return (innings1 + innings2 + innings3)/games_pitched,None,0
