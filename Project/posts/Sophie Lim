Saturday August 24th 2013 7:44 am -04:00,Chantelle I have a similar problem running on a Lenovo Thinkpad. My problem was that I had an older version of Python pre-installed in C:\IBMTOOLS. A solution is given on this page: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7509579/python-idle-wont-start?rq=1That seems to work for some people but after making the changes recommended on that page I still cannot access IDLE by clicking on the IDLE shortcut in my start menu. So I went into the folder where I installed Python:C:\Python33\Lib\idlelib\idle.pyI believe there is actually more than one file in this folder that can open IDLE (idle.bat or PyShell) but idle.py is the one that works for me. On my machine the IDLE window opens as Tk Python 3.3.2 Shell. It looks different from the IDLE window you see in the videos because the instructors are using Mac and the way IDLE behaves in Mac appears a bit different from Windows.
