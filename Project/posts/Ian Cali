Saturday September 7th 2013 7:06 pm -04:00,Ive taken all of the in-lecture quizzes along the way doing well on some and not on others but it only gives me the Quiz Attempted Badge sometimes...why is this? do we get penalized for not having that Quiz Attempted badge on each video?On a separate note I keep getting a TypeError on the semiperimeter function... Ive saved it multiple times and made sure its typed in correctly (it is) and I still get the TypeError... HELP! Ive been trying to get past this for the last week and dont want to lose credit!, Unresolved,0
