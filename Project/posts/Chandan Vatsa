Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:09 pm -04:00,I was watching the Variables video.The professor explained very beautifully how variables point to values stored in python.But I want to know where these values are actually stored?Are all the possible realisable values stored in a memory which come bundled with python program (i dont think so) OR the values are automatically generated when requested.It might sound a bit silly but its little confusing. A little help would be great.Thanks, Resolved,1
