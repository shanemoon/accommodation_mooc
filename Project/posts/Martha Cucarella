Tuesday August 27th 2013 10:59 am -04:00,I agree if there is a function defined already the use of hours % 24 is redundant and to me the assignment  points to the practice of calling an existing function., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 10:52 am -04:00,In this question is useful to take in account an example in the handout  : >>>123 %10023The use of % is not the only way of writing these codes but it is the easiest., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 1:40 pm -04:00,yes for hours one uses // but for minutes  either we subtract the time used as hours (before //) or use % the same for seconds subtract the time used as hours and minutes or use %. , Resolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 10:29 am -04:00,If you still have problems from the shell open a new window with just one of the codes for example def seconds_difference(time_1 time_2):    (float float) -> float    Return the number of seconds later that a time in seconds    time_2 is than a time in seconds time_1.            >>> seconds_difference(1800.0 3600.0)    1800.0    >>> seconds_difference(3600.0 1800.0)    -1800.0    >>> seconds_difference(1800.0 2160.0)    360.0    >>> seconds_difference(1800.0 1800.0)    0.0    # write your code hereafter this run this code with a different name for example test and see if it works. In this way you can test each code separately making sure you dont ha an error in a1., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 3:29 pm -04:00,I think book_count is mentioned on purpose but maybe not If you think something is wrong with the code you should not check it as correct since not checking a code is a valid answer meaning no., Resolved,0

Saturday September 7th 2013 10:11 am -04:00,Was the double typing  mistake? If not I dont understand.This seems to me only a problem if the right  digit was in the second place. I agree though that if the right answer is 4e.g. 45 should be marked as wrong but I guess that the automarker  in this case is assuming no student would put anything bigger than 9., Unresolved,0

Thursday September 12th 2013 5:51 pm -04:00,for an expression like s.lower() or s.upper() or s.isdigit() to say True or False it would have to say s.islower() or s.isupper() or s.isdigit() but it would be useless in saying if it is entirely alphabetic or entirely numeric anyway., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 18th 2013 7:50 pm -04:00,Remember that when you put b=a you are really aliasing a and b any change in one is reflected in the other if you put b[1] = AB it means a[1] = AB and later the a[1][0] refers to the firs element in a[1] then a[1] changes to this first element., Resolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 11:19 am -04:00,You have it a[1] = ‘AB’[0]  the [0] indicates the firs item which in this case is A if it were a[1] = AB[1] the it would be the second that is  B.When you put this A in a position [1] you have a =  [1 ‘A’ 3] the B is no longer there., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 10:45 am -04:00,You only need too read the file when testing your code in IDLE the code itself assumes it has been read so dont open it again. You need to start a word list and add each word remember to remove each new line in the process., Unresolved,0
