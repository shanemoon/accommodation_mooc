Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:42 am -04:00,Nick usually you would be right about the real world. However my boss in spite of these courses not being for credit notices what courses I take on Coursera the grades I make and   whether I get a certificate with distinction or not. Not only do I have to keep my skills current it is specifically written into my employment contact that I stay enrolled  in Coursera courses. While taking a  Coursera course  recently the deadline for the final exam was near in one of my class I  was told to do the final exam in the Coursera course then I could return to work. I am permitted  to take Coursera courses for fun  as  well but  my work schedule has been  heavy lately.Twyla HallFocusing  on Teaching (FOT) Chief Technical Officer,None,0
