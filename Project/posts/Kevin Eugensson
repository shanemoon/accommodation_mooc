Tuesday August 27th 2013 9:04 pm -04:00,Idea in basic language is that say if two numbers a & b have the same modulo 24 value then either a = b + m*24... or b = a + m*24 where m is the multiple of 24 that is required to make up the equality.In your example 25 & 1 have the modulo 24 value of 1... & sure enough as expected: 1 + 24 = 25.Now consider -1... it will have a modulo 24 value of 23... as if you added 24 to -1 youd get 23.You stop @ 23 as clearly adding another 24 will create a new problem.Finally consider -134 for example just keep adding 24s to it til you get to 10 & check that in python. , Resolved,2
Sunday September 1st 2013 8:37 pm -04:00,Hey Thanks so much people!! I think I get it now its just to make things quicker and easier so we dont need to write the same stuff again and again..Yes. ..instead we use one function to get different answers to the same problems! Yay!!Not sure about that. I think youd be better off just thinking of it as using functions youve written already (for quickness & ease) to do work for you in bigger (& more complicated) functions that you will create later on.& yes there is also the advantage that if you wish to alter some action that your program performs repeatedly for whatever reason* it is a lot easier to alter that action if its defined in one place as a function (& has been re-used many times)... *instances of such a change might be you decide to make your calculations more precise so use four decimal places for a constant rather than two or switch language (say English to German) or add on languages to your programs print outputs or in the example Grant Peter gave above you might be better off thinking of having a function that would make you a lot of money by printing the value in US $ of everything that is in a shop in the UK that has everything priced in £.def my_function(x):     print(US $ price is: )     print(x*dollar_to_pound_rate) #dollar_to_pound_rate defined outside this function.& how you could easily update that by bringing in a Euro price rate to make even more money:def my_function(x):     print(US $ price is: )     print(x*dollar_to_pound_rate) #dollar_to_pound_rate defined outside this function.     print(Euro price is: )     print(x*euro_to_pound_rate) #euro_to_pound_rate defined outside this function.If some (admittedly fairly primitive) e-commerce or accounting system did rely on your function for calculating $ & Euro prices calculating for 1000s or 1000000s of items you could easily update my_function compared to trying to change so many individual instances of $ or Euro price calculation.I think Ill leave it there., Resolved,1

Monday September 9th 2013 6:33 am -04:00,These kinds of issues that you seem to be having are common enough for people trying to learn programming especially the understood it last week dont understand it now experience & the emotional reaction to that. So feel good that all this trouble will be worth it in the end. =D.Now my own brief explanation of a return statement: all functions are either called directly by you or by other functions. If called directly by you it will return a value (which can in fact rather weirdly be None... think of None as none of the other return values out there) to you. Yet how do you directly call a function? For us its effectively always on IDLE so what is returned to you is returned to you on the next line of IDLE & the way IDLE displays that return on the next line of IDLE is by printing it... unless whats being returned is None which doesnt get printed.If a function is not directly called by you (most wont be you will find as you write more programs) it must have been called by another function... so function_1 calls function_2... & so function_2 when it completes must return to function_1 (just as if it was returning to you directly as if you had called it). What function_2 returns to function_1 is what is that return value.Now function_1 will have been written by you (or someone else) to expect certain kinds of things to be returned & not others... the kind of thing is what we talk about when we talk about type. If function_1 calls function_2 to read the temperature off your local newspapers website function_1 will expect function_2 to return a number most likely a float. If function_1 is actually adding that temperature onto all the other temperatures of the past month to work out an average temperature over the past month then you can see why function_1 will face problems if function_2 returns sunny instead of a number.When we are talking about return values we are essentially talking about considering how to make sure that no function_1 expecting a number from function_2 gets sunny instead... A function can amazingly return another function... but I will only talk about that if you tell me that youve found any of the above helpful.I hope it helps Im not sure it will but I hope it does., Resolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 9:26 am -04:00,OK I see now that it DOES run in the visualizer however it doesnt (& I feel shouldnt due to the nature of the Python language (but I may be wrong on this but I dont think I am)) in IDLE... nor when I just run a Python shell from a terminal.Perhaps the visualizer is more forgiving than it should be.Update: I see now what is happening if you run a file with this 2nd sample the fact that the indentation is not kept with the line print(hello) means that you have essentially ended your function definition then simply told Python to print the world hello & then set the value of a variable to that of the return value of sum(13).So the failure to  maintain indentation will effectively tell Python that youve ended a function definition.

Wednesday September 11th 2013 9:31 pm -04:00,Im just guessing here but... is it a DNA sequence if there isnt a minimum of one of A T C or G in it?Does that help?An example: a sequence of team results is a sequence of unbeaten results if there are only Wins & Draws in the sequence. However there must be one result or more in order to test whether the sequence is one of unbeaten results or not., Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 5:54 am -04:00,Amazingly it turns out that its the other way around as in: the sequence is only false if there is a character in it other than A G C & T.I recall when I did this course this was a point of contention. Id forgotten about that..., Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 7:03 am -04:00,This is just an example of when someones knowledge of a domain raises issues/questions that someone else would not see.Raising questions/issues about code of a syntactic or semantic nature is valued by a lot of programmers especially where there actually is a point to be made. , Resolved,1
Thursday September 12th 2013 7:28 am -04:00,Its just not in some peoples nature to say nothing when faced with a possible error.Obviously when I did the course I re-read the instructions saw what was meant muttered something under my breath that expressed surprise (if I recall correctly) & did/undid the necessary/unnecessary. Id recommend others do something similar if they find themselves in the same position as I was..However I would never say that people should put aside their background knowledge or stay silent when they see what may be an error of semantics in specification etc.I think that part of my point that I didnt state explicitly is that clearly one can raise the issue  (or this kind of issue) precisely because one has an understanding of what their definition (i.e the Professors the clients etc.) of something is., Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 7:08 am -04:00,True (with a capital T) not true. Does that help?Ive hidden your code from others as Im fairly sure the second one is working & Ive told you how to get the first one to run too... so honor code & all that., Resolved,1
Thursday September 12th 2013 8:20 am -04:00,Vignesh I dont know... your code ran for me on IDLE with the minor alteration of the true in each of the two cases. If the autotester says that its ok yet IDLE says no... try restarting IDLE if the problem persists think about a re-installation. You dont need some glitch in IDLE that takes a lot of effort to track down.. especially while doing this course.Congratulations on your autotester success., Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 5:44 am -04:00,Bruno I think you have a point... Another way is to use a Boolean variable that represents whether or not you have found a non-nucleotide character; it would start off as True and would be set to False if you found something that wasnt an A T C or G.(here we read that the boolean is representing some kind of divide/toggle versus representing some kind of find..)or:Another way is to use a Boolean variable that changes if you have found a non-nucleotide character; it would start off as True and would be set to False if you found something that wasnt an A T C or G.I think these would be a little clearer (or present less difficulty). , Resolved,2

Monday September 16th 2013 7:20 pm -04:00,OK give your get_complement code a closer look. Your fragment shown above doesnt add stuff to collect_nucleotide it just keeps assigning new values to it... or maybe assigning squat as you seem to get  as a final value of collect_nucleotide which was your initial value.& be careful about Honor Code Violation., Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 4:08 am -04:00,It is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with file objects. This has the advantage that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes even if an exception is raised on the way. It is also much shorter than writing equivalent try-finally blocks:>>> with open(workfile r) as f:...     read_data = f.read()>>> f.closedTruefrom: http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html, Unresolved,2
