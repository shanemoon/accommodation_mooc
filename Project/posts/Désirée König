Monday September 2nd 2013 2:33 am -04:00,It can also be because the correction is a bit behind. A lot of people are submitting at the moment and yesterday there was a queue for correction of a few hours. If your step 2 works you can continue the assignment and in a a while you should get your feedback., Unresolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 2:41 am -04:00,Like José I think it depends. For someone who already knows programming well it may take 30 minutes.For me although I have programmed before it took 2 hours. And for a complete beginner it may take longer., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 2:29 am -04:00,HelloI think the problem is the following: in the instruction they said that we want to bring the hours back to 24 hours. For example if one day and sixteen hours have past we do not want to count the 24 hours of the day but only the sixteen hours more. In order to do that the assignment indicates that you can use the function  to_24_hour_clock.Good luck, Resolved,2
Wednesday September 4th 2013 11:28 am -04:00,HelloDoes python have the logical operator xor? (may also be called something else).This operator would give these results:True xor True --> FalseTrue xor False --> TrueFalse xor True --> TrueFalse xor False --> FalseThanks a lot, Resolved,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 2:19 pm -04:00,I use a machine at work that is linked to a computer and if there is a problem with the machine an error message appears on the screen of the computer. However that machine (and the computer) are in another building than my office. I would like to write a program that relays the error message to my office computer or cell phone or some other device. However I have no idea yet how I am supposed to do that. I will probably need to do some more courses in order to be able to do that.,None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 7:30 am -04:00,Thanks a lot Hector for your advice. I will have a look at all of this and give it a try. We will see whether I am able to do this.,None,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 1:11 pm -04:00,Hi there!So I went to the Websites and looked at it and I was starting to think about how to programm/tell the computer to send e-mails and so on. But I discovered a bit of a (big) problem. The computer linked to my machine has no Internet access... And I am not allowed to install an Internet access because there is data on there that is considered sensitive by some. And as the machine does not belong to me I cant do anything. By the way the data is simply medical research data not access codes to a nuclear facilty...Too bad it would have made my life easier...,None,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 12:31 pm -04:00,I would change    (str str) -> int      to      (listlist) -> int  .But I guess that this is not necessary for the function to work because it is in the description. Am I right here?, Unresolved,1
Friday October 4th 2013 2:02 pm -04:00,Thank you so much Jen and Paul! This course was great and very clear. It got me even more interested in programming and I am planning on continuing on this way.Many thanks also to the TAs who answered our questions.I wish you all the best. Maybe we will meet in another course.Greetings, Unresolved,0
