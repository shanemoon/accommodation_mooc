Friday August 30th 2013 12:44 am -04:00,The problem summary:The scoring table at the bottom of the assignment submission has headers but they are in white text. This makes it difficult to understand what the numbers in the table represent. Steps to reproduce:It is an issue in Chrome and Firefox.Screenshot:How it normally looksWhen I highlighted the box and uncovered text in the box:, Unresolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 10:09 am -04:00,This post is a bug report about the table header being written in white text that is unreadable across browsers.  It was not meant to be a discussion of if it was right or not.  It is most likely coded in the css for the page and the problem is it makes the text basically invisible.  This post is meant to be a call to action to fix that issue. @Tadeusz Zwijacz you are experiencing the issue I was having by not being able to see the table headers. The columns are not points per question but rather a break down of how you scored overall. When highlighted you will see that the first column is titled group and the next column is ALL.  All indicates the total number of points possible.  Next is Pass.  This indicates the umber of points the acquired by answering the questions correctly (or coding correctly) . Next is the Fail column and that is questions that your code fails to return accurate results.  After that is Error and that is code that you have written that returns errors.  The next to last column is for Warnings and I dont know what that means but I assume its code that you wrote that returns some type of warning which must be different from an Error.  The final column is view and it contains the link to the reporting details.If you would like to see how you scored on each section you need to click on detail and see how your functions performed.  , Unresolved,1

Friday August 30th 2013 5:32 pm -04:00,I tried putting your code:if __name__ == __main__:    import doctest    doctest.testmod()at the bottom of my a1.py file as directed and nothing happened after I saved and ran the module.I then cut the code from my 1a.py file and resaved and reran module.  I then pasted the code into the prompt and hit enter 2 or 3 times and got:TestResults(failed=0 attempted=36)I assume this means it ran the 36 example codes that are with in the doctest?  (I assume there are 36...  I have not counted.)Is this what is to be expected from this snippet of code?, Unresolved,0
