Thursday August 29th 2013 9:51 am -04:00,You can use it to find out if a number is even or odd ie:def parity(number):    if number % 2:        print(number is odd.)    else:        print(number is even.), Resolved,1
Thursday August 29th 2013 10:00 am -04:00,Take a read at the Instructions: http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/programming1/a1/a1.htmlAt the end of Step 2 you will see a link to the Assignments page: https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/assignment/indexUnder the table heading Last Submission you can see the time and date for your submission. Next to that Youll see two buttons: View and Submit.Click in View and youll see the feedback for your assignment.Important note: You can only submit your assignment once every hour (as pointed in the Instructions), Unresolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 10:31 am -04:00,Under that youll see: Show Summary Mid-Summaries Failed AllIf you click in All you can see an expaned table with tests for each function as I understand...In example for this line:student: test_get_hours.TestGetHours.test_example_from_handout{{group}} -> student{{priority}} -> not displayed{{test_module_name}} -> test_get_hours{{test_class_name}} -> TestGetHours{{test_method_name}} -> test_example_from_handoutSo if you click Summary you will see student as a grouping structure for table. If you click All you will see what I had just recently posted. If you click Mid-summary you will see under the grouping student the list of functions (same name as {{test_module_name}}) you had edited/created in a1.pyHope I was clear regards!, Unresolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 8:20 am -04:00,Hello Masen.You have 3 integer numbers as function parameters and you should return a float number.As I see youre mixing the print() function use with a recursive call to the function to_float_hours.BTW if you read the Instructions they say: Print statements: dont use themSo you should try to find a way to incorporate those int / float numbers into an only one float number to return., Resolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 6:46 pm -04:00,You may have a problem with indentation.print(new_message)is inside the else: statement. Thats the reason why you have Happy 3 and Happy 30 printed and not only one Happy 30th![ADDED]As in shell you cant use the whole sentence in one call you should execute the for loop then print.The resulting Shell view will look like:>>> message = Happy 29th!>>> new_message = >>> for char in message:    if not char.isdigit():        new_message = new_message + char    else:        new_message = new_message + str((int(char) + 1) % 10)>>> print new_messageHappy 30th!, Resolved,2
Thursday September 12th 2013 5:32 pm -04:00,Maybe if you use the debugger you will see it better.Lets try to do it step by step. Think first that you need to processs the whole string... and the string is not a generic one is a string that has a message and a number within (an age) that has to increase in one because a new year has past.There are better ways to split this up take the number increment in one and then concatenate the whole string use regular expressions etc. But what this exercise try to solve the problem with the tools we had learned til now and solves only for a number that ends in 9 because will increase in one each number that finds. If you had 23 the result will be: Happy 34th!Lets get back to the step-by-step:# This will allow you to host in the variable char each character of the string messagefor char in message:    # Here you just add to new_message the character that isnt a number    # if you use another method like say .isalpha() you will get a false for the character !    if not char.isdigit():        # So char value is H and new_message is  if you sum both        # you will get  + H == H        new_message = new_message + char     else:        # if char is a digit (ie: 0 1 2 ... 9)        # Lets split this a bit               # This is casting you convert the 2 string to a number 2        # and convert 9 to 9        str_to_integer = int(char)        # Lets add 1 so we get the next number        # 2 + 1 == 3        # 9 + 1 == 10        new_integer = str_to_integer + 1         # Now lets get the rest of the division of new_integer by 10        # if you divide 3 by 10 your rest will be 3;        # if you divide 10 by 10 your rest will be 0.        rest_of_division = new_integer % 10        # Finally if you want to concatenate a number with a string you need to cast it to string        integer_to_str = str(rest_of_division)        # And you concatenate it with the new_message string        new_message = new_message + integer_to_string# And the big finale... when you get out of the for loop (when you reach the end of the string)# You get nothing... until you print out what is in new_messageprint(new_message) Hope that helped you a bit...

Wednesday September 11th 2013 10:54 pm -04:00,Zack modulo will return you the rest for the divison between two numbers.Try to run this:>>> for base10_number in range(11):	mod_by_10 = base10_number % 10	print(%i %% 10 == %i % (base10_number mod_by_10))As you can see it will always return an integer of length 1 wich is a neat way to count from 0 to 9.So you can jump from 9 to 10... then 19 to 20... then 29 to 30... and so on.Sure there will be someone who can explain this better but I hope it can help you a bit., Resolved,1
