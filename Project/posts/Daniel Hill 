Monday September 2nd 2013 10:57 pm -04:00,Hi I know most of you would be attempting week 3 but I have a quick question. Finally finished assignment 1. My code works (as I returned the same values in the qs) but I got a score of 23 (resubmitted twice and same thing). Are peeps having the same issue?? Not sure if I should move ahead or not......, Unresolved,0
