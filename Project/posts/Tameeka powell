Wednesday September 11th 2013 1:03 am -04:00,I would have to agree I have been doing good so far in this course and up until now I am stuck on assignment 1 for the past couple of days and cant get the grasp of what I am being asked to do. Yes I am a novice at this and since this is a programming fundamentals course Im not sure why there is such a big gap in relating the class material from week one to week two. Baby steps guys baby steps some of us are brand spanking new to this. I want to learn but it sucks not being able to get through this assignment. Here is my code below for step 2 please for the love of God I need help lol:def seconds_difference(time_1 time_2):     (number number) -> number        Return the number of seconds later that a time in seconds    time_2 is than a time in seconds time_1.            >>> seconds_difference(1800.0 3600.0)    1800.0    >>> seconds_difference(3600.0 1800.0)    -1800.0    >>> seconds_difference(1800.0 2160.0)    360.0    >>> seconds_difference(1800.0 1800.0)    0.0        return seconds_difference(time_1 - time_2) >>> seconds_difference(3600.0 - 1800.0)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#2> line 1 in <module>    seconds_difference(3600.0 - 1800.0)TypeError: seconds_difference() missing 1 required positional argument: time_2, Unresolved,0
