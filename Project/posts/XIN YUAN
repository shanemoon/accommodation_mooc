Sunday August 25th 2013 10:56 pm -04:00,Hello LakkaThanks for the tip. I actually realize that besides the cap must be off the short-cut only works in IDLE. I was in Python.exe directly and the short-cut didnt work. I just saw IDLE in my Start list. I opened IDLE and tried the short-cut. It works! , Resolved,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 9:09 pm -04:00,I calculated 4^2; so since 4 doesnt equal to 2 Python should give me 1 but the result is 6. How to explain this?Thank you!, Resolved,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 10:47 pm -04:00,aha I might get the idea now. Here is my understanding. Feel free to correct me if this is not the correct understanding: Since the first bit of 4 is 1 while the first bit of 2 is  0  ^  results 1 in the position of first bit. Then it begin to compare the second bit which is 0 vs 1 resulting 1 again. The last bit comparison is 0 vs 0 and the result is 0.  So the final results is 110. Then 110 is converted into 6 as a binary number., Resolved,1
