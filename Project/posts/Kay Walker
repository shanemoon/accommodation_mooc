Thursday September 5th 2013 9:28 pm -04:00,I agree that the video with all the different windows and things named call stack etc did NOT help. Id just like to learn the basic commands:a) what types of variables (as I know them) can be used in the functions b) what order to do things in (eg. how does the program execute things inside brackets?) c) what does the look of the program have to do with anything eg. the indents [I thought I left them back in Fortran days...] andd) if you can run your program in the window you are writing in or if you have to copy it and move it or highlight/select it first? Then I might be able to start manipulating the code to accomplish tasks!!,None,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 12:35 am -04:00,Hi I cant even make the first example work for Assignment 1! I am wondering why I get SyntaxError: return outside function  from this code:def seconds_difference(time_1 time_2):    (number number) -> number    seconds_difference= (time_1 - time_2)    Return the numberof seconds later that a time in seconds    time_2 is than atime in seconds time_1.     >>>seconds_difference(1800.0 3600.0)    1800.0    >>>seconds_difference(3600.0 1800.0)    -1800.0    >>>seconds_difference(1800.0 2160.0)    360.0    >>>seconds_difference(1800.0 1800.0)    0.0        >>> seconds_difference(3600 1800)<function seconds_difference at 0x02D2AB70>>>> return seconds_difference(3600 1800)SyntaxError: return outside functionObviously Ive put something in the wrong place or left something out but I cant for the life of me see where! Helpful hints please!, Unresolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 12:00 am -04:00,Phew! I think I finally got the idea! I was trying to run my return statement on its own without the whole definition before it. I was also putting the final  in the wrong place and most significantly I needed to write ONLY a simple arithmetical statement as the thing to return such as     return float(time_x - time_y)/100.To run the code I just needed to press enter enough times to get the triple prompt >>> and then enter something like>>> get_time_diff(4300 2300)Woohoo!! Now to enter the code exactly as the Python3 expects it to complete all the steps of Assignment 1!!, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 8:34 pm -04:00,I was ready to give up but my motto is have a go and keep trying so I failed over and over. So far I have got 0 marks for the assignment when I submit but I am still trying new ideas so keep me company! I was tricked by things such as:1. Forgetting to put the : after my def statement2. Not indenting when I should.3. Indenting when I shouldnt.4. Putting the incorrect number of things in the brackets ie. the wrong number of arguments for the def function eg. putting in hours only when I meant to enter hours minutes and seconds.5. Forgetting to convert the final times into the 24 hour clock format.6. Indenting the wrong number of spaces! I Did 6 when I should have done 4 or 3 when it should have been 4.7. The Visualiser at least helped me correct the previous 6 errors when I only got Syntax Error or return outside function.There must be more things wrong I havent discovered yet but I am near the end Im sure! So keep trying!, Resolved,4
