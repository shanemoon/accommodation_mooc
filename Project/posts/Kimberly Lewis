Friday August 23rd 2013 5:28 pm -04:00,The textbook that Luke is getting his additional exercises from is a purchased textbook written by our esteemed professors :) I believe it is $25.00 US to purchase the electronic (PDF) copy., Resolved,1
Friday August 23rd 2013 5:30 pm -04:00,Luke Im sure this is not how the textbook (which I dont have) would want us to do it... but I found a solution using an if statement as well as elif and else...Because this is the end of the week and this is not for credit.. I will go ahead and post what I came up with...def best_score(grade1 grade2 grade3 grade4):    low = min(grade1 grade2 grade3 grade4)        if grade1 <= low:        return int(grade2 + grade3 + grade4) / 3    elif grade2 <= low:        return int(grade1 + grade3 + grade4) / 3    elif grade3 <= low:        return int(grade1 + grade2 + grade4) / 3    else:        return int(grade1 + grade2 + grade3) / 3, Resolved,2
