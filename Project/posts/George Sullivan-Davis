Monday September 2nd 2013 6:43 pm -04:00,In 2nd the paragraph beginning with To execute an if statement includes this phrase: skip the rest open 3he if statement.  Perhaps it should state skip the rest of the if statement instead.Also a suggestion: since the videos type contract is(number number) -> strit would be more consistent for the example in the PDF to mirror it instead of displaying the type contract as(float float) -> str. , Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 5:29 am -04:00,I agree with Zachary & Erick! This was the first time I had a chance to witness a professional programmer narrate his process.

Thanks Paul not just for great content but also for having enough self confidence to show us your thought/action process and your vulnerability., Unresolved,7
