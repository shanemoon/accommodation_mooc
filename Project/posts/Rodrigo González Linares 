Sunday September 15th 2013 8:18 pm -04:00,Hi I dont really know whats wrong with my code for gething the lenght of the DNA However when I run the program an error occur. Thanks!def get_length(dna):     (str) -> int    Return the length of the DNA sequence dna.    >>> get_length(ATCGAT)    6    >>> get_length(ATCG)    4            num_lenght = 0    for char in dna:        if char in ACGT:            num_lenght = num_lenght + 1    return num_lenght, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 8:30 pm -04:00,Thanks. OK I changed my code with len() still this message appear:Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#0> line 1 in <module>    get_lenght(ATCGAT)NameError: name get_lenght is not defined, Unresolved,0

Monday September 16th 2013 6:42 pm -04:00,Does someone knows what Im doing wrong. I cant figure it out. Perhaps I shold convert the str to an int or something like that. some idea to set me on the right way?WITH THIS PIECE OF CODE:def is_longer(dna1 dna2):           (str str) -> bool    Return True if and only if DNA sequence dna1 is longer than DNA sequence    dna2.    >>> is_longer(ATCG AT)    True    >>> is_longer(ATCG ATCGGA)    False        if dna1 > dna2:        return True    else:        return False I GET FOR EXAMPLE THIS RESULT:is_longer(AGTCGTCAGTGTCGTCAGTGTAC GTC)FalseWHEN IT HAS TO BE TRUE.WITH THIS PIECE OF CODE:def contains_sequence(dna1 dna2):           (str str) -> bool    Return True if and only if DNA sequence dna2 occurs in the DNA sequence    dna1.    >>> contains_sequence(ATCGGC GG)    True    >>> contains_sequence(ATCGGC GT)    False        for dna2 in dna1:        return True    else:        return FalseI GET FOR EXAMPLE THIS RESULTS:>>> contains_sequence(AGTCGTCAGTGTCGTCAGTGTAC AGT)True>>> contains_sequence(AGTCGTCAGTGTCGTCAGTGTAC AAAAGGGTTTCGTCGT)TrueTHE FIRST ONE SHOLD BE TRUE SO THATS GOOD HOWEVER THE SECONDONE SHOULD BE FALSE., Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 6:56 pm -04:00,ok Im going to try these aproches thanks , Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 7:02 pm -04:00,Problem solved thanks to both. , Resolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 3:19 pm -04:00,Whats your code? You have to use an  in operator so as an if and an else. So if dna2 is in dna1 the function return True else return a False. , Resolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 4:49 pm -04:00,Yep no problem. It would be good if you could copy and paste that part of your code to check it out and have a better understanding about the problem so we can see what is wrong and put you on the right way. It will probably be a very little mistake. , Resolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 5:37 pm -04:00,No problem :) , Resolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 5:21 pm -04:00,Is all good except for the for it should be an if. I have it with an if and works just fine. , Resolved,0
