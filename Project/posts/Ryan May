Anybody care to meet up at a cafe during or after Week 2 for a brainstorming idea-sharing or sit-quietly-with-your-headphones-in-while-doing-classwork-with-the-satisfaction-of-knowing-that-people-around-you-are-working-on-the-same-thing-if-you-have-a-question session? Id personally prefer either of the first two but I know the final option may be the more Seattle choice. :-3,None,0
