Saturday September 21st 2013 1:34 pm -04:00,Hi!Ive managed to create a code with a loop that identifies ATCG letters in dna correctly. It will still return True for an empty string and for a string with lowercase letters. What to add to the code (and where to add it!) to solve these two problems?Thank you., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 2:13 pm -04:00,Thats exactly how my code works for theÂ ATCG issue but can one talk about capital letters and empty strings in terms of a set of characters? It seemes to me we should use a function. Tried to compare the string to s.uppercase for example buy it didnt worl out., Unresolved,0
