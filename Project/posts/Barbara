Monday September 30th 2013 8:57 am -04:00,Hi thereNot too sure whether this is the correct forum but I need to get in touch with Jennifer or Paul about the possibility of exercise/assignment extensions? Ive had huge probs with my laptop over the weekend - its slow unresponsive and its affecting the functionality of Python too hence I am unable to complete the exercises in time. Can somebody advise please? Many thanks!, Unresolved,0
