Tuesday September 3rd 2013 9:20 pm -04:00,So Im writing out my get_minutes and Im getting back whole numbers and the correct answer when I pass it 3800. However if I pass in 7200 Im getting back 60 which while still correct should this roll back over to hours or is this acceptable for the assignment?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:39 pm -04:00,Hmm alright I need to rethink this like I said for 7200 Im getting 66 instead of the expected 6. The code seems right I think I just need to rethink the equation. (seconds - 3600) //60, Unresolved,0
