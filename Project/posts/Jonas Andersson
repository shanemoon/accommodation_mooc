Tuesday September 3rd 2013 9:09 pm -04:00,Yes I think the exactly true might have been buried a bit in the question :] Well anyway remember that the OR condition stops being evaluated when an expression is true. OR cannot tell you about the existence of multiple true statements so if you have multiple passed classes OR is done checking as soon as it hits the first true statement.The other statements wont be exactly true because now you have to make an assumption.Â , Unresolved,0
