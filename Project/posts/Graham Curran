Friday September 6th 2013 12:11 pm -04:00,Dont confuse frames with records  (I speak from personal experience) you get a frame for each function and there are multiple records within each frame. You need to count the frames not the records., Unresolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 5:05 pm -04:00,If you step through the visualiser you can see that the definitions of the functions is part of the main procedure. However when those functions are called they open up a new frame in the stack with their own records which are then erased when the function is closed. If a function calls another function then multiple frames are opened. These are what need to be counted for the quiz., Unresolved,5
Saturday September 7th 2013 3:19 am -04:00,Once you understand what a frame is - and many people have been confused judging by some other threads - then if you step through the visualiser the answer is easy. A frame is created for the main procedure and also as each function is called. The frame will be labelled with the function name and contain at least one record. What the questions are trying to show is that some frames are erased and new ones created as the program progresses. , Unresolved,1
Friday September 6th 2013 5:13 pm -04:00,Please dont post code for the answers even if it is incorrect.

Friday September 6th 2013 4:57 pm -04:00,I have done many other Cousera courses and found the quality of the captions to be variable particularly if they were non-American accents. Some courses have helpful students who post updated versions of the captions but obviously that takes some effort and is subject to a delay. It is unfortunate for those who are not native English speakers (or are hearing impaired) and rely on the captions but manually transcribing all the lectures is an intensive task and for a free course it would be a significant overhead. As it is the lecturers their students and administrators and the forum TAs all give their time with no financial reward. These MOOCs have tens of thousands of enrollees  and tailoring the course for the benefit of every individual is not feasible so it is inevitable that some will feel dissatisfied with the product or be unable to keep up with the schedule.I have enrolled in over a dozen courses but have not been able to keep up with all of them owing to real-world obligations. So I persist with some to get the personal satisfaction of the certificate but with others I download all the course materials to enjoy in my own time and for my own self-education.

With multiple chances to submit answers you could randomly guess the answers and get them all right by a process of elimination. If you want to get the certificate then 19/20 would actually be an adequate score so you dont need to resubmit (so long as you can maintain the same level in subsequent quizzes). I did the Camera Never Lies course and not only did you not get any feedback on which questions you got wrong but you were marked down for questions that you got wrong.Oh and by the way I experienced the same thing but looked upon the resubmission as part of the learning process.,None,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 5:02 pm -04:00,In some programming languages there is a case or switch-case statement which allows you choose different outcomes for multiple criteria without resorting to lots of ifs.

However they will not count towards the grade points required for a certificate of completion. I havent verified it but if this is the only thing you have missed then you should still be able to get a certificate of completion with the final exam exercises and other assignments.

So I download the course material to review at a later date. Most courses still have the quizzes available so that I can test myself even though I know that the results will not count towards a grade.  I accept that I wont get a certificate of completion but the certificates are really not that important; my main aim is to learn.  If I wanted a qualification then I would need to enrol in a course with a much more rigorous examination process. Your bachelors qualification is obviously much more important than this beginners course.  I expect this course will be offered again next year so if the certificate is so important then why not just do the quizzes and assignments next year?

Monday September 23rd 2013 3:38 am -04:00,What is required is that you enter 2 DNA strings and an insertion point. The first string is arbitrarily split somewhere so you just need to slice from the beginning up to the insertion point add the second string and then add the remainder of the first string - which is basically another slice from the same point to the end. The code is effectively just two slices and then concatenating three strings. , Unresolved,3
Monday September 23rd 2013 10:56 am -04:00,Read the assignment again. One of the arguments to the function is the position at which the second string is inserted in the first string. It can be the beginning the end or any point in between the two. What you need to do is write the code for two slices. One from the beginning of the string to the insertion point and another from the insertion point to the end. You can use defaults for the beginning and end (dont bother with determining the string length). , Unresolved,3
Monday September 23rd 2013 10:45 am -04:00,Your code should be independent of the string length. If you dont give a value for the first or last part of the slice it defaults to the start and the end of the string.

Monday September 23rd 2013 3:00 pm -04:00,This is my tenth (or so) Coursera course and I see that this is a perennial problem for people who do not have the same reliability of internet and electricity that we take for granted in much of the west. Im afraid that I cant offer much hope for you as the whole Coursera model is based on having an Internet connection. If you want get a certificate then you need to ensure that you complete all the exercises and assignments in good time. It is actually feasible to get the certificate of completion even if you dont do the final exam providing that your other course work is of a high enough standard.If you really want/need to complete the final exam then you should take whatever steps possible to ensure that you have the most reliable connection possible or have a backup strategy. So I would suggest that you only attempt the exam at a time of day when you can be relatively confident of a continuous connection perhaps at night when others are asleep or when there is less demand on the local infrastructure. Make sure that you download and save as much as possible of the exam before attempting the questions so that you can work offline if necessary and upload when you regain a connection.  Also dont leave it until the last minute try and plan your time well in advance. I appreciate your concerns but these courses have so many students that making exceptions for a small minority is not fair for the majority. It sounds heartless I know but these courses are free and tailoring them to a minority of students in special circumstances is not a practical proposition.
