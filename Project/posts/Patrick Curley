Monday September 2nd 2013 12:45 am -04:00,I freaked out when I saw the initial number of 57000.  My guess is that the numbers are growing exponentially (although they will not continue to do so).Still 65000 students is a very cool number.  Hi yall!,None,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 12:35 am -04:00,I get the exact answer but note the following from the assignment:Because we leave it up to you to write some expressions your functions may return values that are very slightly different from the examples in our docstrings. As long as they are very close your code will be marked as correct; you dont need to make your code match our expected results exactly.        My read is that you should be close enough but I am not grading. ;), Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 1:31 pm -04:00,Heres a small suggestion that could make things easier for the students.  In Assignment 2 we are told:You can also submit your assignment at this point to see whether youre on the right track: remember you can submit once every hour up until the deadline. If the example calls return the expected results and you pass all the tests when you submit move on to Step 3. Otherwise modify your code and repeat the tests.        When I submitted my assignment it told me I had a score of 13/24 but I didnt know what this meant.  When I went in and looked at the feedback it was not entirely intuitive; the checking was done out of the order used in the handout.  How about a simple statement in the handout line If you see a score of 13/24 at this point it means you have passed all the tests so far.,None,1
Wednesday September 11th 2013 12:53 am -04:00,Konrad in this assignment you are not required to count all the nucleotides.  Look at this example: >>> count_nucleotides(ATCGGC G)    2As you can see there are a total of six nucleotides in the string but the function returns only two; the two that match the second parameter of G.As for your sum up over loops problem look at the handout provided under the for loops over str lecture and particularly the part about Accumulator Pattern: numeric accumulator.  The code in there is very similar to what is required to complete this part of the assignment.On a later part of the assignment (is_valid_sequence) you will need to use elif to test all the letters in the string to see if they are valid.Hope this helps!, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:00 am -04:00,The problem is that if your first letter is ATC or G the program pops right out and returns True without checking any of the other letters.  What I did was set a counter to zero tested each individual character and added one to the counter each time the test came out valid.  Then at the end I checked to see if the counter was equal to the length of the string., Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:29 am -04:00,You dont have to do the last if statement.  See the week three lecture on No if required., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 1:39 am -04:00,Looks like the only issue is that last part about printing being on the same line.  Im assuming that the question for you asked to sum up every third integer from 1234 to 10205?  My question was different., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 5:41 pm -04:00,Then I am checking whether the number is odd or not using the if loop after which I am adding the number to the sum variable and then incrementing the number by 1 and finally printing the sum.Wouldnt it be easier to increment the number by two each time?  Then you wouldnt even have to check to see whether the number is odd., Resolved,2
Wednesday September 18th 2013 5:36 pm -04:00,You start with a list of values which contains 12 and 3. When you tell it to print the first time it runs the function.  Each of the values in the list is incremented by two., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 8:43 pm -04:00,Values starts out as an empty list.  Then for each number from 1-4 (exclusive of the latter number)  you append (add) to the values list the number times 3 so 1*3 2*3 etc.Be sure that you are entering the code in Python; you should quickly see whether this produces the desired result., Unresolved,2
Monday September 30th 2013 9:04 pm -04:00,I also got a zero even though I know a lot of my functions worked fine when I tested them.  Every single one gave me back this error code:Message:ERROR: TabErrorinconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation(./a3.py 169 21 print(line end=)), Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 9:26 pm -04:00,Okay I figured out what my problem was; on line 169 (and once later) I called the print function.  Once I pulled the code for those two problems (read_words and read_board) out I got a 30/37.  Seems a bit stiff to give a zero for two errors which did not affect the majority of the defs., Unresolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 6:11 pm -04:00,I have two main problems with the update score part of this assignment.1. It seems to me that at some point we have to pass in the initial values for this--i.e.:player_info = [Jonathan 4] Are we supposed to put this information in the shell?2. No matter what I do in a3.py I cannot seem to get rid of the initial value of 4 and update it to the new value of 7.  I have tried:player_info.pop()Nothing happens; when I ran the module and did the update_score example then typed player_info into the shell it still shows:[Jonathan 4].  If i type:player_info.pop()into the shell and then player_info into the shell it does get rid of the 4 but thats not going to help my function because it has to be in the a3.py file.I tried things like player_info[1] += word_score(word) but that doesnt change it either.Thanks in advance for any hints/suggestions., Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 9:44 pm -04:00,Okay looks like I got credit for that one.  A bit annoyed that I couldnt test it myself but appreciate your help!, Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 9:56 pm -04:00,This is tough.  You mostly want to copy in the code from board_contains_word_in_row and just change the parts which read row to column.  But your len statement is a little different.  Think about it for a minute; in the examples given your board is not perfectly square; its two rows by four columns.  How can you tell it to check the number of columns rather than the number of rows?, Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 11:57 pm -04:00,Zack you are really close.  Think about indexes (indices) and how long the strings are rather than how many strings there are., Resolved,0
