Thursday August 29th 2013 9:39 pm -04:00,When you attempt a homework again all the answers will be cleared out but you can see what you answered before by clicking on the Show Previous Attempts several lines under the Attempt Homework button.  From that page you can review all of the answers for your previous attempts.  You can open this in a separate window and refer back as you are doing the exercise.Watch out though.  Do not copy directly from the previous answers without reading!  At the very least the choices will appear in random order.  For some classes the questions change when you re-attempt.  This can be anything from giving you different data to use in a calculation to giving you an entirely different question.  , Resolved,1
