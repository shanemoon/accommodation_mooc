In an effort to re-engage in the class I have re- enrolled once more. Any chance of re-engaging in the class and resuming where  left off? Steps to reproduce:Screenshot:, Unresolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 9:46 pm -04:00,Nick thanks I think you are correct I could have used a wrong password at one stage and then when I attempted to rejoin I used another. he problem is now that I dont know what my password I used. I have gone in an changed my password back to what I thought it was originally and now I have this problem. At this stage I am not game enough to try any of my other passwords I use for other matters in case I compound the problem. If the worst comes to worse I will simply carryon  from week 3. I dont really want the marks just the knowledge. ThanksNick, Unresolved,0
