Thursday September 5th 2013 12:38 am -04:00,These if statements are all considered independently of one another. If youre using multiple ifs there could potentially be multiple values returned. For example:    if scheduled_time <= estimated_time:        return on time    if scheduled_time < estimated_time:        return delayed    if estimated_time < scheduled_time:        return early This would return multiple values because it could meet both the criteria of <= and <.If you use elif the program will be terminated upon the first expression that has its criteria met and it will ignore all subsequent expressions.Someone correct me if Im wrong but this was my understanding of it., Resolved,-2
