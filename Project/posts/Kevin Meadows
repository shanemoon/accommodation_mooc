Thursday September 5th 2013 12:33 am -04:00,Would it be okay if I display my code on the forum because I looked up and down throughout my code and I can not find the error. I understand your example ETIENNE and I appreciate you and everybody else helping me. There is no indentation that I see that is out of place. So Im not sure what to do and this sucks because I have the homework done but something little that I really can not see is causing me to have this issue through out my code and throughout my grade for this Assignment. So would it be okay if I gave an example of my code on the forums? And if so can someone or a professor please help?Thank You, Unresolved,-1
Thursday September 5th 2013 10:08 pm -04:00,Thank you for the advice of the Python Visualizer and by using the visualizer I was able to get a grade higher than 0. I got a raw score of 25 and the report said that I had 1 error and 16 failures. When I looked at the feedback I get a lot of AssertionErrors Im not sure what that means but can someone help me?Thank again Everyone, Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 12:14 am -04:00,Hi I have been trying to complete Assignment 2 step 3 part 1 but for some reason none of my codes has been working out for me. I do not get what I want so I tried a code from the video lectures:def count_vowels(s):    num_vowels = 0    for char in s:        if char in aeiouAEIOU:            num_vowels = num_vowels + 1        return num_vowelsSo when I put in def count_vowels(Happy Anniversary) in python I get back zero but your suppose to get five. Im not sure what is going on with my Python System and I think this might be the problem to why I can not finish Assignment 2 step 3 part 1.Please HelpThank You, Resolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 12:52 pm -04:00,Thank You for the help Tom Enos but Im still not getting it. I might be over thinking it by a lot but Im not sure what to do. I have tried the hint given and I tried using the help of Tom Enos and Im still not sure. Is there video lecture that might help me with this problem?  Lastly Is this problem a difficult problem or Im I making this problem difficult ?  , Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 7:32 pm -04:00,Thank you again but what about make_str_from_row( )?  What does that do ? There is no value to make_str_from_row, Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 8:46 pm -04:00,Thanks but what does that make_str_from_column()?  I ask this because I have not seen anything like this so is this part of a previous code in the assignment. If so that might be the reason why my code is not working because Im doing each code individual and then putting them all together., Unresolved,0
