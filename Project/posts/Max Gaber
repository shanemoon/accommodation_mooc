Friday October 4th 2013 2:53 pm -04:00,Thanks a lot for a really nice introductory course. This will help me heaps in making the next step using R.Best Fundamental i learned was your way on creating functions. I always started at the body and worked my way to the description. The other way around makes it by far easier. I you really know what you want it is so easy to write the function body :).Thanks again and have a great weekend everyone!Max, Unresolved,0
