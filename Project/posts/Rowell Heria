Sunday August 18th 2013 10:30 pm -04:00,Hi! Checking in from Sheffield UK. Since finishing the Python track at Codecademy Ive pretty much been hooked. I aim to learn more of Python from this course and to be able to apply it to projects I might do in the future.,None,3

Sunday August 18th 2013 11:32 pm -04:00,When the variable area is created Python will first evaluate the expression on the right of the assignment operator =. Whatever the value stored in the variables will be used. >>> base = 10>>> height = 5>>> area = base * height / 2 #At this point base is 10 while height is 5>>> area25.0>>> base = 15>>> area25.0We still get 25.0 as the variable area only contains that value and not the actual expression base _height / 2. If we want to reflect the changes to area we will have to do area = base * height / 2 again this will take into account the changes we made to the variable base., Resolved,2
