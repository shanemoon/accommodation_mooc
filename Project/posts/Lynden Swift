Wednesday August 21st 2013 4:14 pm -04:00,Wow - I had no idea there was any difference between watching online and downloading! It never occurred to me to watch online to be honest - perhaps I should give it a go then! Thank you for your quick response. Lynden, Resolved,1

Friday August 30th 2013 3:21 am -04:00,I keep getting a syntax error whilst trying to follow along with lesson 3.: input/output. I am guessing it is caused by incorrect spacing? Could someone please give a concise summary of where spaces should and should not be in python statements? alternatively if this is not caused by incorrect spacing - what am I doing wrong?Many thanksLynden , Resolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 4:15 am -04:00,Ok thank you - seems that I was running it in the wrong thing. I will retry this evening using the standard idle editor.  I was trying to copy the lecturer who had already saved it as a py file. Perhaps thats where I got confused. Thanks for your suggestions. , Resolved,0
