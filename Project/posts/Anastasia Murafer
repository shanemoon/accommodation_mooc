Monday August 19th 2013 4:28 am -04:00,I think that being a Programmer is not so much about knowing your Maths or your code; its a way of thinking (thats not to say the former are unimportant). There are plenty of tools and resources to help us with our mathematics IDEs now complete our code for us provide us with suggestions for function calls etc. But what all those tools cannot give us is the way we think the way we approach the problem before us. To be a Programmer you need to be able to correctly identify the problem before you to see it in a structured way and to be able to break it down into logical pieces.,None,7
