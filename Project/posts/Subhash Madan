Wednesday August 28th 2013 9:29 am -04:00,HiWhen I try to run my module containing the following codedef area(base height):         (number number)-> number        Returns the area of a triangle with given base and height.        >>>area(10 40)        200.0        >>>area(3.4 7.5)        12.75            return base*height/2I am getting the following error message...and I cant figure out why?Inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation.Any ideas?, Resolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 9:39 am -04:00,Thanks guys...it is working now. I only had to make a change in the last line of code. I first eliminated the carriage return and then hit the ENTER button to create a new carriage return. I guess it cleared the tabs and spacing issues.Thanks!, Resolved,1
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 9:46 am -04:00,Initially I submitted the wrong file which did not contain a solution so naturally I got zero points. When I realized that I re-submitted the file that contained the solution. This was 10 hours ago but it has not yet been graded. Both files are named a1.py does that make a difference?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:36 am -04:00,I resubmitted about 15 minutes ago but no response as yet that is other than confirming the submission , Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:20 pm -04:00,I have submitted my a code a couple of times. Now all of my code works when I test it but when I submit it it is getting a grade of zero meaning everything is incorrect. I am puzzled as to why. Is anyone else having the same issue?, Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 4th 2013 12:58 am -04:00,Thank you...I dont know how indentation got out of line but I corrected it and re-submitted. It worked.....thank you!, Unresolved,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 11:53 am -04:00,I am using Python version 3.3.2. First the interface looks lot different than what I see in the video lectures. There seems to be no mechanism I can get Python Shell and text editor on the same page/frame side-by-side like in the video lectures. I have to switch screens back and forth which is not very convenient. I am wondering if other people have the same issue or did I do something wrong when I installed the package. Anyone?I am using Windows 8 should that make a difference., Unresolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 12:39 pm -04:00,Thanks I am already doing that but I thought that an IDLE should have that capability., Unresolved,0
