Sunday September 22nd 2013 2:25 am -04:00,Ive checked. At least in my exercises questions Q10 and Q11 are exactly the same with same answer options. Ive answered Q10 right. However my answer for Q11 (when I answered it the same) were graded as wrong.I think it is a problem with the exercises setting. Please fix it. Thank you so much!, Resolved,1
