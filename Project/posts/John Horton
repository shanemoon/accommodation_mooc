Tuesday August 20th 2013 3:25 am -04:00,Hi AnonIts because your answer is correct. As its a multiple choice option each potential answer is awarded a correct/incorrect so if you correctly identified 2 of the functions as not being valid as well as 3 answers which are correct syntax they would all be ticked. Effectively its saying your answer of it not being valid is correct.ThanksJ,None,1
Tuesday August 20th 2013 11:45 am -04:00,Dont forget the operators square and square root!  Youre 12345 reads like division has a higher precedence which it doesnt both division and multiplication are the same they get processed from left to right.  Its just tricky initially getting your head around it! :-)1) Brackets2) Sq and Sq Root3) Division and Multiplication (from left to right)4) Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), Resolved,4
Tuesday August 20th 2013 11:39 am -04:00,Hi VijayI think you may have missed the introduction to the course:This course provides an introduction to computer programming intended for people with no programming experience. It covers the basics of programming in Python including elementary data types.Its not designed to be a replacement for a University Degree but an entry into the wonderful world of programming for someone who is a total beginner.  If youre more advanced than this course then maybe sign up to one of the more complicated courses.  For me whilst I am a competent programmer I choose to hang out here maybe learn a few snippets or gems Id not thought of and maybe offer a couple of pearls of wisdom back if I can help someone else out.No need to be negative I think youve just misunderstood what the goals of this course are and this is still week one!Good luck with your studies!J, Resolved Locked,6
Tuesday August 20th 2013 4:28 pm -04:00,Starting with a number is indeed incorrect. What youre likely looking at is you getting a correct green tick for not selecting the answer as being valid. The system ticks each multiple choice answer which you correctly answered it doesnt mean its a valid syntax just that you correctly identified a wrong answer.,None,2
Monday September 2nd 2013 3:49 am -04:00,If you have already got a function which calculates second differences between 2 numbers then could you not reuse that function but convert to hours in the hours function? , Resolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 3:38 am -04:00,Totally agree I have some experience with programming and for me the reading and understanding of what is being asked and the process takes the longest time.  I like to read several times maybe taking half an hour/hour before I actually embark on the coding. The physical writing of the code doesnt take long once you have your head around the concepts.I think it will take as long as you need and not one minute quicker so if its 8 hours who cares getting it done in the end and learning is the most important part. I think an hour is fantastic but dont benchmark yourself on others everyone is different..., Unresolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 1:25 pm -04:00,In the following question should it not read Select the English sentences(s) that describe the meaning of the expression if the expression evaluates as true?The minimum passing grade is 50 and variables math_grade bio_grade and cs_grade represent a students final grades in three courses.  Select the English sentence(s) that describe the meaning of the expression:(math_grade >= 50 or bio_grade >= 50 or cs_grade >= 50), Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 7:36 am -04:00,I understand that they are not asking for the result but in order for the answer that is correct to be correct the result of the expression has to be true if it were false then another answer would be correct and because it is not stated it is simply just an assumption.Even the hint says or evaluates to True if at least one of the operands is True. so the question should really include that information., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 5:06 pm -04:00,Hi AllOn the last 3 questions you use the python visualizer dont do what I did and click geetings.py as it opens in the actual window not in a new window and when I realised and clicked back....  all my answers were gone and I had to start again I did it twice like a clown :-)To answer this you should use the Python Visualizer for this code: greeting.py, Unresolved,6

Monday September 2nd 2013 5:43 pm -04:00,I had exactly the same struggles I must have watched the lecture 5 times.  Think about it like this if you import the maths module and use it you would be calling maths.function (num) not just function(num) as its not a built in function., Resolved,0

Sunday September 15th 2013 3:32 pm -04:00,Hi thereIve just seen the below message on the homepage re. the removal of the submission delay but its still asking me to wait the hour.  Could someone tell me when it will be updated please or am I missing something?Many thanksJohnLTP1: assignment submission delay                                        Hi allWe have decided to relax the submission delay: you can now submit assignments as often as you like.  However if the load on the server ends up slowing it down significantly we may add a delay.Cheers-Paul and Jen, Unresolved,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 10:05 am -04:00,Hi GuysI really feel for you I almost did the same thing but thankfully noticed before clicking.  Is the solid 3 hour final exam something that happens often on Coursera?  It almost goes against what Ive loved about the course so far i.e. being able to dive in and out when I get a spare half hour or hour.  Sometimes I watch the videos over 3 or 4 days then hit the exercises.  Sometimes I can do it all at once.It would be great to see flexibility in the exam approach for a halfway through stop the clock in case something comes up.  Just to be clear I am not complaining just trying to provide some constructive feedback to a system which seems to flow against the tide of the general principle.CheersJohnny, Resolved,2
