Tuesday August 20th 2013 2:01 pm -04:00,Is it possible to turn on line numbers in IDLE during editing code. Sometimes during running the error message points to the line number. It is ok to deal with small codes. But when it gets large I think an editor with line numbers will help. Suggestions?, Resolved,0
