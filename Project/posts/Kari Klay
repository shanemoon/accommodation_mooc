Saturday August 31st 2013 6:11 pm -04:00,Im also quite confused over this.  I am testing many scenarios especially those listed in the summary/rubric and Im getting correct outputs in my Python shell.  But....only half of the criteria under each function are passing with the other half failing once I submit my work.  Ive been using the handout example for step 5 with each of the get_... functions getting the correct answer in the shell but missing it every time on the assignment summary!  Also testing situations where seconds exceed one days worth seconds on the hour/minute/zero seconds seconds just before/after hours and minutes.  When I view the details of the failed tests they all mention AssertionErrors.  Ive tried Googling what this means but I cant glean any helpful information from search results because I am a true beginner.  Feeling a little discouraged that I cant seem to get the correct marks on the assignment when my shell says all is well.  If anyone can provide a little insight Id greatly appreciate it!alles bestenKari, Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 6:13 pm -04:00,I keep thinking about this from the handout but Im not sure if it is really relevant to my problem.  Floating-point numbers in this handoutThis assignment involves float calculations and as you know these can be inexact. As an example here is code copied from the Python shell:>>> 7 / 30000.0023333333333333335>>> 7 * (1 / 3000)0.002333333333333333Because we leave it up to you to write some expressions your functions may return values that are very slightly different from the examples in our docstrings. As long as they are very close your code will be marked as correct; you dont need to make your code match our expected results exactly., Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 6:17 pm -04:00,YUP!!  Thanks for letting me at least work it all out outside of my head.  My issue is now resolved.  If anyone else is having similar problems I HIGHLY recommend looking at that floating-point numbers bit above and then examining your function body., Resolved,0
