Wednesday October 2nd 2013 2:24 pm -04:00,In a dictionary the order of keys does not matter. To get the mark your code has to be what the autograder wants: so your code may produce the correct result but it will only be marked correct if it in the expected form.  The instructions for this and similar questions try to explain what is wanted and what is not wanted, Resolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 9:11 am -04:00,Yes - but the clock is still running while you are disconnected so you need to reconnect quickly enough.  If you save regularly then your earlier intended answers will still be there; if not then you will need to put them in again.   , Resolved,3
