Wednesday October 2nd 2013 7:30 pm -04:00,When I run my make_str_from_row through the Visualizer it has the return value ANTT (for the given example). So I have not used print or anything. However when I combine it with the make_str_from_row function a part of the function body is skipped it goes to line 35 directly. Which should not happen. But because I return a string by make_str_from_row I am not sure what I am doing wrong. Because of this I am get stuck at num_words. All help much appreciated!  , Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 7:32 pm -04:00,Of course I mean when I combine it with the board_contains_word_in_row function.Please note that board_contains_word_in_row results in True and False as you would expect., Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 8:52 pm -04:00,My functions work and get full credits when I submit them. Until I add num_words_on_board. Then I get this message (in Idle same in the Visualizer):Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#0> line 1 in <module>    num_words_on_board([[A N T T] [X S O B]] [ANT BOX SOB TO])  File /Users/rianne/Documents/accumulatie.py line 165 in num_words_on_board    if board_contains_word(boardwords):  File /Users/rianne/Documents/accumulatie.py line 110 in board_contains_word    return board_contains_word_in_row(board word) or board_contains_word_in_column(boardword)  File /Users/rianne/Documents/accumulatie.py line 73 in board_contains_word_in_row    if word in make_str_from_row(board row_index):TypeError: in <string> requires string as left operand not listWhat I think is that the problem is caused by make_str_from_row(board row_index). I however get a string as return (no printing). I rewrote the code (based on suggestions on the forum) still working fine. I combine it with board_contains_word_in_row it still works as expected. I combine it with board.counting.word (+ column codes) it is still working and then I add the num_words_on_board and then it gives me this error.I do not understand why it works fine first should it not be breaking before as well? Any ideas??? All suggestions are much appreciated!!, Resolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 5:20 am -04:00,Hi TomThanks for your help! I really appreciate it. You were totally right. I was looking at it the wrong way it was num_words_on_board creating the problem. I was indeed referring to a list instead of a word. Adding an index solved the issue.Rianne, Resolved,0
