Wednesday September 25th 2013 11:35 pm -04:00,My board_contains_word_in_column functions works correctly when I try it on my computer but when I submit it it says Method Description:NoneMessage:ERROR: IndexErrorlist index out of rangeIve seen threads where they use (len(board[0])) instead of (len(board[0])-1) but when I do that it gives me an error. The really odd thing is that I use my version of  board_contains_word_in_column in my board_contains_word function and it works perfectly fine both on my computer and when I submit. Could someone please help me out? Im totally stumped by this., Resolved,0

Thursday September 26th 2013 1:54 am -04:00,Interesting...it skips a line.>>> make_str_from_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]  [X S O B] [X S O B]] 3)TBBBYoure right I had some issues because I didnt do that code right. I tried to amend it to (max(len(board[0])len(board))-1) but that doesnt seem to work either., Resolved,0
