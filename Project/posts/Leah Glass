Tuesday September 3rd 2013 4:46 am -04:00,why doesnt print(str(int(age1+age2)))print a string? i get an int. i thought it would have converted 1020 into an int and then back to a str. where is my thinking wrong?many thanks, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 7:50 am -04:00,Thanks guys. Much appreciated.Kevin I think youve refined my question. Why no quote marks?After a quick google search I found the type() operation. >>> age1 = 20>>> age2 = 30>>> print(str(int(age1+age2)))2030>>> x = str(int(age1+age2))>>> print(x)2030>>> type(x)<class str>So youre right it is a string even though it has no quote marks. Weird.Any clues from the course staff would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!, Resolved,1
