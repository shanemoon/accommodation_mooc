Tuesday September 3rd 2013 9:02 pm -04:00,I started this course while on vacation using my sons computer (new windows OS). Now at home Ive tried to install Python (Python 3.3.2 Windows x86 MSI Installer) on my XP machine. It seemed to install properly but IDLE will not start when I click on the shortcut. All I see is the hourglass then nothing. The python command line and manuals shortcuts work ok. Nothing happens when I click on Module Docs. Does this install work on XP?  May I type a command to start IDLE ? Is there a way to troubleshoot may installation to fix this? , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:07 pm -04:00,I just discovered that there is an old installation of Python in a folder called  c:\IBMTools\Python22 created in 2006 on this computer.  This installation does not show up in the Remove programs list. I dont know why it is there but I also see it in the path statement. I get this error:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_tkinter.TclError: Cant find a usable init.tcl in the following directories:    {C:\IBMTOOLS\Python22clcl8.4} C:/IBMTOOLS/Python22/tcl/tcl8.5 C:/Python33/lib/tcl8.5 C:/lib/tcl8.5 C:/lib/tcl8.5 C:/library C:/library C:/tcl8.5.11/library C:/tcl8.5.11/libraryC:/IBMTOOLS/Python22/tcl/tcl8.4/init.tcl: version conflict for package Tcl: have 8.5.11 need exactly 8.4version conflict for package Tcl: have 8.5.11 need exactly 8.4    while executingpackage require -exact Tcl 8.4    (file C:/IBMTOOLS/Python22/tcl/tcl8.4/init.tcl line 19)    invoked from withinsource C:/IBMTOOLS/Python22/tcl/tcl8.4/init.tcl    (uplevel body line 1)    invoked from withinuplevel #0 [list source $tclfile]This probably means that Tcl wasnt installed properly.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------How can I fix this? I think it has to do with the TCL portion of the install. , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:10 pm -04:00,Nick I dont think this is a memory problem.I think I have to uninstall previous versions of Python and TCL on this computer.  I dont know how to uninstall if they dont appear in the remove program list., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:51 pm -04:00,I am worried about removing it because it seems to be part of the computers IBMTools for rapid recovery. I think I should the environment  variables but again I am worried about breaking the recovery tools. Here are the current  environment variables (control panel/system/advanced) which refer to the older Python and which I think I should either modify or remove:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PYTHONCASEOK1PYTHONPATH%SystemDrive%\IBMTOOLS\utils\support;%SystemDrive%\IBMTOOLS\utils\loggerTCL_LIBRARY%SystemDrive%\IBMTOOLS\Python22clcl8.4TK_LIBRARY%SystemDrive%\IBMTOOLS\Python22clk8.4--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Does anyone have suggestions on what I should do?, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:20 pm -04:00,OK thanks to those who posted. I now have the Python shell from clicking on the IDLE shortcut. The only thing I did was to delete all of the system environment variables which referred to the old Python. I checked to see if important programs still worked then tried to open IDLE. It opened and seems to work fine so Im back in the course! , Resolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 9:38 pm -04:00,After deleting old environment variables that pointed to Python22 directories I could run IDLE ok.  Thanks Im closing this thread., Resolved,0
