Monday September 2nd 2013 4:52 pm -04:00,Hi AllIm coming late to the party so this might be an non issue nowbut I also had the installer fail with the same message.First Im using XP Pro...I tried the download from Python.org with X86 and it failed.I went here for another try:http://download.cnet.com/Python/3000-2069_4-10080057.htmlAnd realized that my first attempt was a download to Desktop (my bad)So this might be the key saved the file into C:\Downloads.Ran the installer from that directory.When I got to the Customize Python 3.3.2 dialog I selected to add python.exe to Pathbecause it seemed the right thing to do.Success.So the issue would definitely seem to be permissions and they vary from XP Vista 7 and 8. And some installers cant run from the Desktop...Good luck Jeanette,None,0
