Wednesday August 28th 2013 2:15 am -04:00,Also Id like to add a little tidbit about documentation I learned from one of my co-workers that is a technical writer.  When you read a question rather in a video quiz or assignment. If you see a font style difference thats what you need to pay attention too.  Documentation is done this way to show the difference between just reading what you see like a lecture and getting you to perform an action in the instructions.  , Resolved,1
