Tuesday September 17th 2013 7:22 pm -04:00,Hey thereas far as I understand it - you only need to test a single nucleotide (character) for this function - the next function will do the looping through the string.So if and elif statements will be sufficient and youre only dealing with 1 character!Cheers!, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 7:42 pm -04:00,First you have to make sure you only use if once the other ones need to be elif and the last one can be elseE.g.if nucleotide == A:      return Telif nucleotide == T:     return A。。。else nucleotide == G:     return ....Dont forget the colons~, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 8:14 pm -04:00,It has to be indented by a tab or 4 spaces (usually)A short question - are you using IDLE or something else?elif nucleotide == T:    return (A)Also check the spelling of your parameter and the name you use in the if statemente.g. nucleotide / nucloetide It may be that you have a typo somewhere., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 7:05 pm -04:00,You need to reduce all of the tabs in the main body of the code by one.So the first if needs to be only 1 tab space and then the return statement 1 tab from the if statement.Tip for return statement:Backspace until you hit the ifs : then hit enter and it will automatically place it in the right position., Resolved,0
