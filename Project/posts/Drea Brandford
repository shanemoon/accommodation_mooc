Thursday August 29th 2013 8:13 pm -04:00,A common piece of advice that Ive heard given to programmers is document then code. If you write out what you want your code to do including the expected outcome you are much more likely to write code to the documentation. If you arent clear on what the outcome is supposed to be its easy to start tweaking your code to give you want you think you want rather than the spec given to you.Drea, Unresolved,3
Thursday August 29th 2013 8:09 pm -04:00,I am seeing different helper text for the help function than is displayed in this lecture. When I open the parenthesis after entering help my helper text displays (*args **kwds). But the video shows the text as Define the builtin help.  I get this both when I first start up Python and after loading a module. Is this just due to running on Win7 rather than a Mac?, Unresolved,0
