Since the next digit after 6 is a 8 Python rounds up to the next higher 1/000 i.e. to 3.457, Resolved,8

Monday August 19th 2013 7:17 pm -04:00,Fantastisch! Würde mich freuen wenn wir uns gegenseitig etwas helfen würden bei Fragen und Problemchen :).Ich bin jedenfalls mal an Bord.Warum habt ihr 4 Mädels den Kurs gewählt? Würd mich mal interessieren.Bei mir ist es hauptsächlich deshalb weil ich herausfinden will ob programmieren einen Teil meines zukünftigen Arbeitslebens ausmachen soll oder nicht und weil ich das Trauma das mir ein C++ Pflichtkurs an der Uni beschert hat überwinden will ;),None,0

Friday October 4th 2013 3:14 pm -04:00,hey I think anonymous who opened this thread was asking whether it is possible for the staff to post some statistics on the course AFTER it has ended. Of course it doesnt make sense right now but I was also thinking that it would be interesting to get some nunbers on how many passed etc after the hard deadline. On top of that if you read the post closely again youll see that they just asked whether it is possible to get some hard facts and that they did not ask whether the staff could post numbers NOW. --> no. 1 posting rule: Be nice!, Unresolved,1
Friday October 4th 2013 3:05 pm -04:00,Thank you for this fun learning experience!You helped me to get over a horrible programming experience I had at Uni during my Numerics course.The lectures couldnt have been more structured well explained and perfectly chosen.The amount of work was adequate and the level was appropriate too for total beginners. Not too hard and not too easy in my view. tTHANKS!Monja from Germany, Unresolved,0
