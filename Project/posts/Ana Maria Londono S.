Sunday September 1st 2013 10:44 am -04:00,I was having the same question as SREEJITH but with the explanation of MICHAEL of what do you get i got it. Â when they ask in the question...what value does result refer to?.... i thought they were asking what comes on the screen after you execute it and in this case is 4 but the reality is that the value stored in result after executing it will be none.thanks Michael!!!, Unresolved,1
