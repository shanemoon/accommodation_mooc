Tuesday October 1st 2013 12:46 pm -04:00,Hi I too just discovered this course.Â I realize it is too late to learn all I need and submit all assignments on time and still receive a certificate. However is it all right for me to use the resources on this site to teach myself programming? That was the entire point of my joining - Im not overly concerned with obtaining an SoA or acknowledgement just with developing the skill set., Unresolved,0
