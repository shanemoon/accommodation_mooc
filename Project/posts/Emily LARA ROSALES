Sunday September 1st 2013 9:24 am -04:00,HiI need to leave on Oct. 2nd for a 3weeks trip. Id really like to be able to go to the end of this class doing as much as possible all exercises and assignements + the final exam. Is there any way I could have access to the last weeks lecture videos + exercises + final exam a little before hand so I can submit before I leave? (like last material + final exam on Sept 23rd) Or anyway I could do them when I get back (21st of October) ?Many thanks, Resolved,0
