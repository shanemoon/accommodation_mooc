Tuesday August 27th 2013 12:51 am -04:00,Ive got the passing grade for question 15 but I think the question has an issue:Here what it says:To determine whether the capital of country1 or country2 has a longer name write a one-line expression that calls both get_capital and longer. The passing grading of this function only gives the capital with the longer name. It is up to you to look up the country for that capital afterwards. However the question is really asking whether the capital of country1 or country2 has the longer name. In other words the answer should be either country1 or country2 depending on the length of the names of their capital. One solution (including Python ternery operator in expression)>>> country1 if longer(get_capital(country1) get_capital(country2)) == get_capital(country1) else country2, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 12:50 pm -04:00,Yep that looks like another alternative. Nice one actually. My point is that the question is asking about the country but the accepted solution is producing the capital of that country instead. I think the same problem exists in the video lecture., Resolved,2
Tuesday August 27th 2013 1:31 pm -04:00,I think you are missing the point! I am not discussing the mechanics of this problem. I am discussing about the the currently recognized correct result that does not satisfy the actual question asked.We have to be precise in out wording. The wording of the question asks for the country which has the longer name of the capitals given two countries. The currently accepted correct result of the question only produces the longer capital.You have to take the next step to figure out which country that capital belongs to to answer the actual question asked.BTW you do not have to use if. But you have to do more to arrive at the correct solution to the actual problem. I would be curious how you would do in one expression. Please note that my use of if is as an operator (as opposed to statement). Etienne actually produced another nice way to come up with the correct solution by using and and or so it is still an expression instead of multi-line statement.It would be nice if one of the instructors looked at this thread., Resolved,2
Tuesday August 27th 2013 3:23 pm -04:00,I disagree. The question should be the answer to whether the capital of country1 or country2 has a longer name.If you stop at producing the capital with the longest name you have not answered whether that was the capital of country1 or country2 programatically., Resolved,1
Thursday August 29th 2013 11:12 am -04:00,Thanks. The new wording (below) does clearly indicate that the expression needs to produce a capital.Write a one-line expression that produces the longer of the capitals of country1 andcountry2.The ambiguity is now resolved and I marked this thread as resolved., Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 4:44 pm -04:00,I got this wrong (and only wrong test case) on my first submission.The disagree with the grading system that  is a valid sequence. It fact I went out of my way to incorporate that  would return False. I even documented that as a test case in doc string. I think the test designer has dropped the ball on this.The fact that Assignment was vague on this should make this test case invalid.Here is the proof:If  (string) is a valid sequence than there should not be a problem complementing it.. Then what should be complement of  should be? Huh? Also complement of complement should give itself. Clearly it does not work out that way., Resolved,1
Friday October 4th 2013 5:14 pm -04:00,Actually there is a string method to get length. It just not named obviously.>>> s=abcdef>>> s.__len__()6Basically build in len(obj) calls obj.__len__() method of objects that implements such functionality., Resolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 9:52 pm -04:00,Yes I wrote that utility. You do have good memory. My name is in About dialog that is accessible from system menu. Not many look at there., Resolved,1
Sunday September 15th 2013 5:07 pm -04:00,I am in the same boat and I went ahead out of my way to make the empty string return false. In fact I did document that in my docstring.Now this was my first submission and I can definitely change the function and submit again but I think the grading system test case is wrong in this case. I could have avoided this if I got to the forum first to see what other people like me are complainingabout before submission.Here is the proof that  (empty string) is not a valid sequence:If  is a valid sequence than there should not be a problem complementing it.. Then what should be complement of  should be? Huh? Also complement of complement should give itself. Clearly it does not work out that way., Unresolved,1
Sunday September 15th 2013 8:10 pm -04:00,Here is the proof that zero-length string  should not be considered a valid DNA sequence.For each nucleotides in DNA sequence there is a complementary nucleotide. This relationship is 1-1. So a sequence complemented twice should give itself. This does not work for empty string and therefore empty string should have been considered invalid and thus is_valid_sequence() should return false. Otherwise it is in violation of complement rule.I would very much like the instructors to reconsider this test case. In fact I would really appreciate if an instructor looked at this and posted a response.I am not posting this because I need an extra point. This was the only failed test case for me on my first submission. In fact I went out of my way to incorporate this to the test cases and doc string with the expectation that it is invalid. The Assignment itself made no representation what empty string should be considered but by applying the double inversion logic above it is clearly invalid.  Anyway I had to use second submission to get the full credit but I still (strongly) think my first submission is the actual correct answer to this problem, Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 11:35 am -04:00,My point exactly an empty string has no nucleotide. So it cannot be complemented because complement operation is only defined for actual nucleotides. Why do you assume empty string complements to itself? There is no such definition anywhere., Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 11:55 am -04:00,In this case you are left alone to derive the condition for validness from the problem domain itself. In fact this test encouraged the user to do such determination. For each valid nucleotide defined by the problem domain there is a valid complementary one. The fact that there is no complementary defined by the problem domain subject matter for empty string leads to the easy logic that it is not valid as input to functions that expect a valid nuclotide or valid dna sequence., Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 5:18 pm -04:00,The web site you linked:http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/rev_comp.htmlWhen you leave the form empty you get the error that it cannot be left empty. So it rejects empty as valid input. So it is designed as I claimed it should be.The other one is not saying valid or not. But the fact that the counts of nucleotides are all zero tells me that no valid nucleotide is detected., Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 5:11 pm -04:00,Sorry I am with your wife. When there is no nucleotide there is no DNA sequence to speak off. , Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 5:10 pm -04:00,The fact that it does not contain other characters besides ACGT does not make it valid either. In fact there is no DNA sequence when there are no nucleotides. So when you are talking of a valid DNA sequence there has to be at least one Nucleotides., Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 10:36 pm -04:00,If this a commercial situation I would seek clarification from the customer. If it is another group in the company I would contact the person that write the spec. It matters here because you cannot get clarification in the test situation (unless you happen to dwell into forums and I did not do it) So this is different than your QA situation., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 1:09 am -04:00,Tom Did you miss my response to it? Obviously I did not miss it.The instructor telling me how to resolve an ambiguous case in the forum is not valuable if it is costing point for people. They are not required to check in here before submitting the assignment. It does not matter for me in the end. I had to use my 2nd submission to get full credit. But I see some other people having difficulty with other parts and by the time they resolve their other issues they may not get to this and may not have an extra submission.My expectation for proper resolution of this case:a) Revise the assignment instructions to explicitly state that empty dna sequence is a valid sequence (I disagree but anyhow for exercise sake)b) Or take out this test case from scoringGiven we are late for (a) b is the proper and fair action IMHO.Again I am not asking points for myself., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 2:46 am -04:00,The examples in docstrings can be interpreted by doctest module for automated verification:http://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.htmlhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoctestI think doctest module is not capable of re-routing the supposed user input to actual input statement.

Wednesday September 18th 2013 4:13 pm -04:00,Problem with your script is that it will has a side effect of printing something when used in an expression like the following when we do not intend to print anything on the console.count=0x=last_vowel(pfft)if x == None:    print(No vowels found!)else:    print(Found  x)If there are no vowels it will print:NoneNo vowels found!Clearly the first None is not desirable and is the side effect of your print(None). This way of getting doctest pass is not correct as your function is doing something other than it is supposed to do (undesirable side effect)As for the contract(str) -> str | NoneThis is just a documentation for ourselves. doctest does not interpret that part. It is saying that my function can return a string or None depending on the conditions so the caller is prepared to handle that., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 5:45 pm -04:00,Yeray I disagree that return print(None) is an acceptable alternate way.

Thursday September 19th 2013 9:08 pm -04:00,Barry previous you were doing.grades = grades.append(80)Now just concentrate on the right side of equation: grades.append(80). This does indeed modify the contents of list (side effect) appending 80 but the append method returns None and you are storing that into grades variable. So your code was equivalent to:grades.append(80)grades = NoneIn other words right after list contents were modified you discarded your own reference to the list.Take a look at the help page for list.append() and pay attention to the contract! It does not return the modified list. It returns None (always)>>> help(list.append)Help on method_descriptor:append(...)

Tuesday September 17th 2013 2:21 am -04:00,You typed [ ] instead of ( )not [s[i] in aeiouAEIOU][ ] built a list containing only the evaluated result of expression: s[i] in aeiouAEIOUIn other words the test condition of your while loop evaluates to either not [ True ] or not [ False ] depending on s.Here is what python evaluates those two cases:>>> not [True]False>>> not [False]False>>> So the body of your while never executed. Be careful with details.

Wednesday September 18th 2013 1:15 am -04:00,There is a mathematical solution to this type of problems. According to the story mathematician Gauss came up with a solution when he was at elementary school at 1700s when his teacher gave the class to add numbers 1 through 100 to keep them busy. A few minutes later Gauss came up with an answer. http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/QQ/database/QQ.02.06/jo1.htmlThe solution could be done in a similar way (but this is not the way the problem wants you to solve). I worked this on paper but I am not going to post here because the test only asks for the final number which would account for giving away the answer., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 4:37 pm -04:00,for i in sum(range(...)) is not correct. Toms example is actually computing the number without a loop (at least an obvious one)>>> sum(range(1100))4950This example adds numbers 1 through 99 without a loop.

However the in video quiz is asking is that after going through just one iteration of the for loop what would the list contents would be (as opposed to when the whole function is finished). In other words it is asking you to determine the values in an intermediate step of the program. You can use Python debugger in idle or visualizer. Experienced programmers just visualize these in their mind (or on paper) without the help of visualizer., Unresolved,0

When you open for writing if there is an existing file it is first truncated to 0 length and new data is written. Each write will keep appending to the file at the last write position while it is held open. Once you close and reopen for writing it will be truncated again., Resolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:52 pm -04:00,Python does not attach any meaning to the variable names. We choose names so that they are representative of stuff they hold or refer to. We could easily write:for x in y:This tells Python y is iterable item and go iterate over all values of y assigning a new one to x each time you go through the for loop. If y does not fit this criteria Python will tell you rudely with an error message.But instead of x and y when I type the following I can understand the program better later:for grade in grade_list:    ...So Python does not know anything until the moment of execution. We have arranged things (like making sure y hold a list of grades beforehand) that Python can execute. So there is a bit of planning in programming. Things do not happen out of blue. Thesequence of operations needs to be carefully setup to achieve the desired effect otherwise nothing is going to happen. If you need to process a list of grades you need to read them from somewhere and put in a list. To obtain them from disk you open  a file. Or if you are going to type them in you can use input() function. As a programmmer you either decide on theformat of data files input etc. or someone has decided it for you so you need to figure out their formatting rules and read accordingly and parse accordingly. How you represent things internally is largely upon you unless you are interfacing with someother 3rd party code/module and you are supposed to feed the data to those interfaces the way they expect., Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 2:12 pm -04:00,You are supposed to pass an open (for writing) file (not a string) as the first argument. The second argument is a list of strings that will be written to the file. Basically you are supposed to iterate over the list in second argument and write each string to the file. Precondition says the strings themselves do not contain  so you will have to use a code sequence so that each string appears on  a line by itself in the file.Here is the test code you can use in Idle:>>> sentences = [ line 1 line 2 line 3 ]>>> file = open(tempfile.txt w)>>> write_to_file(file sentences)>>> file.close(), Resolved,4

Wednesday September 25th 2013 2:35 pm -04:00,A board is a list of lists. The outer list contains the individual board rows as sub-lists. Each row of the board i.e the sublist themselves contain the single character items in that row. For exampleboard => [ [ A B ] [ C D ] [ E F ] ]This board has 3 rows and each row has 2 columnsrow0: board[0] => [ A B ]row1: board[1] => [ C D ]row2: board[2] => [ E F ]So your read_board function read a file with contents like the followingABCDEFand build a board (list of lists) within the function and return that board to the caller via a return statement.

Thursday September 26th 2013 12:58 pm -04:00,how to break list [ABCDEF]  into parts of its elements!!!Adarsh:Actually instead of trying to break internal elements try to construct the board list correct first:Looks like you have a loop to read the board rows from file. Now instead of adding the string that you read from file immediately you need to so some work on that line.Lets say you read one line of board from file to a string variable named line.Since board is a list of sublists you need to construct the sublist say named row from lineYou can start with an empty row list.row = Do you remember how to loop over characters of a string using a for loop? Such code is written in many places already.If you can loop over each character in line than adding characters to the row is simple.row.append(c)Once you are done with looping over characters of line you have completed the row and you can append the row sublist to the board in a similar way., Resolved,1
Thursday September 26th 2013 3:42 pm -04:00,for column_index in board[i][column_index]:Please note that you are using column_index for two different purposes. column_index is a parameter to this function that indicates which column you are interested. So board[i][column_index] gives you the character in board row i column column_index. Using column_index as for variable messes up the original value. You need to use a different variable.Please also note that board[i][column_index] in this exercise is supposed to be a single one letter string. So you do not have to iterate over that string to achieve your purpose. Inner loop is not needed., Unresolved,0

Now go fix your incorrect board_contains_word_in_column() function. In your code you have reused parts of the board_contains_word_in_row() function you had so they both iterate over the same index range. Also I suggest you rename the loop variable from row_index to column_index for the one board_contains_word_in_column. If you used the correct name for your loop variable it would have been more natural for you to check the range you are using.Also please edit your posts to remove much of the code for implementations afterwards as you have given away major portion to the others and it is really not acceptable without running into ethics violation., Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 3:21 pm -04:00,**** but when I execute def num_words_on_board(board words): now returns 5 and not 3As Tom indicated you probably have a problem in how you are advancing the count.But why did you not use (call) your board_contain_word_in_row() and board_contains_word_in_column() functions in the implementation of board_contains_word() instead of duplicating code. These functions are already tested so if you use already tested functions as building blocks you have less chances things going wrong and you are more likely to get the things right.BTW you dont execute def nums_words_on_board() but simply execute num_words_on_board(). Execution of def statement is done when you ran the module in Idle or when Python read the module sources into memory. That execution created the function and placed the entry point for num_words_on_board() in a function table. Thats it. When you actually call num_words_on_board() the execution of the body happens. Minor point but I wanted you to understand the difference., Resolved,0

It returns an object to later use for read write etc)Note. If your file is mut.txt instead of just mut you should modify the file_name accordingly. On windows file extensions are by default are hidden. So it is probably not obvious to you if a file has an extension and thus open will fail as file not found.
