Sunday September 1st 2013 4:49 am -04:00,You have to add a parameter for the function to work. In this case the variable word. Your second option is close but you have to replace str with word. Idk if I should be telling but I guess its ok. :D, Resolved,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 7:57 am -04:00,@Anonymous It wants to find the longer of the two capitals. So first you must find the capitals using get_capital. Then the input for the second function longer is the output for the function get_capital. The  output of longer is the result. Additional information (if you know basic calculus):Programming is just like calculus.  Consider the function longer as f(x) where x is the input and consider get_capital as g(x). x is the input. So in calculus we would write this as f(g(x)). We would write the answer to this question in a similar way., Resolved,0
