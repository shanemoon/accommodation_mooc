Thursday August 22nd 2013 10:30 pm -04:00,Hi All  Im trying to define a function in the Python Shell in Linux. The case is that I do not know how to say that I finished writing the function.  For example:>>> def a(x):...     d=d+1   How do it get out of this sub-idle?. I have tried ctrl-c ctrl-d typing exit etc.Thanks in advanced, Resolved,0

Thursday August 29th 2013 9:30 am -04:00,Hi All  I might be wrong but I believe there is a small error in this week evaluation. In question number 3 for week 2. It says:The following is printed by a print function call:[~ep]\color{red}{ext{[~ep]}}  Then you have to select two answers from the given options. One of the options I selected was:[~ep]\color{red}{ext{[~ep]}}  Which I tested in IDLE and it reproduces perfectly the output. However it was marked as wrong the proposed good option given after submitting my answers is:[~ep]\color{red}{ext{[~ep]}}   In my humble opinion the above option is wrong if you test it in the IDLE it do not reproduces the correct output.Am I missing something?ThankAlejandro AcostaP.D. This is the full output of the question (unfortunately the copy/paste is not perfect).Question 3The following is printed by a print function call:[~ep]\color{red}{ext{[~ep]}}Select the function call(s) that prints what is shown above.Your AnswerScoreExplanation[~ep]\color{red}{ext{[~ep]}}[I edited your post to remove answers to the questions. ~ep]\color{red}{ext{[I edited your post to remove answers to the questions. ~ep]}}, Unresolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 9:46 am -04:00,Hi Etienne   Thanks for your answer. I understand the green tick and the red X the case is that a correct answer is evaluated wrong and the proposed answer (with the green tick) is wrong. Im just asking you/the lecturers to check the answers in question 3 for week 2. Thanks  , Unresolved,0
