Tuesday October 1st 2013 2:45 pm -04:00,For sure there are smart people at Coursera who have thought about how to make thing fair for each of the parties in terms of grading;the instructor -to give him/her a way to grade people fairly  according to the knowledge- and the student knowing that mistakes can happened and the grade might not reflect the acquired knowledge.On the other hand  Coursera like any other on-line educational platform is fairly new service and it might take a while to get it close to perfect( if there is such thing!) or at least to have it to the point where both parties mentioned above would consider it good enough. Trial-and-error plus suggestions from community (students) will get all of us to that point and most likely that Coursera will be happy to hear suggestions.Personally I think that the system should offer:1. sample exam just to get  students familiar with how the system works2. by having number 1. they can afford to post harder exams that can be considered like take home exams.    This approach is done everyday across real campuses.3. Exercises and assignments should include questions starting from easy to  difficult. It will allow the grader(or instructor) a way to separate among students based on their work and  why not smartness.My 2 cents ...Cheers to allIonel, Resolved,0
