Tuesday August 20th 2013 5:59 pm -04:00,Short view - technically parameters are the variables in the function and arguments are the values given to the variables at the point of call. So outside the function it is more common to talk about arguments. Inside the function you can really talk about either. When I define say function example like this...def example(xy):In above code  x and y are parameters...?ParametersThat will take on the value of the arguments passed to the function.---------------------And when I call the function and pass it valuesexample(3217)are those values arguments ... I *thought* this is called passing arguments...ArgumentsI actually thought x and y would be referred to as arguments in both cases, Resolved,0
