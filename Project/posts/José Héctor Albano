Thursday September 5th 2013 1:57 am -04:00,Youre right. And as Nick Sarbicki said it could have been more useful to create a group UTC # for immediate responses.I have been answering questions on the forum of Exercises and Assignments. And I learned a lot there.A few minutes ago just out of curiosity for the first time I entered in the forum Study Groups and the most interesting was this post. Why?Im a Spanish speaker so I went to the forum Spanish Study Group. After 17 days it has been created is full of people just joining the group and saying Hello. They have created a group on Facebook :o. In a quick review only in the last 2 days someone asked about the Assignment 1. I hope they are solving problems in their Facebook group.Well thats it Im not going to join any study group :). Oops Im in UTC-3 and already 2:30 am so Im going to sleep.

Monday September 2nd 2013 10:25 am -04:00,You have 3 different functions: get_hours get_minutes and get_seconds. They each receive one parameter: the time in seconds.Remember that a function must be able to receive any value (As long as the preconditions are met) not just the values of the examples. So you dont have to use fixed values like 3800 or 200. You should use fixed values if they are constants values of the problem. You know the constants for this problem:1 minute = 60 seconds1 hour = 60 minutes or 1 hour =  3600 seconds.If you use 67 seconds as argument for the 3 functions you got this:>>> get_hours(67)0>>> get_minutes(67)1>>> get_seconds(67)767 seconds = 1 minute 7 seconds.Depending on the function you will need to use the integer part of the division or the remainder of the division.Bye!, Resolved,0

You cant provide them any data to a function. In more complex functions youll have to validate the data provided to the function.For example a simple precondition for the functions in this assignment could be The parameter must be a number.

If you try get_minutes(452000) withyour formula returns the 7473 minutes instead 33 minutes.Using the previous example in that part of the formula you need to know (in seconds) the minutes remaining (33min) discarding the hours (5h) that fits in that time in seconds.

Friday September 13th 2013 2:20 pm -04:00,First at all you have to understand how work the string.find() function  (your 2nd question). As argument you give it a substring  contained or not in string. If the substring is foundit returns the position (index) where the substring starts. [Additional to the substring you can give it the optional parameters start and end to find the substring between the start index or/and the end index of thestring].For example.s = rock and roll#    0123456789012If you wanna know in what position starts the substring roll s.find(roll) returns 9.If you wanna know in what position starts the substring and from position 2 (index) s.find(and 2) returns 5.Right?To answer your questions:1) Using twice the find function (Read the hint) your code have to find in s1 the position where s2 appears for the 2nd time:For example:s1 = banana#     012345s2 = anaThe string s2 ana appears the first time in the position 1 of s1. The 2nd time s2 appears in the position 3 of s1.3)s1 = rock and roll#     0123456789012s2 = oThe string s2 o appears the first time in the position 1 of s1. The 2nd time s2 appears in the position 10 of s1. I hope this help., Unresolved,3

Theyre used to be called selection structures. They help to select a way an alternative. In this Lecture Summary are the Logical operators.To clarify the difference between them:The elif is connected with the first if or previous elif. Theyre alternatives to if that require that a new condition to be evaluated. They are mutually exclusive to each other. You could add an else statement to run if none of the conditions is met.Example with elif: In this case if condition1 is False condition2 it is evaluated.

Friday September 13th 2013 8:03 pm -04:00,In the lectures is the explanation about how the precedence works. The order of precedence in an expression with or without parentheses just indicates how is evaluated the whole expression. The operator with highest precedence is evaluatedfirst. I think that in the Lecture Summary (information icon ) you can find the tables. Maybe the instructors could add the partial table of order of precedence as Lecture Summary in the end of each week.Until the week 3 we know this (incomplete) table of precedence (extracted by me from the official docs)Table Operator precedence                        Operator                        Precedence                                        ( )            highest                            **                                        - (negation)                                        * / // %                                        + (addition) - (subtraction)                                                                    < <= > >= != ==                                        not                                        and                                        or            lowest            So here an large expression without parentheses first.

Saturday September 14th 2013 5:42 pm -04:00,Youre right. But read this A2 FAQ.

A string is not a valid DNA sequence if it contains lowercase letters.But when we submit the assignment the Autotester give us that error: Our code have to interpret the empty string as a valid DNA sequence.Maybe a clarification should be included in the assignment., Unresolved,5
Saturday September 14th 2013 6:10 pm -04:00,Anne youre close. The solution is simpler. Use this proposed aproach: Another way is to use a Boolean variable that represents whether you have found a non-nucleotide character; it would start off as True and would be set to False if you found something that wasnt an A T C or G.Dont test if potential_dna is alphanumeric or is in uppercase. As you do the if statement combined with in operator test what you write between .  The condition is false if the char is not in the string. Just it.if s in ABCD    # s is in ABCDelse:    # s is not in ABCDs = B -> Trues = b -> Falses = F -> Falses = f -> Falses = C -> Trues = c -> False, Unresolved,1

Sunday September 15th 2013 2:40 pm -04:00,Before a Commuty TA delete your code :). Why do you accumulate nucleotides in your second If statement? If that correct condition is False it means that the nucleotide is invalid and all DNA sequence is invalid so you just can exit of the function there. Because of that your third if statement is not necessary.EDIT: But you still have to return True., Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 3:13 pm -04:00,Your logic is right the code it should work but you are comparing two strings. You have to compare the parameters without the quotes. Delete the quotes.dna1 is not equal to dna1. The first one is a string because the quotes. The second one is a variable or parameter., Resolved,0

Tuesday September 17th 2013 12:11 am -04:00,William try this:is_valid_sequence:The empty string is a valid sequence. So add code to satisfy that condition. There is much debate in the forum on this topic. Dont worry about it. Just do it. If you dont add the code the Autograder complains.So if you call the function with an empty string the function have to return True.get_complement:I just wanna verify what you do here. I assume that you get this:If you call the function with an nucleotide the function returns its complement. Right? One character as parameter and one character returned.get_complementary_sequence:The outer structure is right but  you should use (if it works well) the get_complement function with each nucleotide and accumulate the complement there. One line vs the if-elif structure. This is not to do the code more pretty I read in the forum that the Autograder complains if uou dont reuse the get_complement function. I cant confirm, Resolved,0

Tuesday September 17th 2013 11:39 pm -04:00,In Q10 the two variables a and b point to the same list after the execution of the assignment in the line b = a. After that any change in a or b affects to the same list. So when they are printed they show the same list.In Q11 the two variables a and b point to different lists. So a change in one of them not affect the other one. So for that they show the same values when they are printed must be changed individually.Test it in the Python Visualizer., Unresolved,2
Wednesday September 18th 2013 2:00 am -04:00,Remember from this Lecture Summary that a variable works as if stores a value. But actually a variable stores the memory address otthat value. So a variable points to or refer to a value.In this case a stores the memory address of the list [1 2 3]. When the assignment b = a is executed b stores the memory address stored in a. So b also points to the list [1 23].Copy this code with one of the correct options of the Q10 and paste it in the Python Visualizer to see how it works.a = [1 2 3]b = aa[1] = A     # MISSING CODE HEREprint(a b), Unresolved,4

Tuesday October 1st 2013 9:59 am -04:00,When you define a function you define parameters (if any) too.

These arguments are also called in the bibliography as actual parametersSo in summary in the function definition you call them parameters. In the function call you call them arguments (the actual values), Unresolved,3
