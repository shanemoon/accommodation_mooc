Sunday September 15th 2013 10:02 am -04:00,I submited my assignment 3 times. The 1st time for the step 2 was ok. But with the 2nd and the 3rd time It was problem on auto-grader. I only added code for step 3 and step 4. And auto-grader give me 0 for all. But I did not change any thing in my code for step 2. :(Anyone have problem like that? How to fix it?Thanks, Unresolved,0
