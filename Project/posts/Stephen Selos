Thursday September 5th 2013 2:18 pm -04:00,A terminology FAQ would be great even a glossary.  I would say this is what notes are for :)  I constantly go back to look at what I wrote down the refresh the terms.  Love this course so far for someone with an EE degree this has been very helpful., Resolved,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 2:21 pm -04:00,This course has been great so far very easy to follow and alot better then the intro to C++ I took almost 13 years ago.  Makes me almost want to get into deeper programming :)  Almost.Again thanks for this class its helping be better understand my development teams deliverables.  Coming from a sales / hardware background to working with a sw team is a big change :),None,3

Monday September 30th 2013 12:52 am -04:00,Ill echo whats already said.  the functions are pretty straight forward and you have to interpret the lectures to apply them to the individual functions.  I asked questions in the forums and read them to see what was going on.  Im not a great coder at all only taking C++ in college (EE degree).  I was able to get 37/37.  you just have to take the lectures use the examples they have and work through it.All the information is in the videos and forums., Unresolved,1

Monday September 30th 2013 12:54 am -04:00,Yeah dont give up.  Also do each function one at a time do the examples.  The last couple of functions are challenging but the first couple are straight forward from previous examples.  Remember each function is individual.  Dont get wrapped around the game aspect just treat each function as its own thing., Unresolved,2
