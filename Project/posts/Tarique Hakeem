Saturday September 28th 2013 1:44 am -04:00,Only one week is remaining. I was curious whether the final exam would be like the exercises or the assignments.Regards, Resolved,2
Monday September 23rd 2013 3:05 pm -04:00,>>>>>> I did not understand how it returned the value 2.1. First of all the module is expecting two strings s1 and s2. So there should be some error.2. The if statement should return some error.3. Even if there is a match it is only 2 so num_matches = 1Regards==============================================Imagine we want to modify count_matches (reproduced below) to count the number of matching elements in two lists. For example count_matches([1 2 3] [5 2 3]) should evaluate to 2. Select the option(s) below that would need to be changed in order to make the function do this.def count_matches(s1 s2):     (str str) -> int    Return the number of positions in s1 that contain the same character at the    corresponding position of s2.  Precondition: len(s1) == len(s2)     num_matches = 0    for i in range(len(s1)):        if s1[i] == s2[i]:            num_matches = num_matches + 1    return num_matches, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 1:01 am -04:00,Finally done with read_words(words_file) and read_board(board_file)! It was a learning experience. Many thanks to TA and fellow students who posted hints in this forum.My experience showed that:1. Open the file outside the module and pass through the argument.(Or else the parser will not mark it as correct)2. Output for read_board(board_file) module should be a list of list of individual characters.Best Regards, Unresolved,3
Saturday September 28th 2013 1:51 am -04:00,This is required for the grader program. You may test the module any way you like but at the time of submission make these changes.1. Open the files in python shell(Main window) not the module and pass the open file as the argument words_file or board_file.2. Output for read_board(board_file) module should be like following;[[E F J A J C O W S S] [S D G K S R F D F F] [A S R J 	D U S K L K] [H E A N D N D J W A] [A N S D N C N E O P] [P M S N F H H E J E] [J E P Q L Y N X D L]]I hope it helpedRegards, Unresolved,1
