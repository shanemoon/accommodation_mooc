Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:24 am -04:00,I am using the starter program file and then wrote my function code there and then uploaded it - perhaps that is the problem?I should just write only the code and not use the starter code file?  any suggestions would be helpfulthanks, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 5:42 am -04:00,Thanks for all the responses - it worked this time and this time I downloaded the a1.py file and then wrote the code for each one then ran each of them one by one and then went to the next and then saved and uploaded the file and it worked, Unresolved,1
