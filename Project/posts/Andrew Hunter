Thursday September 12th 2013 1:58 pm -04:00,Unless Im missing something the problem appears to be here (as pointed out in the second reply to this thread):         complementary_sequence =complementary_sequence+get_complement(dna)Thats calling get_complement on the entire string dna.  It seems like it should be:         complementary_sequence = complementary_sequence + get_complement(char), Resolved,1
Thursday September 12th 2013 1:25 pm -04:00,Im just curious about why string methods are not allowed.  It seems like it would allow for more compact and easily-edited code.  For example for get_complement:    if ntide == A or ntide == T:        return AT.replace(ntide )    elif ntide == C or ntide == G:        return CG.replace(ntide )seems easier and more efficient than a series of if/elif statements.  No big deal as it works either way but I wonder why that particular prohibition is there., Unresolved,0
