You write the code and save the file then go back to your regular IDLE shell window and it will look for the code on the other window you dont need to do anything. The IDLE shell knows the window exists in the background as long as you use the Run Module command (I think that was it). I hope that makes sense. , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 12:47 pm -04:00,Just curious is there a way to download the video lectures AND also include the in-line quizzes at the same time? I want to be able to watch and do the quizzes offline on my commute. Thanks!, Resolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 10:12 pm -04:00,THANK YOU! This made perfect sense to me. I got the code to work using just the first position [0] but I couldnt figure out how to make it read the rest of the columns till I read this!, Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 5:26 pm -04:00,Im in the same boat. Im so lost. But as they said we arent allowed to use print in our code. I think Im lost because I still dont get loops AT ALL. And I dont have enough imagination to make up random variables on my own.... Anyone know a good link to understand Python Loops??Ive got as far as getting the A N T T answer but Im having trouble converting it to ANTT instead. , Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 8:13 pm -04:00,Im confused by this.... what is egg carton cracked_egg....how do I know what is a temp variable and what isnt? Thats what I dont understand about writing these things. I dont know where to use the real items that will be provided (i.e. board row_index) or when to make up my own. How do you know when to do what and where to put whatever you make up?? Thats where Im lost..... Im just making up words and putting them places where I think they go but I dont think Im doing it right at all...., Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 8:10 pm -04:00,Can you explain how you get the lecture numbers (6-2 6-4 8-2)?? I dont see that info anywhere and I presume you dont mean week six lecture 2?? Because that was a different topic all together...., Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 9:43 pm -04:00,I figured it out on my end. I had lots of extras in there I didnt need to calculate (i.e. I was using list but didnt really click that its already a list and therefore list wasnt needed). , Unresolved,0
