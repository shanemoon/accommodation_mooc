Saturday October 5th 2013 8:22 am -04:00,similar question:  As I followed along in the video re: asn_to_grade MY python interpreter inserted the A4 key:pair at the front of the list.  I then added an A5 key:pair for grins and that was inserted AFTER A4 and before the original list as follows:{A4: 100 A5: 999 A1: 80 A2: 70 A3: 90}Wha????, Unresolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 5:06 pm -04:00,The problem summary:Prior to submitting make_str_from_row my score was 5/37.  After submission score was 8/37 however make_str_from_row detail was in a separate table below the main result table and showed 3 failures.Just now I submitted make_str_from_column and my NEW score is now 11/37 with the results of make_str_from_column now showing in the separate table below the main table and showing 3 failures.I might add that the results of my test runs on these functions are all correct.Steps to reproduce:complete and submit the first A3 function which is working as required.grader shows  5/37complete and submit the 2nd A3 function which is working as required.grader shows 8/37 Drill down to details2nd function results (only) in a separate table and showing all 3 items as failure.complete and submit the 3rd A3 function which is working as requiredgrader now shows 11/37 with 3rd function results (only) now in a separate table showing all 3 items as failure AND 2nd function results are nowhere to be found in either table.2 screen shots below - assignment page showing 11/37 and detail page ( a little distorted but complete :))Screenshot:, Resolved,0
