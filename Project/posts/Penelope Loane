Wednesday October 2nd 2013 12:55 am -04:00,Some threads on this topic suggest that we have been given the code for board_contains_word_in_row therefore we dont need to write anything for this function.  We just use the code as a guide to solving board_contains_word_in_column.  Is this correct or am I missing something? , Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 1:16 am -04:00,Yes I have run it through the Online Python Tutor and it seems to work - that is why I am not sure whether we are being asked to do something else here. Does This function has been implemented in the starter code mean it is complete? Or are we supposed to be modifying the starter code in some way?  If we are please can you give me some direction - I dont have any good ideas at this point. , Resolved,0
