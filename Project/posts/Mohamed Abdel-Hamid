Tuesday September 24th 2013 3:31 pm -04:00,Dear TAsOn Sun 15 Sep 2013  9:01 AM PDT (UTC -0700) it was announced that the assignment submission deadline is to be relaxed in a manner that enables submission as often as liked. As a result; i submitted Assignment 2 after the initial prospective hard deadline. However i did not receive credit! So whats the deal? Do we get to submit anytime and receive credit or not?Thanks in advance.LTP1: assignment submission delay                                        Hi allWe have decided to relax the submission delay: you can now submit assignments as often as you like.  However if the load on the server ends up slowing it down significantly we may add a delay.Cheers-Paul and Jen                                        Sun 15 Sep 2013  9:01 AM PDT (UTC -0700)                                                , Resolved,-1
