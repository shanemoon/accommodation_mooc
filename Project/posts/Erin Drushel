Monday August 26th 2013 12:38 pm -04:00,For some reason the quizzes are not showing up in the videos this week.  I was able to go back to the first video and the quiz showed up then however I tried re-watching the second video to see if that would make the quizzes show up but it didnt work.  The video stops at the yellow bar but no quiz pops up.  Thanks in advance!, Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 1:10 pm -04:00,FYI I had to switch back to the html5 to view the video and then the quizzes showed up again., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:44 pm -04:00,No matter what I try to do for this function the for loop doesnt appear to go back to the originally inputted str.  Ive only been able to get it to assess the first character in the str.  Once that returns it seems to stop.  (Sorry for so little detail...trying to not give anything away)., Resolved,1
Wednesday September 11th 2013 6:28 pm -04:00,I must be doing something very wrong...even after your reminder - thanks for that - about a premature return Im apparently missing something.  I tried a few iterations of what I think you meant but its still coming up wrong...either just assessing the first letter or coming back with None or more often than not a TypeError...I guess Ill just keep at it.  Thanks for your help!, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 6:49 pm -04:00,Youre probably right lol.  Thanks again I really appreciate it!  I will definitely post again if I can get to a point to ask a better (yet still cryptic) question., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:11 pm -04:00,Have you tried switching the format between html5 and flash at the top of the lecture page?  That might help if you havent., Resolved,1
Thursday September 12th 2013 2:29 pm -04:00,Hi there!  Will the answer keys for the assignments be posted after the hard deadlines?  Ive managed to get the correct answers for both A1 and A2 however I have a feeling there might be a better (more efficient) way of getting the correct results and Id like the opportunity to review those codes to get a better understanding.  Thanks!, Unresolved,8
Friday September 13th 2013 10:54 am -04:00,Its about discovering best practices.  Of course there are multiple correct answers but in writing the code there are surely best practices to keep it simple.  So just because I got something right doesnt mean it was the best way to do it.  I think for the profs/staff to share this and keep it simple is to merely put the caveat stating there are multiple ways of getting it correct here are the best ways (or a couple of the better ways).  If you did something different and got it correct great.As for just going ahead and talking about the answers (even after the hard deadlines) based on the honour code thats breaking the rules.  So Im not surprised nobodys done it without some kind of consent if they want to continue to be in the course.  I guess the bottom line for me is I want to learn best practices and best practices are not necessarily what everyone else has done.  If what Ive done here is not the best way to achieve my coding goals and as a result is more likely to break during even more complex coding Id like to understand how to work through those issues., Unresolved,1
Friday September 13th 2013 4:00 pm -04:00,I do appreciate what youre saying but as the codes get more complicated (like Assignment 2) I believe it is helpful to the learning process to see what the best (or as I said better) ways of doing things., Unresolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 5:18 pm -04:00,Re Honour Code: Number 3 in the link attached.http://help.coursera.org/customer/portal/articles/1164381-what-is-the-honor-code-, Unresolved,1
Friday September 13th 2013 5:56 pm -04:00,This is my first course but I have a feeling its different for every course depending on the nature of the content.  That being said on this courses wiki page it also says: Please do not post code from exercise and assignment solutions. If you do this you may be removed from the course.  https://share.coursera.org/wiki/index.php/Programming1:MainSo Im basing my comments on those combined statements., Unresolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 3:58 pm -04:00,Thanks Etienne!  Appreciate you looking into it., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 11:39 am -04:00,What do you mean check?Im trying to work through this one but every time I write a code I get the error telling me that bool is not iterable...which I do understand however even with an or in an if statement.  And if I use a for loop first (followed by the if statement) I get a TypeError that says in <string> requires string as left operand not list.Thanks!, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 12:18 pm -04:00,Thank you so much!!  That was a great help!  Im apparently trying too hard to overthink :), Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 2:26 pm -04:00,This is very helpful...but for some reason now I cant get the first line to show up - but from line 2 to the end shows up and in the proper format.  Any thoughts?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 5:48 pm -04:00,Pretty sure I got it now!  Thanks!, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 7:09 pm -04:00,Embarrassed to say about 10 hours today 12 hours yesterday and about 7 hours on Tuesday...and now with a 36/37 Im probably going to call it done.  I spent much less time on the first 2 assignments., Unresolved,4
