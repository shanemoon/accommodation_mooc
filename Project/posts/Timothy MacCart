Friday August 23rd 2013 7:44 pm -04:00,Running on Mac OS X 10.8.2QUESTION 1: I restarted the shell typed in code:>>> def area (base height):	         return base * height / 2I saved it in a folder on my desktop as triangle.py  exactly as the instructor did.  When I open a the RUN menu and click Run module and type the area function in my shell window I receive this error: Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#3> line 1 in     area (10 7.45)NameError: name area is not definedQUESTION 2: Being that I saved the function I should be able to restart my python shell again and call the function shouldnt I?  QUESTION 3: It is also odd to me that I am working in two different windows but I should be calling functions in the shell as you cannot in the editor correct?Thanks!, Resolved,0

Friday August 23rd 2013 7:57 pm -04:00,Oh never mind.  I was saving the function in the shell and not the editor.  Thanks anyway!, Resolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 11:00 pm -04:00,Can anyone spot what is wrong with my code causing the function to not execute properly?  Ive been staring at it for awhile and have not spotted the error., Unresolved,0
