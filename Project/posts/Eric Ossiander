Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:39 am -04:00,It worked fine for me to use the starter program file. If you are still having problems I suggest following the instructions for the first function (seconds_difference) carefully and submitting a1.py with only that function done. You will get errors on all the other functions but once you get seconds_difference to work you can finish the other functions and submit again., Unresolved,1
