Thursday August 29th 2013 4:56 am -04:00,Hi Ive completed step 2 and tested the body I gave to the function seconds_difference and the examples are returning the expected results but when I submitted my code and clicked for feedback I got a score of 0/41. I submitted only the return code in .txt file... I would like to know how should I submit the code then? Should I submit the entire function code then in .py file? Thanks in advance!
