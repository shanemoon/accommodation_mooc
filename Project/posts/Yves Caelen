Monday September 30th 2013 4:33 pm -04:00,I cannot resist to this point to quote a few words from Czech writer Milan Kundera:Imagine that you meet a madman who claims that he is a fish and that we are all fish. Are you going to argue with him? Are you going to undress in front of him and show him that you dont have fins? Are you going to say to his face what you think?...If you told him the whole truth and nothing but the truth only what you thought you would enter into a serious conversation with a madman and you yourself would become mad.So lets not have a fight here... A fish battle would splash water everywhere in the internet. And thats why their clocks are so wrong.Remember :Â clocks do not like water.;-), Unresolved Locked,6
