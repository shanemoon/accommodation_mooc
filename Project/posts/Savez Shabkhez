Sunday August 25th 2013 8:50 am -04:00,The problem summary:Please review Q.10. I attempted it correctly. It has only two correct answers.

Either explain why I am wrong or fix the question. , Resolved,1

Word for word. And you should be fine.Word for word. Its mathematics more than programming. Also you might not have a natural inclination towards computers in which case just go with the flow. Just do what you can and enjoy! Dont worry about what you cant do., Resolved,2

You helped a lot! Its so incredibly simple. Ill give you a hint. The second find method is to be used inside the first. That give you any ideas? Combine that with all the great stuff above and voila! you have a genius. Me :), Resolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 3:14 am -04:00,Because it is not a str.find method. It is str.rfind. And so incorrect. The question forbids any other methods: use only str.find and +-*/ ()., Resolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 1:56 am -04:00,That cant be it. The punctuation isnt complicated. Have you figured out how youre going to get to the second instance? That is the main thing. As soon as you get that the punctuation is simple enough. Try messing around with the punctuation till you get it right. :)The second instance...could make a good movie title.Â  , Resolved,0
