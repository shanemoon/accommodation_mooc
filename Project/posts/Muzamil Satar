Sunday September 22nd 2013 5:41 pm -04:00,The return keyword will exit the function when if any of your if statements are called this basically exits the for loop after just one character has been checked. Dont use the return statement in your if statements instead:    1) make a boolean variable (such as valid_sequence) and set it True from the start.    2) use a for loop to go over each character    3) if any of the characters is not in ATCG then set the boolean variable to False    4) return the value of your boolean variable after the for loop, Unresolved,1
