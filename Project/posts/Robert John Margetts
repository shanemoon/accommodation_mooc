Monday September 2nd 2013 12:47 pm -04:00,Hey I had the same error but just resolved it.  I now have 42/41. To solve it think about what happens when the number of seconds goes above 24 hours and then add something to your code to allow for this ;-), Resolved,5
Friday September 20th 2013 11:14 am -04:00,Can anyone help me?  I think my code is right but I am getting nothing as an answer when I use get_compliment(complimentary_sequence)My code is as follows: complimentary_sequence =                    for char in dna:        if char in CGTA:           complimentary_sequence = complimentary_sequence + char            return get_compliment(complimentary_sequence)if I leave the get_compliment part out then the code returns the right characters just not the compliments.  It must be something to do with the get_compliment code which I wrote which works but im not sure if its correct.  Am I making a massive error somewhere?Thanks!, Unresolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 11:29 am -04:00,OK thank you for the spelling correction I oversaw that.  I now have 21 out of 24.  But the end part is still not working for some reason.  Do you mean I should move the get_compliment up like this:complimentary_sequence = get_complement(complementary_sequence) + char            return complementary_sequenceI tried that and get an error... Been trying this for ages now and would love some more tips if anyone can give me them! Thanks!, Unresolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 11:53 am -04:00,ahhhhh OK I got it now! I tried adding the get_complement parts to 2 of the 3 possibilities and ignored the third possibility for some reason! Thanks so much!, Unresolved,0
