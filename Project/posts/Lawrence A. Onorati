Thursday September 12th 2013 3:57 am -04:00,The problem summary:Help please.  I loaded the assignment 1 code submission - which after a bit of a struggle completely worked with the clock.  However I have not seen a grade and this concerns me.  I am using a work computer with my compainies consent.  The computers are very secure and I had to have the IT guys and gals download some of the course material.I just want to make sure that my submission has been accepted.  Note that the last two submissions have not yet been graded.  Can some one get back to me please?Thank you.  Larry OnoratiSteps to reproduce:Screenshot:, Unresolved,0
