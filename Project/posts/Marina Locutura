Saturday September 14th 2013 5:56 am -04:00,I agree with Erin. I was thinking the same...I managed to do the assigments but...Im no sure if its the best way so I hope they give us a feedback with the most directly way to write the code. :), Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 2:58 am -04:00,Hi everyone!Im struggling with this question! Each time I write my code Pythos says to me that the return is outside the function. It must be at the same level than the first line of the code? Im puzzle!   , Resolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 3:09 am -04:00,My thougt is: 1. Create an empty list                      2. Create a for loop within a range                     3. stop the loop using while                      4. using list.append we add each odd number to a list                     5. We can say to Phyton than sum all the elements of a listToo complicated?, Resolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 4:42 am -04:00,It might sounds stupid but...is it neccessary to change something in board_contains_word_in_row? Or just leave it and modify the board_contains_word_in_column?Thank you!, Unresolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 6:05 am -04:00,thaks Tom! Youre very kind!I did that but I get an error: Index Error. list index out of range., Unresolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 6:16 am -04:00,I have just changed it and Ive solved the error! Thanks Tom!I still have two errors from the beginning being unable to fix them I decided to keep on writing the code but Im afraid I wont get the maximum mark.Maybe you could give some ideas about this two errors:1) when they test:  test_a3.Test_01_ReadWords.test_03_multi_line_file (which I havent written yet) ---> object of Type NoneType has no len()2) ehrn they test: the same for one line --> the same error.I dont understand this.thank you!, Unresolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 4:25 am -04:00,Rodrigo Im not very good at this stuff anyway Ill try to help you.You should think that you want the programme gives you and string so that instead of give an empty list...give an empty string as accumulator.Then try to write a for loop. For this think about one of the exercise of the Week 6 Homework (question 7). You need to think about the index you need and put them in the for loop.Anyway in other thread in the forum there ase so much better explanations!Good luck!, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 1:16 pm -04:00,I am at the same point. I think we shouldnt open the file just read it. I will try with readlines...good luck!, Unresolved,3
Saturday October 5th 2013 8:37 am -04:00,CongratulationS! I have just finished and get 37 and what a relief!!! After you manage to write the code it looks so simple isnt it? , Resolved,1
