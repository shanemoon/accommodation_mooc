Monday August 19th 2013 1:23 am -04:00,Im in Toronto and work in a somewhat related field. Ive always been interested in programming and have heard from many others that Python is a great language. Looking forward to learning more about it.,None,1
Sunday August 25th 2013 1:11 am -04:00,I installed CoursePad on my iPad (4th gen iOS 6.1.3) and I cant get past the login screen. It crashes a few seconds after I enter my credentials. Anyone else using this app successfully have any tips?, Resolved,0
Saturday August 24th 2013 4:43 pm -04:00,I have a friend who is a programmer and he also uses Pythonista for the iPad. He really likes it. Im a novice and am probably going to go with Python 3.3 for iOS because it is running the same version Ive installed on my laptop as well as the required one for the course (3.X). Pythonista is still using version 2.7 as noted by Gian above. , Resolved,1
