Saturday August 31st 2013 1:51 pm -04:00,I have the same thing happening as above.  I have submitted steps 2 3 and 4 to make sure I am submitting properly and to check my work.  When I run my file in IDLE and then test the functions in the Python Shell by using the examples they work correctly and I am getting the same result as the examples provided by the downloaded a1.py file.  I am running Python 3.3.2 on OS X.  What am I do incorrectly and how can I correct this so that I can submit and it will get graded?, Resolved,0
