Tuesday August 27th 2013 8:49 am -04:00,Hello!As a beginner in Python Ive reached my first big obstacle in this course. I cannot seem to understand this concept at all or how to figure out what the body is supposed to mean. In the video it seems easy but when I tried the exercise question 14 & 15 that relates to this just did not make any sense for me so I need to take it from the beginning again! So can anybody help me with this whole section? How do I know what to write in the body? and how to call two functions in the body?Thanks a lot!!!!!, Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 11:53 am -04:00,Hey Thanks so much people!! I think I get it now its just to make things quicker and easier so we dont need to write the same stuff again and again instead we use one function to get different answers to the same problems! Yay!!, Resolved,1

Wednesday August 28th 2013 4:52 pm -04:00,The most important step when learning something new is to NOT give up! So keep trying until you make it because you will get it as long as you try! But you are on the right track I can see that on your code!Now on to your problem. You need to study the function design recipe (video 3 - 5) in order to understand what each part of the function is supposed to do. The return - statement or the Body as its really called is supposed to execute your code. So if you are making a smoothie you might have already put all the ingredients in the mixer but you havent pressed the button that will mix your smoothie together and that will be the final step before you have a ready to drink beverage.The same idea applies to the function design recipe all the other lines are your ingredients your tools which you use the function for but the return is what mixes all those ingredients into what will then become the final product.So think of what you want with your code. You want to know how many seconds different are the two times right? How do you outside of Python in real life calculate the difference between two things? Just like you have started to do you subtract them with each other in order to get the difference.The problem with your code is the seconds_difference in that line. seconds_difference is a function and you dont need to return the actual function you need to return the value of that function. So what is the value? time_1 and time_2. And what was it again we needed to do? calculate the difference between time_1 and time_2. So in other words you need to take out seconds_difference from the body(return) and see what happens!Does that make sense? Let me know otherwise!, Unresolved,1
Thursday August 29th 2013 3:44 am -04:00,Hello!I was just wondering how to write the Body in the 1st assignment step 3 & 4.Since we are supposed to return a float is it necessary to write like this:return float (code)or is this enough:return codeDoesnt / automatically return a float? or will that just be considered being sloppy if I dont explicitly write float in the body?, Resolved,0

Saturday September 14th 2013 3:06 pm -04:00,Hello!Im struggling with this one too!I tried several different versions on the for loop but it didnt work after reading the forums where many peoples advise was to use the str.count() function tried that one too but I cant seem to get it right what am I doing wrong? This is what I wrote:return count_nucleotides.count(nucleotide in dna), Unresolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 7:53 am -04:00,Yeah Im stuck on this as well only one I keep getting an error on! My code kinda goes like this:var = 0for char in range length of word:if length of word is bigger than or equal to 3 AND smaller than 6:var = length of word * 1elif length of word is bigger than or equal to 6 AND smaller than 10:var = length of word * 2elif length of word is bigger than 10:var = length of word * 3return varEverything works fine until I use a word with over 20 letter. Example 22 letter times 3 is supposed to be 63 but it turns it into 33 instead. Thanks for the help!!!, Resolved,0
