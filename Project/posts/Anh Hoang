Friday September 13th 2013 5:19 pm -04:00,Here is the code I put in Python Tutor:def convert_to_min(hours):        (int) -> int    Convert hours to minutes.    >>> convert_to_min(2)    120        result = hours * 60    return resultmins(2)= convert_to_min(2)mins(3)= convert_to_min(3)Its similar to the lecture code yet I cant visualize it since the page told me that I cant assign strings to function calls. Do you know why since I thought by the time I executed 2 last lines then convert_to_min(2) would point to a value already.Also why must we write result = hours * 60 and return result not  result = hours * 60 ?, Unresolved,0

Do not count y.>>> count_vow(You lost it this time)5>>> count_vow(I will stop waiting)6    num_vow = 0        for char in s:        if char in aeiouAEIOU:        num_vow = num_vow + 1            return num_vowAnyone knows what the prob is. Many thanks:)., Unresolved,0
