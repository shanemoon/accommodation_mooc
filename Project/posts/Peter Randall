Tuesday September 10th 2013 11:03 am -04:00,Hi EdwinFYI - this is Q13 in the Week 3 Exercise and nothing to do with Assignment 2 (given out this week - week 4!)Anyhoo the passing grade if exactly one grade is a passing grade means that if the person passes only 1 class the code returns the value of that grade only...e.g. grade1 = 49 grade2 = 52 code returns 52.Hope that helps., Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 10th 2013 3:46 pm -04:00,The problem summary: Assignment 2 step 5 (ii) the two tests for get_complementary_sequence(str) produce a FAILURE when marked unless you allow lowercase (a t c and g). And as we know from step 3 is_valid_sequence(str) A string is not a valid DNA sequence if it contains lowercase letters.I had to change my code to allow atcg as well as ATCG which feels a bit umm...cheat-y.>>>get_complementary_sequence(AT) +  PeteSteps to reproduce:Write code that only allows capital letters like your told to in step 3 then submit your code to the less-pedantic-than-me marking machine.Screenshot:, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 5:18 pm -04:00,My code worked in IDLE but I got 22/24 on first submission. I re-wrote bits and checked get_complementary_sequence(str) like a hundred times (about 10 really) in IDLE and it still worked. I subd again and still got 22/24. Then I just changed the code to allow lowercase actg and ka-pow...full marks.I really just posted so that anyone else stuck like that would know what to do., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 6:15 am -04:00,I think Ive been misunderstood. I was just trying to help anyone else with the same problem.My original code worked perfectly in IDLE but I didnt get full marks until (i.e. I now have 24/24 so no longer care much) I allowed lowercase atcg.Thats all if it didnt happen to you then I must be wrong about the auto-marking and this thread is a waste of everyones time. Sorry about that. Good luck with the rest of the course everyone., Resolved,0
