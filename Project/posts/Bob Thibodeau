Friday August 23rd 2013 8:03 pm -04:00,Thanks Etienne. If I may make a suggestion it would be better for batch downloading if each pdf file had a unique name instead of multiple Quiz1 Quiz2 etc., Resolved,1
Friday August 23rd 2013 7:48 pm -04:00,Looks like theres a space before your open paren. Make sure you have area() instead of area () so that python knows you have a function and not an unset variable., Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 1:11 am -04:00,The QPython console isnt connected to the editor the way that IDLE is. You have to define the function directly in the console. Copy and paste works. Remember that function definitions in the console end by typing an extra newline. If you see ... instead of >>> hit ENTER again., Unresolved,1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 9:08 am -04:00,You can copy and paste (Control-V) from the editor to the console. QP didnt even have a console a few weeks ago so we can expect (hope?) that better integration is coming. You could also examine the included helloworld.py script to see how to show results in a notification.BTW I noticed that QP uses Python 2.7.2 which doesnt match our needs for this course., Unresolved,1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 10:38 am -04:00,found this: http://qpython.org/question/596/run-script-in-console/in the first line of your script write#qpy:consoleadd a print statement at the bottom for any output you want to see return values will not be shown.EX:  print area(34)(again note that you use the python 2.7 version of the print statement)It will run the script and exit to the system shell you will not be in an interactive python shell. Close the console and go back to the editor to run it again., Unresolved,1

Wednesday August 28th 2013 9:32 am -04:00,That can happen. Just replace each of your tabs with 4 spaces. Did you copy and paste some of your code from an external editor?Thats happened to me when I mix IDLE and Gvim., Resolved,0

Saturday August 31st 2013 7:38 pm -04:00,You could also do:>>> print(The number is  + str(7 + 3))The number is 10>>> print(The number is str(7 + 3))The number is 10Note that when using a comma theres no need to add a space after is., Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 7:29 pm -04:00,I think the reason will be clearer in later lessons when it gets more important to distinguish between two variables that hold equal values as opposed to two variables that are equal to each other.The first case involves two memory addresses and can be modified independently.The second case is one memory address called by two names where changing either one also changes the other.Not understanding that point could lead to runtime errors., Resolved,3
Wednesday September 4th 2013 3:41 am -04:00,Try typing python3 in the terminal. When both versions are installed python defaults to 2.If your terminal has tab completion type python[TAB]and you will see the available commands that start with python. ,None,0
