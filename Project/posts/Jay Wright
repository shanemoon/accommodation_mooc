Monday August 19th 2013 1:09 pm -04:00,Hello everyoneMy name is Jay and Ive been proramming since I was 11 and I am now 25.Â  I started out in VB5 moved up to VB6 then moved to VB.NET. I know a number of languages however for scripting I mostly use Ruby but Python is clearly more powerful of a language and have decided to learn and move over to Python for as much of my coding as possible. I currently work for Wells Fargo Bank as a Business Systems Consultant. Im also a U.S. Navy Veteran.,None,0
Monday August 19th 2013 1:18 pm -04:00,You will need more than just Python as a programming language my friend. You will need a multitude of languages you can turn to depending on the situtation. Python is powerful and can do many things but its not a one and done language. You need more than just that one language. It cant do everything you need for a job.,None,1
