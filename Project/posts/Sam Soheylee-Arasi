Monday August 26th 2013 10:27 pm -04:00,Hello there.I am using Python IDLE on Windows 8. I have completed the first weeks assignment and have noticed a few discrepancies between the test answers and my Python returns. I will display them below;[~ep]\color{red}{ext{[~ep]}}----------------------------------[~ep]\color{red}{ext{[~ep]}}And lastly none of my divisions return as a float always an Int rounded to the nearest whole number. If Im doing something wrong please let me know. Cheers!Sam             [Edit: please do not post graded quiz answers. ~ep]\color{red}{ext{[Edit: please do not post graded quiz answers. ~ep]}}, Resolved,0
