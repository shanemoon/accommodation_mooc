Wednesday August 21st 2013 2:48 am -04:00,Honestly if youre using Python 2.x you need to stop and start migrating code to 3. Beyond laziness sticking with Python 2 is a bad idea. Compared to Python 3 Python 2 is bloated inconsistent in syntax and inefficient. The sooner you move away from 2 the better the entire Python community will be., Resolved,2
Wednesday August 21st 2013 2:59 am -04:00,IDLE has a text editor and it also acts as an IDE. Its usually installed by default. You can use any number of text editors with Python honestly. I prefer Notepad++ myself. Honestly you should stay away from heavy GUI-based editors when youre first starting out programming. GUIs have a tendency to hide what is actually going on when you run or compile something so its good to get familiar with a basic text editor and the command line to run it., Resolved,1
Wednesday August 21st 2013 12:20 am -04:00,Parameters define the limits of arguments. Arguments are pieces of information that are given when a call to a function is made so the best way to think about it is that when you define a function you will also define the parameters for the arguments it will accept if called., Resolved,1

Wednesday August 21st 2013 1:28 am -04:00,We now have an IRC chat room for real-time discussion. If you already have an IRC client just use the IRC address listed. You can also access the IRC chat room here.IRC Address: irc://irc.freenode.netChannel: #coursera-ltp, Pinned Approved,8
Tuesday August 27th 2013 9:19 pm -04:00,Its just a chat room to talk with other students and TAs to help each other. It allows for you to not have to sign up for IM account and just get straight to talking with someone about class related material. IRC is used for all kinds of things I just set this up to compliment what is already in place., Pinned Approved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 4:41 pm -04:00,Docstring styling of a function seems somewhat pedantic but I thought it was odd it quipped over me doing this(str) -> (number)instead of(str) -> numberSince a docstring will not affect the actual function itself in any meaningful way that seems more like youre teaching code styling than actually teaching programming.EDIT: Please do not downvote discussion that is giving feedback in which a student is disagreeing. The purpose of voting is to spur discussion not show who you agree with., Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 5:00 pm -04:00,After speaking with one of the TAs after posting this but before you replied I think I was convinced of your point. Code styling can be important and I see validity in the long-term approach it advocates. I know Ive come across shared code before that had me scratching my head but one of your TAs also pointed out the usefulness of the doctest module to test a function. This alone makes proper documentation vital to ensuring that a function can be properly understood., Resolved,2
Thursday August 29th 2013 5:02 am -04:00,But string is not a valid type str is even if str is meant to represent a string. Thats important because it is concisely indicating the data type that Python interprets., Resolved,0

Thursday August 29th 2013 8:27 am -04:00,The problem summary:Week 2 Assignment 1 Instruction handout gives a misleading idea that one is supposed to stop after Step 2 as their is no sensible reason to submit your code if youhave not completed the assignment yet. Please reword Step 2 or advise to continue to other steps AFTER submitting initial code worked on in Step 2., Unresolved,2
