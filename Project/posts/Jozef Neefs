Monday August 19th 2013 7:40 pm -04:00,Managed to reproduce your problem: bottom right corner is a gear??? settings?? It stated I have html5 (-odd). Clicked it and got a text-balloon saying to click it if I wanted to change player. I did so and then it used Flash. When using Flash the video stopped at the Quizz not showing the questions. Switched back to htm-odd 5 and then it showed the questions AND the skip submit and Continue buttons. So perhaps you try to switch to html5 or use Internet Explorer; but with IE you cannot have the viewer in full screen., Resolved,1
