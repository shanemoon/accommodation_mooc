Friday August 30th 2013 11:23 pm -04:00,your hr will be the hour that is is I went with time for mine. you have to have that number that is in the definition DOING something.If you would have taken out the to_24_hour_clock put the parenthesis around (60*60)  (or simplified it to 3600) and just put return hr // 3600  it would be fine.I did return time // 3600 while time is the variable that is in the definition., Resolved,2
