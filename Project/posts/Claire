Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:35 pm -04:00,HiI was wondering the same thing as Anthony: I am in California where it is roughly 12:30pm (utc-8) which means it should be 8:30pm at utc-0 but the clock showed 7:30pm. It seems to me that according to the program the local time is the time as we see it but the UTC-0 time is the time as it should be in the UTC-0 regions (= the real time) but not the one people actually see on their clocks because of the summer time change.Â , Unresolved,0
