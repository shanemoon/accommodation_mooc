Friday September 6th 2013 6:27 am -04:00,Ive done the following:./configure --prefix=/usr/people/douglas/programs/Python-3.3.2/installmakemake installThis worked OK. Then:cd /usr/people/douglas/programs/Python-3.3.2/install/bin./idle.3.3gives:Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: Unable to get the locale encodingImportError: No module named encodingsAbortIf I set an environment variable manually I get a new error:setenv PYTHONHOME /usr/people/douglas/programs/Python-3.3.2/install./idle3.3** IDLE cant import Tkinter.  Your Python may not be configured for Tk. **I thought Tcl-Tk was included in the Python installation?

Friday September 6th 2013 7:16 am -04:00,I notice this message when running make:INFO: Cant locate Tcl/Tk libs and/or headersPython build finished but the necessary bits to build these modules were not found:_lzma              _tkinter                           To find the necessary bits look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the modules name.detect_modules() starts on line 437 in setup.py presumably I need to add the Tcl/Tk libs and/or headers somewhere in here. I have installed ActiveTcl8.5.14., Unresolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 7:53 am -04:00,I added the following to line 441 of setup.py:        add_dir_to_list(self.compiler.library_dirs /usr/people/douglas/programs/ActiveTcl8.5.14/lib)        add_dir_to_list(self.compiler.include_dirs /usr/people/douglas/programs/ActiveTcl8.5.14/include)make still wouldnt work until I added the new installation to the library search pathsetenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/people/douglas/programs/ActiveTcl8.5.14/libnow make runs and _tkinter is missing from the list of things it says it didnt build., Unresolved,0
