I actually had to read through the code to figure out what was asked of us.The wording of the questions make a big difference in how easy it is to understand and complete the exercises!Its basically saying: The printed value should be 0.0 if neither grade is a pass ...or... if only one grade is a pass print the value of that grade ...or... if both grades are a pass print the the average of the 2 grades., Unresolved,8
