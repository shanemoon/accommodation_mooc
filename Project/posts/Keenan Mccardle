Tuesday August 27th 2013 3:51 pm -04:00,I first noticed with the hours_difference function that I get a rounding error with subtracting floats. After some research online this seems to be an issue with the way python stores floating point numbers on my machine.For example:>>> 0.7-0.60.09999999999999998Is this something that will affect my score on this and future assignments? The code I have is otherwise correct and works in most cases. If this is something I should try to change what is the best way to go about doing so?, Resolved,0
