Friday September 27th 2013 8:39 am -04:00,I followed the lecture along with the Python shell open as I always do and copied the code as it was put through. It all worked just as was shown in the lecture up until the finishing touches.I have poured over it again and again but I cant see where Ive gone wrong. No matter what I do I cant seem to get Python to execute the program. Whenever i open the output file (a1_test.hist) it is blank. Then if I open the other (a1_grades.txt) it has become blank and I have to enter in the grades again! I decided to add some print commands to my code to see if Python got up to executing them but it appears that it does not. The shell just hangs and nothing happens.Any help that can be offered would be much appreciated! Here is a screenshot (apologies for the large size I am using a 1440p screen):, Resolved,0
