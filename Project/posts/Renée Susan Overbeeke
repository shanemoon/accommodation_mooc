Sunday September 1st 2013 9:26 am -04:00,Hello fellow CourseriansWhen working on the lecture of the Function Design Recipe and assignment 1 I frequently received the Expected an indented block Error. Why is it that Python sees this as an error and how? Why does it need a tab first?Thanks in advance!Ren√©e, Unresolved,1
