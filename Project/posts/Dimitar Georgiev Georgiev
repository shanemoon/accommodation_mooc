Saturday August 31st 2013 7:47 am -04:00,Hello fellows I have some experience with C and after watching the first couple of video lectures I wanted to ask these questions:1) When you defined variables there were no type definitions? 2) You mentioned max()abs() as functions in C those are macros in order to make them be able return different data types. Are there macros in Python and what is the difference there?3) About the values and variables you explained pointers in a pretty understandable but somehow unclear way. e.g. we define a variable var lets say it is stored in address x1 which points to value 1 next we change the value and now it points to x2 where the value is 3. In C in order to use the properties of a pointer you have to define it as such and my question is what happens with the old value because if we just use another memory location anytime we change the value... this is so inefficient... I hope you understood my question.Thank you for the effort!D. Georgiev  , Resolved,1

Saturday August 31st 2013 8:35 am -04:00,Thank you for your attention. Im sorry if my questions seem inappropriate for the programming language but Im an electronics engineer and also program in assembly and there memory usage is everything and maybe I pay too much attention to such things that are not a focus in such language. Memory types are mostly used in C to preserve memory by using exactly as much as needed and to make some machine independent programs guess that is not an issue in Python. Thank you again guys I appreciate it., Resolved,1
