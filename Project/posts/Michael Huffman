Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:50 am -04:00,I think I agree with the others in that the quiz is being a bit too pedantic based on what was lectured previously. Take for example the type contract for the area function - it uses (number number) -> number also which by convention should be (number number) -> float. There was not any lecturing previous to the quiz in regards to choice of wording in the type contract. I think moving the quiz to the spot right after the video shows Paul changing to (number) -> float in the convert_to_celsius function (5:35ish) would solve it all. Sorry for not starting a new thread - didnt think it was warranted. , Resolved,5

The answer is: youre calling the defined function at the return so instead of returning to the caller youre calling the count function again. This creates an infinite loop. I think you meant to return x instead of return count(x)def count(x):    if x < 99999:        return x+1Would work just as well. Also a side note you might want to reconsider the name as the function itself doesnt count anything - it just increments a number (perhaps increment or inc would be a better name?).,None,0
