Saturday September 28th 2013 5:59 pm -04:00,I dont understand what you are doing there. return new_variable[row_index] it seems to me you return the board[row_index] here.Look up for a method from string Class called .join(). There is a trick you can do with this method to join lists even if its not from list Class. Take a look here: http://www.faqs.org/docs/diveintopython/odbchelper_join.htmlIts a different example but its a good one., Resolved,0

Sunday September 29th 2013 8:53 am -04:00,Its quite straightforward. Just use the return that Tom Enos gave you and dont put in like you said upper. You dont need to use IF or IN I mean I dont know why are you getting that TypeError without seeing your body function but I guess that youre trying to get <something> (which evaluates to FALSE) in  <something else>  => which results in a TypeError., Unresolved,3
Monday September 30th 2013 3:34 am -04:00,There are a lot of functions that you can make in only one line of code :) But its not necessarily an improvement., Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 3:52 am -04:00,Indeed python was my main language and implemented some games in it years ago. Now i look at code and barely know what I did there. But I learn something always comment your code!. If you work in team comment the code even if its not yours, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 10:14 am -04:00,I get this when i execute your code:TypeError: argument of type bool is not iterable Be sure your board_contains_word_in_column is correct. You can check with this:board_contains_word_in_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]] TO) # Trueboard_contains_word_in_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]] TB) # Trueboard_contains_word_in_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]] NO) # Falseboard_contains_word_in_row -> return booleanboard_contains_word_in_colum -> return booleanand your codeif board_contains_word_in_row(board word) or word in board_contains_word_in_colum(board word):Seems to be if True/False or word in True/False:    return Truereturn FalseIt makes no sense to me.Use what Tom Enos gave you:return function(arg1 arg2) or function(arg1 arg2) In python you dont have to use something like this: if x == True. Its silly because == is binary operator which means he always return something True or False. Same thing here.You dont have to put if board_contains_word_in_row(board word) beacuse we know that function return True or False. You dont want to test if that is true or false. I cant be more explicit., Unresolved,3
Saturday September 28th 2013 3:45 pm -04:00,Are you sure you are using return and not print? Im asking this beacause a lot of people tests their function with print. Also you should see the details in feedback sesion. Click view under feedback column than click All to see whats going bad in your submission. , Unresolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 5:24 pm -04:00,It seems to me you dont have a return in read_board function.. Look up maybe something is wrong indented., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 5:37 pm -04:00,You test with given example: board_contains_word_in_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]] TO) and say that problem occurs when you pass the second column.Maybe you didnt pay attention when you call len() and call it for board. That will be 2! So AX and NS will be True but TO and TB will be False.Number of columns are numbers of letters from the first line in board as Tom Enos said., Unresolved,2
Saturday September 28th 2013 5:45 pm -04:00,If you have used the previous two functions you probably made a mistake in board_contains_word_in_column. A common one is not paying attention to the column_index that goes up to the length of the first line in board., Unresolved,0

Sunday September 29th 2013 3:14 am -04:00,When you have tested previous functions you did with a row [A N T T] or a board [ [A N T T] [X S O B]]. For this two functions you have two input files with text in it and you have to make rows or board. Read the top comment of the assignment file. You have to open the two files in order to test the functions but after that you can remove that chunk of code because its not necessarily to pass the grader.A pseudo code for read_board:make an empty listfor every line in the input file    make another empty list which is gonna hold the rows    for every letter in the line youve read        if its not the end of line            append the letter to the temp list    append the temp list to the empty listHope this helps with last function. It can be done better than that but this is the logic of it., Unresolved,2
