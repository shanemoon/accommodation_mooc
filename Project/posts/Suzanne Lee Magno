Monday September 2nd 2013 12:06 pm -04:00,this happened to me as well. I submitted my assignment at exactly 8:59 AM so I dont understand why I am being told that I am not receiving credit for it.Â  , Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 12:09 pm -04:00,to be clear you stated:Hard Deadline                                                                                Mon  2 Sep 2013  8:59 AM PDT (UTC -0700)                                                        If you submit any time after the hard deadline you will not receive credit.                            I submitted at 8:59 not after  so I would like to challenge this determination, Resolved,0
