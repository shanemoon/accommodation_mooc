Thursday September 12th 2013 6:24 pm -04:00,Hi  I am very behind in the course and missed out on assignment 1.  I want to still move on with the course.  I also want to still attempt assignment 1.  I cannot figure out how to open the file in IDLE?  Do I save as and put it somewhere then open IDLE to open it?  I am having a lot of trouble.  Thanks, Unresolved,0
