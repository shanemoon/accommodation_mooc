Thursday October 3rd 2013 10:49 pm -04:00,So I guess that when I run the driver it will not show the list and sub list of words? also I submitted a3 to the autograder I still get two errors student: test_a3.Test_01_ReadWords.test_02_one_line_fileFAILURE[x]Method Description:NoneMessage:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Wrong value returned on a one-line file.student: test_a3.Test_01_ReadWords.test_03_multi_line_fileFAILURE[x]Method Description:NoneMessage:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Wrong value returned on a one-line file.Thanks for the help but I have to get some sleep know thanks for looking into it for me:), Unresolved,0
