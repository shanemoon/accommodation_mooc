Wednesday August 28th 2013 8:22 pm -04:00,Okay I got a 41/41 but I also got this:Summary: Test results statistics - All=41; Errors=36; Failures=0; Successes=5; Warnings=0. Duration: 0:00:00.025334 [H:M:S].I dont like the fact that there were errors.  Since nothing failed I assume that I might have an extra pair of parenthesis or something not fatal.  But Id like to know what the errors were.  Also will we see the preferred way of writing the code at some point?  Mine might work but somehow I think I did it the hard way., Unresolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 8:56 pm -04:00,Thanks!  I must have looked at the first result which was for the initial submission.  I got a 41/41 and zero errors.But thinking I had errors I made a change and created failures.  Went back to the original and just got this.Summary: Test results statistics - All=41; Errors=0; Failures=0; Successes=41; Warnings=0. Duration: 0:00:00.009682 [H:M:S]., Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 5:57 am -04:00,I dont know the update command!  I realize thats the problem but I dont see it when I list help.  Frankly Im almost at the point of I dont care.  Return works!  Why not use it?  Ive tried list.add list.iadd and I cant get it to keep the updated value in the function., Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:03 am -04:00,I want to add my thanks also.  I have finished everything also.  The course was well done and really at my beginner level.  Most of the time when I was frustrated it was because I was making the task harder than you intended!    I do have a question about how to get the certificate that I did the work.  Did I have to do something at the beginning (that I missed).  It isnt too urgent but would be a nice to have.,None,2
