Friday October 4th 2013 2:04 am -04:00,Hi!I just wanted to know if there is another way to submit the assignment or get our assignment checked for correctness before submission. The autograder keeps changing my raw score from 20/37 to 0/37 and I cant figure out a way to check the problem.Â I feel like auto grader is consuming more of my time. Please help!, Unresolved,0
