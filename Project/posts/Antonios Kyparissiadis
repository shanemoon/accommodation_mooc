Tuesday September 24th 2013 5:54 am -04:00,Hi allI think that the second example given in this video is not a very good one given that the iteration is redundant. Just with the two list methods presented in the previous week I did this>>> list1 = [a b c d]>>> removed = list1.pop(0)>>> list1.append(removed)>>> list1[b c d a]I believe one can easily see how this is put in a function.Please correct me if I am wrong or not getting something.CheersAntonis, Unresolved,0
