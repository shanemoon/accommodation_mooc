Wednesday August 28th 2013 2:57 pm -04:00,The docstring does not constitute a hard contract your function is not obligated to output an int or a float. Python uses duck typing (i.e. it will determine the data type after it has the result). If the modulo operation outputs an int the function will return an int.In other languages you could typecast the final result to a float. In Python this is not possible., Resolved,0
