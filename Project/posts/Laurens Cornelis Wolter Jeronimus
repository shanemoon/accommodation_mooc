Tuesday August 27th 2013 3:46 pm -04:00,Thanks Anonymous and Nicolas! So now I have only 1 question left: when I practice along with the lectures and I type my code in the shell what is the most practical way to save it? Up to now these lecture files (directly typed in the shell window) or whatever one should call them (ending on .py anyway) dont function after reopening. The triangle file (also ending on .py which is confusing!!) however does! When I run the triangle file and call one of its functions say area(45) in the shell it works. In this file editing window however stuff like 3+4 enter doesnt work. So is the conclusion correct that this file editing window is used for the definition of functions which can be called in the shell? And the shell is the master board on which one can call functions defined and run in other file editing windows? Many thanks in advance!, Resolved,0
