Friday September 6th 2013 2:08 pm -04:00,Really interesting challenge! enjoyed it thanks to OPHere is my solution:from random import randintdef collatz():        number_list =             # creates a blank array    starting_number = randint(11000000)    # generate a random number under a million        c_number = starting_number  # assign starting number to c_number (Current Number)        while c_number >= 1:        # keeps running                if c_number == 1:       # if c_number is 1 show stats            number_list.append(c_number)                        # Add Number 1 to the list            print(Done!)            print(Starting Number was: starting_number)      # gives starting number            print(Length of the chain is:len(number_list))   # give the length of list            print(Max value in chain is: max(number_list))   # gives the max number in the list            return print(Yhatzee!)                            # Ends the function program complete!                    elif c_number % 2 == 0: # if even first add to the list and then divide by 2            number_list.append(c_number)            c_number = c_number // 2                    elif c_number % 2 != 0: # if odd first add to list then perform computation            number_list.append(c_number)            c_number = (c_number * 3) + 1And here are few runs of this code:EDIT : right-click on the image and open it in new tabLooks like i misread the question. i think instead of taking a random number i have start from 1 upto 1 million and see which number produces the longest chain what is the max number in that chain am i right?i guess by removing the random starting number and giving a number starting from 1 upto 1 million should do it using another while loop. :),None,1
Friday September 6th 2013 3:07 pm -04:00,Okay so this is my another post with a modified solutionthis time i ran the iteration for 1 million times and then compared which number produces the longest chaini did this by running code million times using while and then adding every iteration to starting_number_list max_value_list and length_list in separate arrays took close to 1 minuteused the max() function on length_list to get the maximum value of lengththen used the index() function to get the index of maximum lengthand then used that index in starting_value_list and max_value_listhowever this is how it looks:def collatz(starting_number):        number_list =             # creates a blank array        c_number = starting_number  # assign starting number to c_number (Current Number)        while c_number >= 1:        # keeps running                if c_number == 1:       # if c_number is 1 show stats            number_list.append(c_number)            starting_number_list.append(starting_number)            length_list.append(len(number_list))            max_value_list.append(max(number_list))            return                    elif c_number % 2 == 0: # if even first add to the list and then divide by 2            number_list.append(c_number)            c_number = c_number // 2                    elif c_number % 2 != 0: # if odd first add to list then perform computation            number_list.append(c_number)            c_number = (c_number * 3) + 1starting_number_list = max_value_list = length_list = iteration = 1while iteration < 1000001 :    collatz(iteration)    iteration += 1index = length_list.index(max(length_list))print(Max value:max_value_list[index])print(Seed value for Max value: starting_number_list[index])print(Length of chain for Seed Value: length_list[index])and the result is:i hope this is the correct solutionPS - So much fun! close to 1 AM!  gotta sleep :),None,1
Friday September 6th 2013 1:13 pm -04:00,I was reading a post from Jeff Atwoods Blog - Coding horrorand this post intrigued me - http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.htmlInteresting and inside that post is a coding task that is often asked in job interviews - FizzBuzz test.from blogs post:Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.your answer should look like this 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 Fizz Buzz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz .....Im not an experienced programmer and it took me less than 10 minutes to solve it in python (okay - few more minutes for thinking inside my head!)you too can solve this if you have completed week 3 lectures. only thing extra will be a for loop that im sure you can see in python docsCheers!,None,3

It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a left shift of 3 D would be replaced by A Ewould become B and so on.

Thursday September 19th 2013 5:30 am -04:00,how can we store the result of calculator in a text file?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 5:52 am -04:00,yup that works too But i was looking for some file methods like which will write it into a text file like a log filewell a good learning exercise for me ill look up some Python Files I/O topics and try to incorporate it., Resolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 7:10 am -04:00,that was great Nick thanks alot!Its just what i desiredSo now it prints out in a text file and do not print in console perhaps we can use double print functions one for text file and another for consolenot really neccessary but a workaround, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 3:56 am -04:00,what differs is that in one question where b =a  aliasing property is taken in account which will decide the outputs.check out Mutability and Aliasing lecture again you will gain more clarityIn aliasing like b = a (where a and b are both list) refer to the same object thats why any change to that object whether from a or b will affect list simultaneously., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 6:46 am -04:00,i recently made a text based hangman game and i was facing similar problem so ended up making a function for specifically this task.def list_to_string(sequence):        list(str) -> str        takes the sequence of strings and returns as a complete single string    >>>list_to_string([a b c])    abc        name =     for num in sequence:        name += num    return name# you can use it as:mylist =  [p e A T r l]my_list_string = list_to_string(mylist)>>> my_list_stringpeATrlbut as Nick pointed out a one line solution i will try to use that.btw my text based hangman is here : https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2143#post-12902, Resolved,2
Tuesday September 24th 2013 2:19 pm -04:00,im in confusion too..do we have to store links that Tom described like visible hyperlinks ?or links from the source code of page which has  href tagsexample = view-source:http://www.python.org/,None,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 1:49 am -04:00,okay one question..links which have href tags are clickable links ? or links which has title tags? or both ?these links right?,None,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 1:03 am -04:00,I think http:// after href tag will be a good selectionAlthough this can be done with some string manipulation but as a practice for new concept i think RegEx will be a good thing. thoughts?,None,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 2:46 am -04:00,Youre right i came to know about RegEx and what it does just yesterday and been trying it out to parse url and it is complex (no success till now)Perhaps ill use it for only clear simple patterns or maybe not,None,0

Sunday September 29th 2013 4:03 am -04:00,My Entry - http://pastebin.com/JkUv5LJLUPDATE 1: Added the File saving functionality - http://pastebin.com/YT7AzE2BI first wanted to use RegEx but figuring out the url string was turning out to be difficult for me so used simple string manipulation.Issues to work in future:1 - To write more clean code.. (At first i think that i did a pretty good job :)  but when i see others code my code starts looking like garbage :/  any tips?)2 - Incorporate https links in the extractor3 - Failsafe system if the user enters invalid url  or other error in accessing page (like Toms exception handling code for invalid urls or invalid page)This program is an URL extracter which extracts the clickable linksfrom the url which is asked by the user.Precondition:1 - valid urls are those which starts which has ahref and http:// tags2 - Only urls that are in the body of the page are extractedCreated By - Ravi R. SharmaUPDATE 1: Added the File saving functionality - http://pastebin.com/YT7AzE2B,None,1
Sunday September 29th 2013 4:46 am -04:00,I will definitely work on my RegEx  skills since it comes pretty handy for string manipulation.As for clean code.. i just want to get better at writing code one good thing i feel about is that im a lot better in writing code than i was before starting of this course!Seriously before this course i knew only basics of python (from codeacademy) but if i wanted to create a program of my own i would start panicking and felt that i couldnt do it. (url extractor creating a program on sieve of Eratosthenes and text based hangman! was not possible with that mindset)This course and weekly challenges helped me alot in confidence and writing code!,None,1

Thursday September 26th 2013 3:05 am -04:00,player_info is a list which means if this list gets updated anywhere(inside or outside of function) it will remain updated everywhere. (Week 5 - Mutability and Aliasing)i guess there is some code in your function that is turning it back to original player_info , Unresolved,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 3:04 am -04:00,one thing that currently comes to my mindIn Python when you print a line which is a combination of str and int you have to first cast int as a stringbut in java you can concatenate strings and int or double or bool with + sign.,None,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 3:11 am -04:00,I started learning programming in Java with SAMS book helped alot in starting but in middle it became somewhat complex(when OOP Swing Started) that i couldnt do more then found various online courses like codeacademy coursera etcI did python and ruby basics from codeacademy and liked python and now finishing LTP course(really enjoyed!)will be taking Rices course on Interactive Programming (in python)My current plan is to stick with python till i make a really nice project/game (web based or GUI based) then move to another language may be C/C++/JavaC - having C skills helps in the embedded systems fieldC++/Java - Mostly Java because of little previous experience.,None,0
Monday September 30th 2013 2:38 pm -04:00,i guess the clock will still be ticking.as the announcement said that you have only 3 hour window to complete the exam from the moment you start it.and you should save the answer after attempting each question. so that you can come back later after getting internet back onall saved answers will be there., Resolved,1
Tuesday October 1st 2013 2:51 am -04:00,Hi...Here is the announcement that instructors provided it has some tips and guidelinesHere are suggestions about what to expect on the exam how to prepare for it and approaches that we think will help you do better on the exam.Unlike the exercises and assignments the exam is not a teaching tool; you should be much faster at the easy stuff than you were a month and a half ago. By now everyone should be comfortable using the Python shell and writing and running very short programs.To study reread all the lecture summaries. Make a list of all the tools that you have learned such as function definition if statements and so on.Make sure you understand the definitions in the Glossary on the Course Wiki:https://share.coursera.org/wiki/index.php/PGM:LTPRedo the exercises. (This cant affect your grade because we take the highest mark out of all your attempts.When you first open the exam read all of it and look for questions you know how to answer right away.We will try to structure the exam so that the first set of questions will be easy and quick and later questions will get progressively harder. The last couple of questions we hope will require some deep thinking and will have you combine the tools youve learned in new ways.Good Luck ! :), Resolved,1
