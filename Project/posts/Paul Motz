Monday September 2nd 2013 5:20 pm -04:00,1) I think it is very important to understand what is going on behind the scenes especially when Python (a pretty high-level language) is being used for the course. Python is great for learning to code since it pretty much enforces proper spacing and is generally easier to start coding simple programs than a language like C. It absolutely matters where values are stored. Most introductory courses go behind the scenes to start out with such as focusing on binary bits bytes and so forth. This course actually dives right into programming moreso than most intro courses Ive seen.2) I kind of agree with you here. I think the documentation is a bit excessive especially for trivial stuff like calculating the area of a triangle. However producing well commented readable code is something that any serious programmer has to be good at. Like others have mentioned the purpose of the function recipe is to create good habits., Resolved,0
