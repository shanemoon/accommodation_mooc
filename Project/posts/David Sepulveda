Saturday August 24th 2013 5:05 pm -04:00,Heres what I think is happening with your computer Kristas.  Your logged into a user account that does not have administrator rights.  You either are on a computer that was set up by someone else who built in an adminstrator account and didnt give you the password or you some how put yourself into an account that only allows you to do certain things.  This can only be resolved with someone who is more advanced with OS and knows all the tricks and triggers to get you out of that mess.  It can get pretty tricky and Im not familiar with OS on a mac so unless someone here can offer you detailed instructions on how to resolve this your only solution is to take it to someone who knows mad OS and can change your account level to make you the administrator.,None,0

Friday August 23rd 2013 12:56 am -04:00,Karina:  a couple of questions....are you saying that you cant type underscore on your mac because your keyboard is defective and the underline key wont work? or is it something more complicated? It would seem to me that if you cant type __ <--that then your keyboard has a problem and the answer would be to get another keyboard. Or is it a communication problem and your looking for a key named underscore...(I wouldnt think so but hey I have to ask you never know), Unresolved,0
Friday August 23rd 2013 1:06 am -04:00,Float refers to the term Floating point intiiger.   Meaning that any number that has numbers after a decimal point.  Example:  1.40  (the .40 is considered a floating point value)  I might not be explain it exactly as defined in Websters but its considered to mean a number less than 1 and expressed in decimal value with a period preceding it.   This definition is coming from memory so it does vary a bit from the technical term.  And my memory is old....so maybe todays definition has changed.  I hope not it would really anger ancient Greek mathematicians.  LOL, Unresolved,1
Friday August 23rd 2013 1:38 am -04:00,Nasharuddin bin Jbin.....Windows is a funny little untolerant monster.....lets start from scratch....These steps may be considered a little elementary for some but its a sure fire way of making sure you get the program and install it.1.  lets look at your securitys setting first.2. start up your control panel (you do this by clicking on the windows task bar left click on the windows logo and then left click on control panel [youll see it on the right side of program GUI].3. Im assuming you have Windows 7 but its the same in windows XP not sure of what it looks like in WIndows 8  Im not familiar with Windows 8 (maybe someone else can guide you to the control panel in Windows 8)4. Look for System and Security < left click > (new screen pops up)5. IN the new screen -look for windows firewall -  (remember these steps because your probably going to have to return to undo the change your about to make)6. <left click> on Allow a program through Windows firewall7. In the list that pops up (scroll down till you find Python(if it is in there then make sure that the little box is checked on (on the left side) then also in the column (home/work(private) make sure its checked off.8. if it isnt there then your security system isnt considering Python a treat or you havent installed it yet.9. If you had to click to put a check on anything then exit the window by clicking on OK at the bottom of the window.10. if you didnt have to make a change then click on CANCEL at the bottom of the window.11. OK now lets download the program. (go to the link given to you by the class instructor)12. since your an x86 system you will be downloading the x86 version of Python....but make sure you save it to yourdrive....(when you click on the download a bar at the bottom of your screen comes up asking you to run or save as  I would recommend to save as.  click on save as.13. before you click on OK make sure you see where the file will be saved too.  You can move the file folders and click on the folders to save the (downloading file) to anywhere you want.  Just remember where you save it.14.  Depending on your internet speed it will then give you a progress percentage reading on that bottom bar in the main screen. ONce its downloaded it will ask you if you want to open it or view the download (I always select view the download)  15....a new window should had opened up if you clicked on view the download.16.  a pull down window next to the name of the file you just downloaded gives you the option to open the containing folder. (open the containing folder)17. here is where it now gets tricky.18. put your cursor over the file in that folder where it is just waiting for you to click on.19. (RIGHT CLICK <<<<<<<(note that its a right side button not the one you always click the other one)20. select run as administrator21 now let it do its thing.22. follow the prompts and you should be ok.Hope this helps if not let me know and Ill help you.David, Unresolved,1

Thursday August 22nd 2013 1:12 pm -04:00,Rukayyatu make sure that your anti-virus program (if running) is turned off (just temporally) while you install the program. Another thing that may be happening is that your download was corrupted while downloading.  Try downloading the program again.Make sure you get the correct copy...if your running a 64bit system like I am. I had to download the 64 bit version of Python., Unresolved,0
