Sunday August 25th 2013 10:18 pm -04:00,If your IP is within mainland china the video will be hosted by CDN network of NetEase the banner of the video player would tell you it is hosted by NetEase.  http://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/183.221.245.14But since the files are missing you may not watch these videos live.In fact Amazon Cloud is not blocked in China right now so the download links are working.Thats why most fellow students of the class will not experience this problem as long as your IP is out of china. Because you are using amazon cloud service. Thats how CDN network works., Resolved,0
