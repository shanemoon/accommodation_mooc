Friday September 27th 2013 5:19 pm -04:00,esosa1. This bit of your code:j <= range (len(asign_grad)+1)is trying to compare two different classes of objects (j being int/float range (len(asign_grad)+1) being a sequence of numbers) that are not really comparable... Think about comparing 3 with 2-4 for example.This is what TypeError: unorderable types: int() <= range() means.2. I visualized your code and got the same error in step 12: http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=def+cal_avg(asign_grad)%3A%0A+%0A+++%23%22%22%22+%0A+++%2...By the way shouldnt the expected average of your list of grades be 85 instead of 80.5? :), Resolved,0

To me it still contains a bit too much stuff :), Resolved,1

But its not displayed under default settings of most text editors.If there was no  at the end of the first sentence Little John was walking in the park both sentences would be printed on the same line in a .txt file.In Notepad++ for example you could see the  character either by using the find function or by enabling View -> Show symbol -> Show end of line. , Unresolved,1

Thats why the for loop stops after iterating through column_index 1.As Anonymous said you need the number of columns. If you look at the representation [[A N T T] [X S O B]] which part(s) of it would be equivalent to the number of columns?, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 2:27 pm -04:00,The whole word search game is supposed to be driven by the other script provided a3_driver.py. This a3_driver.py script opens both the wordlist and the board (take a look at the end of the script) and calls all the functions in a3.py. Thats why you may assume that all files are already open when writing the functions in a3.py., Resolved,0
