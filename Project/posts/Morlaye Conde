Monday September 23rd 2013 5:18 pm -04:00,Hi Jaydipkumar As the hard deadline is over here is how you can use find twice.Here is what python help says:------------------------------------------------------->>> help(str.find)Help on method_descriptor:find(...)    S.find(sub[ start[ end]]) -> int        Return the lowest index in S where substring sub is found    such that sub is contained within S[start:end].  Optional    arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.        Return -1 on failure.-------------------------------------------------------Let say you have two strings str1=pineapple and str2=eThe first occurrence of str2 in str1 would be:>>> str1.find(str2)33 is the index of the first e in str1.The second (after the first) occurrence of str2 in str1 would be:>>> str1.find(str2str1.find(str2)+1)88 is the index of the second e in pineapple.Notice that you are counting after the first (3+1) occurrence.What if you needed a third occurrence? Same logic. now str1=RedPineapple and  str2=eFirst occurrence>>> str1.find(str2)1Second occurrence>>> str1.find(str2str1.find(str2)+1)6Third occurrence>>> str1.find(str2str1.find(str2str1.find(str2)+1)+1)11The third part could have been more elegant but DONT do +2 (1+1). As you can see in RedPineapple  e is at the first (index starts with zer0) sixth and eleventh index in str1. Hope that helps. , Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 10:42 pm -04:00,You should get the result in one line. You dont need the loop., Resolved,2
Monday September 16th 2013 10:39 pm -04:00,You are returning each complement in dna instead of concatenating them. , Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 2:56 pm -04:00,Is your get_complement() function working?  Why are you adding get_complement(blah) and blah? , Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 4:45 pm -04:00,Alvaro If you are using a FOR statement I dont think you need x=x+1 to solve this problem.If you are using a WHILE loop it may help you. I dont see its usage for this exercise. , Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 1:31 pm -04:00,The and part in incomplete. , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 1:56 pm -04:00,A help(range) gives you this :range(start stop[ step]) -> range object |   |  Returns a virtual sequence of numbers from start to stop by step.for i in range(1523105042) will gives you 1523 1525 1527 .... 10503.Notice that stop is 10504 because 10503 has to be inclusive. Hope this helps. , Unresolved,7
Tuesday September 17th 2013 2:50 pm -04:00,How to do you sum this range without using FOR or WHILE?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 3:01 pm -04:00,That would give the answer but the idea of using FOR or WHILE is to avoid typing all that range in the sum function. Think about if you had a range of (15231002003004003) for example. You cant type all those values., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 3:14 pm -04:00,As Tom said sum(range(2102)) would work but I think the instructor wanted us to practice FOR and WHILE statements. Hint: write a while loop to accumulate the sum and print it. Then copy and paste that sum. For maximum learning do it with a for loop as well using range., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 11:43 pm -04:00,Thats right.They are just asking the sum NOT the code. If your answer is 50 for instance as mentinned above the only thing you need to copy and paste is : 50, Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 2:22 am -04:00,If you also had a variable >>> s=an exampleyou could call the help like this: >>> help(s.strip), Unresolved,2
Thursday September 26th 2013 12:05 pm -04:00,First you need to read each line and put the result in a list [EFJA]BEFORE ready the next line put the result of the previous line in a list [ [EFJA]]You need two list  the inner for each line and the outer for the board., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 12:34 pm -04:00,Try using append to form your inner list. , Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 11:48 pm -04:00,When testing in IDLE you can open the file the see the result. But when submitting your assignment no file name should be included ( that is done by a3_driver.py)., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 4:26 pm -04:00,This function shouldnt return something.  ([str int] list str) -> NoneType ..., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 11:34 pm -04:00,As Tom said you have 2 parameters in this functions:is_valid_word(wordlistword)wordlist is something like this : [word1word2word3]. You are checking if word is in wordlist. Week 4 lecture can help you accomplish this. , Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 11:41 pm -04:00,What does your function return when you run this?>>> make_str_from_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]] 3), Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 1:29 am -04:00,Thats right. I am not sure why you are getting that error. If you give more info about your code that may help to troobleshoot the error. , Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 1:45 am -04:00,Sorry Gerardo I missed this part in your previous post :  (len(board[0])) instead of (len(board[0])-1)Any reason you are using [0]?What is the output of your function when you run this? make_str_from_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]  [X S O B] [X S O B]] 3), Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 2:20 am -04:00,As you dont know many sub-lists you will get (could be 1 20 100 etc..)  you should use a loop to get the string at the column_index of each of them. Then add them up. In this case for instance you have only 4 sub-lists and column_index=3.You get the character at index 3 of in each sub-list and concatenate it to the next.>>> make_str_from_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]  [X S O B] [X S O B]] 3)TBBBI will be back in 10 hours. Good luck., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 2:24 am -04:00,See my previous post and watch this lecture again. It may help you https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/lecture/82, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 11:27 am -04:00,Oliver I solved this problem without nested loop. I used two lists:String_list to create a list for each line Board_list to create a list of String_list. Every time you finish reading a line you set String_list =hope that helps. , Resolved,2
Thursday September 26th 2013 12:31 pm -04:00,thats right. You just have to initialize (String_list =) AFTER you read the next line.  , Resolved,2
Thursday September 26th 2013 1:07 pm -04:00,oliver You are right. You need a while loop to move through each line. When i said I didnt use nested loop I was talking about [i][j]. sorry  I should have stated in an better way. , Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 1:21 pm -04:00,Wendy I think it is testing different scenarios. Maybe the one with wordlist1 and board1 is working but not other scenarios. , Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 9:10 am -04:00,Luca check this videos how to read line and while loophttps://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/lecture/84, Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 11:21 am -04:00,before you use the while loop you need to define line first. Are you doing that?, Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 1:43 pm -04:00,Luca Let say my file content looks like this :FIRST LINESECOND LINETHIRD LINE When you open  the file The first file.readline() returns FIRST LINEthe 2nd file.readline() returns SECOND LINEthe 3rd file.readline() returns THIRD LINE The next file.readline()  will return empty string (). that means you have reached the end of your file.The ONLY time you get  is when you have finished reading the last line.while line !=    means read everything (including the last line). You tell the loop to stop there otherwise it will return anoter  , Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 12:12 pm -04:00,I dont know where your file is saved but you can try this. copy your file on the C drive>>> file=open(c:/wordlist1.txt r) or >>> file=open(c:\\wordlist1.txt r)>>> file.read()>>> file.close(), Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 4:34 pm -04:00,where is wordlist1.txt stored?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 5:39 pm -04:00,If you launch IDLE from the start menu and type words_file = open(wordlist1.txt r)  that would not work unless worslist.txt is saved on C:\Program Files\Python33\ or wherever resides python installation. If you save a3.py and wordlist1 in the same directory Close IDLE > right click on a3.py > Edit with IDLE. Then go at the menu bar RUN > RUN MODULE and it will open IDLE shell. If you type words_file = open(wordlist1.txt r)  it would work.finally regarless where you save the text file you can always type this : words_file = open(C:\Your_Path_To_File\wordlist1.txt r) and it should work. Assuming that it is on your C drive just replace Your_Path_To_File. You may have to replace \ by / or \\., Resolved,2

Thursday October 3rd 2013 10:37 pm -04:00,Hi Inhoo I am not sure if I understand your question correctly but here is what you can do. If you type this: >>> dir (__builtins__)You will see all builtin functions (includinding list). Notice __ in 2 underscores put together( _ _ ).Now if call the help for list you will see all methods belonging to list.>>> help(list)In order to see the help for each method you have to type help(list.METHOD_NAME). For example>>> help(list.pop)>>> help(list.insert)Another way to do this if you already have a list is to use that list name. For example:>>> myList=[12ab]>>> help(myList.append), Unresolved,0
