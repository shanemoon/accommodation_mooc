Wednesday August 28th 2013 5:02 pm -04:00,Alo ekipo ja sam iz Croatia-e! Šta ima?!? Btw. meni je ovaj drugi tjedan vec ok dok sam prvi mislio zasto sam uopce krenuo s tim debilizmom ali počelo mi se sviđat sa množenjem stringova(matematički tip obrade). Jedino mi malo smeta šta koristimo suck IDLE jer sam radio nešto sitno s Javom u Eclipse-u - i ful je kul prema ovom IDLE-u! Inače ja sam ovo upisao samo kako bi imao potvrdu da sam položio tečaj programiranja u bilo kakvom jeziku(na kraju krajeva svi se svode na isti princip). A za baze podataka me također interesira nadam se da su pitanja vezana za baze dobrodošla?Baš mi je drago da se našlo par balkanaca na ovom tečaju. Uživajte! Do pisanja!,None,1

Sunday September 1st 2013 6:50 pm -04:00,I have the same issue as Sarah had above Im getting 29.0 for:time_to_utc(-11 18.0)I tried just adding the negative form of the utc_offset variable but its just not working so obviously you cant just add it to it. The problems always result when I start using the negative values for the utc_offset variable, Unresolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 8:17 pm -04:00,HelloI was wondering if we should write code to block the user from inserting letters that do not match the typical ATGC format like required in the is_valid_sequence function within the same assignment?I was just going to insert a blank character with no space to neglect the fact that the user even inserted anything into the function because they neglected to abide by basic DNA base pair guidelines and by doing so simply just output the original DNA sequence they entered.I didnt know if implementing this code would dock me points but I just want to be sure., Unresolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 8:49 pm -04:00,Oh okay so it was safe to assume that the user would insert normal base pairs and indexing great!Jose I was talking about the Insert_sequence function not the valid_sequence function by the way.Either way good to know thanks for the help guys!I think Ill just comment the safe guards out for use at a later date then its still pretty cool regardless., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 11:21 am -04:00,The function in the quiz was at follows:def mystery(lst):    for sublist in lst:        total = 0        for num in sublist:            total = total + num    return totalprint(mystery([[10 20] [20] [40 10]]))How was the answer equal to 50? Wouldnt this function add 30 plus 20 plus 50 to get a total of 100 instead?Just wanted to ask for clarification in terms of understanding what the function is actually doing, Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 1:54 pm -04:00,HelloSo I replicated the a1 .txt file that the professor displayed in the beginning of the video and played it in my C:\Python Programs folderIf I want to open it up using the Read_grades() function how would I specify that particular file in the function call?I tried Read_grades(a1.txt) but Python is giving me a str has no attribute error, Unresolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 12:39 pm -04:00,I am been trying to fix my Read_board function for the past couple days and cant understand what half of these errors are regarding:student: test_a3.Test_02_ReadBoard.test_01_return_typeERROR	student: test_a3.Test_02_ReadBoard.test_02_square_symmetric_boardERROR	student: test_a3.Test_02_ReadBoard.test_03_rectangular_assymetric_boardERROR	student: test_a3.Test_02_ReadBoard.test_03_square_assymetric_boardHere is my code thus far:def read_board(board_file):     (file open for reading) -> list of list of str    Return a board read from open file board_file. The board file will contain    one row of the board per line. Newlines are not included in the board.        board_file = open(board_file r)    line = board_file.readline()    # This will assign a line to the current read    while line != :        # This is a while loop that will continue as long as there are no        # blank characters        line = line.rstrip()        line = print(line end = )        return line        line = board_file.readline()    # Status: WORK ON THISHere is the text file I attempt to open aka boardexs.txt that contains the following words in a column list format:TOP CAR FIX MAG COLWhen I actually run the function all I receive is the word TOP. What are the errors even referring to? What are square and rectangle boards in this context?, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 12:49 pm -04:00,Two things how do I implement the accumulator? Are you saying to implement a string that will keep concatenating the current line to itself?Also by deleting the open file line at the top of my code how am I going to even check if this works?Should I just have the Notepad text file open already and Python automatically knows to open it if its in the same folder as my programs?, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 12:50 pm -04:00,This is my revised code thus far though I have no way of checking if this works if I cant actually open my boardsex.txt file... so I really dont get how we are supposed to check if this works.Heres my code:def read_board(board_file):     (file open for reading) -> list of list of str    Return a board read from open file board_file. The board file will contain    one row of the board per line. Newlines are not included in the board.        # board_file = open(board_file r)    total =     line = board_file.readline()    # This will assign a line to the current read    while line != :        # This is a while loop that will continue as long as there are no        # blank characters        line = line.rstrip()        words_list =         words_list.append(line)        line = board_file.readline()    return line, Unresolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 11:46 am -04:00,All I get is a blank line within the Python interpreter if I use: read_board(open(board_file r))aka:  is all that shows up as the output for the Python interpreter, Unresolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 11:59 am -04:00,Would this code work?:I tried returning the words_list instead which managed to give me one of the words in question but not the entire list.If you happen to think I should use a for loop can you give me an example because I dont think a  For word in words_list: kind of loop would work in this situation so I have no idea what you guys are talking about when I should put in a for loop.The question is: Where?Anyway heres my code:def read_board(board_file):     (file open for reading) -> list of list of str    Return a board read from open file board_file. The board file will contain    one row of the board per line. Newlines are not included in the board.        board_file = open(board_file r)    total =     line = board_file.readline()    # This will assign a line to the current read    while line != :        # This is a while loop that will continue as long as there are no        # blank characters        line = line.rstrip()        words_list =         words_list.append(line)        line = board_file.readline()    return words_list, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 1:03 pm -04:00,Everything Im doing seems to make sense so far but its just that I dont necessarily know why my function is failing for the example that was given since it only gives 2 words instead of 3 apparently.Heres my code thus far please let me know where Im going wrong:def num_words_on_board(board words):     (list of list of str list of str) -> int    Return how many words appear on board.    >>> num_words_on_board([[A N T T] [X S O B]] [ANT BOX SOB TO])    3        num_words = 0    for x in range(len(board)):        # This will search through the entire length of the board        if board_contains_word(boardwords) == True:            # This will pass the board to the board_contains function to see            # if in fact it IS a word            num_words = num_words + 1    return num_words, Unresolved,0

Friday October 4th 2013 1:07 pm -04:00,HelloIm having trouble with the return type for my function apparently due to the error listed on the assignment.My code pretty much does what is required for the function. I dont know where Im going wrong.Heres my code:def update_score(player_info word):     ([str int] list str) -> NoneType    player_info is a list with the players name and score. Update player_info    by adding the point value word earns to the players score.    >>> update_score([Jonathan 4] ANT)        player_info[1] += word_score(word)    return(player_info)    # This will just reference the word score function with the new word    # which will then just take in the new word to have its number of    # characters analyzed    # I first need to fix Word Score for this to work    # Status: Complete because by adding the default example it added    # 3 points to the total when I used a test print() at the end    # of the function, Unresolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 11:48 am -04:00,Ah okay I guess I used that line as a fail safe to check if it works and forgot to delete it.Thanks a bunch!, Unresolved,0
