Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:06 am -04:00,Hiya I also have a question about dir.So for example if I have a string:string = HIand then I want to see how to use the function that would return the string in a lowercase I would say:string.lower(help)When this comes up the last line of the help is END with a white font on a black background. But it seems the only way I can return from the help menu to the command line is to cancel out of python and go back into python.What buttons on the keyboard do I press to say Thanks for the help return to command line without closing down python completelyThanksÂ , Resolved,0
