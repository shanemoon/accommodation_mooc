Thursday August 22nd 2013 12:43 am -04:00,Hello  I am somewhat a beginner but do have some know how about the basics so I am asking a question that popped up in my mind during this lecture. In this lecture it is said that if we assign a new value to an existing variable the connection to the old memory address is cut and a it then points to the memory address of the new value.My question is does it mean that when we assign new value to an existing variable does only the reference is cut to the old memory address and the value in that old memory address still exists? if thats the case isnt it wastage of memory? Or I read somewhere about something called garbage collector...so does that come into play?Thanks., Resolved,0

Tuesday August 27th 2013 4:36 pm -04:00,I am here because I had the same question in my mind. As far as the click button is concerned there is no way to do it since when we click on Quiz button a new tab opens with a PDF opened. So the submit button is not clickable by anymeans. Anyhelp ?, Resolved,0

Wednesday September 4th 2013 6:28 am -04:00,Thank you. But I wanted to test it one last time before submitting it. So If I get 12.0 when I enter time_from_utc(+0 12.0) does it mean everything is perfect? I have tested other examples which were given as well and they showed the expected result.Thanks, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 6:33 am -04:00,One more thing in hour_difference everything shows perfect but for this: >>> hours_difference(1800.0 2160.0) I get 0.09999999999999998 instead of exact 0.1 is it acceptable? because int division is not appropriate either because it rounds off even 0.5 to 1.thanks, Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 4th 2013 3:49 pm -04:00,I am no expert so sorry if I dont clarify it good enough but i am gonna try.when u call to_24_hour_clock in return statement of the to_utc function you have to give argument as well to the to_24_hour_clock call i.e. to_24_hour_clock(argument). From the error hours not defined I am guessing you are not giving any argument to the function. The header and docstrings are in the starter code. Use those examples to determine the appropriate formula. that formula will be put inside the to_24_hour_clock() function as an argument., Unresolved,0
