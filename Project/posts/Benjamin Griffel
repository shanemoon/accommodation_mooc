Monday August 19th 2013 8:00 pm -04:00,I am answering this to the best of my knowledge but I am not an expert.  As far as the example is concerned the ID numbers are arbitrary but in real computer systems some memory addresses are taken up by the operating system and cannot be used so not every memory address is available. , Resolved,1
Wednesday August 21st 2013 11:34 am -04:00,I am just curious about why you chose to talk about writing and defining your own function before first discussing writing a simple script file.  In other programming languages the typical order to first write a simple program that doesnt need a function and then move on from there., Unresolved,0
Thursday August 22nd 2013 10:05 am -04:00,There are pros and cons to  both strategies but I have a friend taking this class who seemed confused about why you need functions in the first place.  I think a little more context would be helpful., Unresolved,2
Thursday August 29th 2013 2:47 pm -04:00,I do think that the motivation for each function that is how the functions are actually used in the gui program should be made more clear.  Also I know it must take a lot of time and advanced planning to do these online courses but I hope that the profs can take some time to address students concerns.  , Unresolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 5:20 pm -04:00,Margie   I think the key to this assignment is to not overthink the problems and to read the directions carefully.  There were a few steps I missed by not reading carefully enough.  Each function shouldnt need more than a few lines of code (more than three and you are probably off track) .  It was much harder to figure out exactly what they were looking for than writing the code itself., Unresolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 11:13 am -04:00,For these simple function figuring out what the function is supposed to do from the docstring isnt so hard but I hope int he future we have more to go on than that when we are working on more complex functions., Unresolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 10:21 am -04:00,I think it needs to be made more clear somewhere that running a script file tells Python to execute every line in the script and just loads the functions into memory and that this is not the same as running the functions themselves., Resolved,1

Wednesday September 25th 2013 5:53 pm -04:00,it was nice to see he included those errors they were easy to make.  This lecture also shows how you can really build a complicated program from a few simple steps., Unresolved,2

Monday September 30th 2013 8:08 am -04:00,1)  The output format for read_words (the format that need words need to return) is the same as expected as the input for is_valid_word2)  theoutput format for read_board is the same as the input expected for make_str_from_column3)  use a3_driver.py as a quick way to test your code.  It wont run correctly if your code isnt working but you can use it as a way to try to stop mistakes., Unresolved,1
