Tuesday August 20th 2013 4:43 am -04:00,Hi Tatiana. Open a terminal wait for the prompt then type in/paste the command. Do you already have Python 3 installed? If not I believe you have to typeÂ  sudo yum install python3first. Thats what I did. If you are running Fedora 18 with Gnome GUI open the terminal by going to applications system tools then terminal. Other GUIs/desktops will probably be very similar.I am also brand new to Linux. You are not alone., Resolved,0
