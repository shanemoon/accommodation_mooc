Thursday August 22nd 2013 5:57 am -04:00,But this is a really bad habit if you want to make an easy-to-read code.,None,1
Thursday August 22nd 2013 9:12 am -04:00,As this course is made to teach the basics of computer programming I think its quite a good idea to start with functions before writting a full script.Learning functions may help a lot of people think of the structure of their code and avoid the all in the main syndrom., Unresolved,2
Thursday August 22nd 2013 2:21 am -04:00,Indeed python uses a garbage collector.When you assign a new value to an existing variable the reference is changed. The old one is deleted by the garbage collector if it is not needed (e.g. referenced) by any variable anymore., Resolved,8
Thursday August 22nd 2013 5:47 am -04:00,The thing is in the language syntax you have to right it like : variable = valueYou cant change the value of a digit and say from now on thou shalt be known as x.So x = 8 is a valid statement (x stores 8)and 8 = x is invalid (you cant change 8)The second reason why it may raise a Syntax error instead of a name error is because of the way a compiler works. Its a bit more advanced but to sum up before running the program the compiler has to understand your sentence. First of all it will check if the word order is correct before checking if it makes sense.First it will check if the sentence is in the form variable = value or variable = variableif this is incorrect it will raise a syntax error.If it is correct it will next check if the variables are known.if you write x = y the compiler will ask himself Do I know y? if it doesnt it will raise a name error.I hope this will help you a little.,None,7
Thursday August 22nd 2013 10:41 am -04:00,The problem is as the error says that the name banana is not defined.First the compiler checks the structure of the code: variable = variable is a valid statement so no syntax error.Then he cheks if he knows banana. He couldnt find it so he raises an error saying you told me to use banana but I dont know that!,None,0
Thursday August 22nd 2013 9:17 am -04:00,Dont forget the // operator is used for integer divisions.7 // 5 will end up with a result of 1 while youre waiting for 1.4the operator for a full division is just /But because of python specifications if you write 7 / 5 the shell will give you 1 as answer which is of course not what you expect. You can have the floating point result by 7 / 5.0 for instance.If you use python 3 dividing using 7 / 5 will give you 1.4Actually David if you use 7.0//5.0 with python 3 it will just end up with 1.0, Unresolved,0
