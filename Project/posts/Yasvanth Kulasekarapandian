Wednesday August 21st 2013 2:30 pm -04:00,Hi everyone I just registered for the course today. I understand the course started 2 days ago and I received an email upon registering informing me that I might not be able to earn a Statement of Accomplishment. I was wondering if anybody could let me know if I can still earn one. I am taking this course as a way to strengthen my profile for a Bioinformatics program I wish to join and it is vital that I receive such a Statement.,None,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 5:19 pm -04:00,Hey Jeannie that usually is the error message given if the module containing the defined area function isnt running. Try and make sure the triangle.py module is running and that the shell restarts as you run the module. I was personally having the same problem as Rizwan. I am able to see the call tip window pop up if I manually go under edit and select it each time but it is not prompting automatically as it should after using the help function to explain area. It might have to do with Win 8 / compatibility but I honestly have no idea. Thanks Yesh., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 7:28 pm -04:00,I am having the same exact problem Ive double checked spellings on everything and tested out multiple sequences and it works in the shell. For some reason it says failure when submitted: here is my code:def get_complementary_sequence(seq):        (str) -> str    Return the complementary sequence for sequence seq.    >>> get_complementary_sequence(ATCG)    TAGC    >>> get_complementary_sequence(ATCGGCTA)    TAGCCGAT            c =     for char in seq:        if char is A: c = c + T        elif char is T: c = c + A        elif char is C: c = c + G        elif char is G: c = c + C    return c, Unresolved,0
