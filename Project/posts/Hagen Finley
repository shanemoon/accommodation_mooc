Saturday August 31st 2013 8:15 pm -04:00,I am having similar problems. My get_hours get_minutes & get seconds functions work properly using my Ubuntu Linux python 3.3.1 shell. However  when I submit them they all fail - in fact none of my functions pass even though they pass all the test examples you provided when executed in the shell. I am using gedit in Ubuntu as my editor. I am still working on the utc functions and float functions so I expected those to fail. The return statements in the functions are fairly simple so its hard to see what would be causing the problem. The ERROR I am getting is:Message:ERROR: SyntaxErrorunexpected character after line continuation character(./a1.py 52 51     return hours + (minutes \\ 60) + (seconds \\ 60)), Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 9:14 pm -04:00,Yes that seems to be source of the error - I am getting the appropriate SUCCESS reports now for the functions that worked on the command line. Thanks!I also think I was misreading the summary versus mid-summary versus failed ... output  (when you pick failed all you see is failed ;-), Resolved,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 3:27 pm -04:00,One of the examples for the to_float_hours function is:>>> to_float_hours(2 45 9)    2.7525However 9 seconds is actually 15% of 60 seconds so wouldnt the correct output be 2.7515?Thats the output my function returns so I am a little biased ;-). Am I misunderstanding the task?, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 3:34 pm -04:00,All of the submittal tests for the time_to_utc function are failing with the same error:Method Description:Test what happens when all components of the times are 0.Message:ERROR: TypeErrorunsupported operand type(s) for -: NoneType and intI am getting the correct output in the shell per the tests provided in the instructions. I am also a bit confused about the precondition:Precondition: 0 <= minutes < 60  and  0 <= seconds < 60The submittal test tests for some or all of the parameters being 0 and I can address 0 parameters using conditional logic but the task is supposed to be achievable without resorting to conditional logic. Am I supposed to code the precondition?, Unresolved,0
