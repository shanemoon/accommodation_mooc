Friday October 4th 2013 3:32 pm -04:00,Dear AnneTry to think in the following way:You have two types of lists;1 )list1    list2        when you read file    list3    list42)list=[[list1][list2][list3][list4]]   when you finish the readingSo you need two assistive lists; first for rows list_i =  and second for board list = . Both are initially empty. Now we need to first fill out the first list_i=list1. You need only one loop - while - for reading entire list_i (i = 1234) and one loop - for - for reading each element of the list_i . Try this in IDLE in order to see how to build a list of list str:    >>> list=>>> list1= [ab]>>> list.append(list1)>>> list1= [cd]>>> list.append(list1)Now look at list>>> list[[a b] [c d]]This is what you need..., Resolved,0
