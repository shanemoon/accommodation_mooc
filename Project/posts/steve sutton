Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:33 am -04:00,I am having trouble figuring out the mathematical process for  hours_difference problem on the assignment. I know its a simple mistake i am making. I can tell I have over complicated it after reading your  posts. Please point me in the right direction for witch operator to use. -edit- I looked at it with fresh eyes this morning it took about 10 min for me to re-work this problem correctly and that was before my coffee. :)               Thank you for your time and help Jose!, Unresolved,0
