Monday September 2nd 2013 6:21 pm -04:00,Im writing this in hopes of helping anyone out there who made the same stupid mistake I did.I wrote my functions for step 5 submitted the assignment so far and got a bunch of errors. I checked and rechecked my math and it worked so I couldnt figure out why I got errors. Ive been searching the forum for over 45 minutes. Finally I lookedback at my functions and noticed that I named them to_hours instead of get_hours to_minutes instead of get_minutes and to_seconds instead of get_seconds. All the correct code in the world wont work if you dont use the function names provided in theassignment!, Unresolved,1
