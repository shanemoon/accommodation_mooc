Monday August 19th 2013 2:26 pm -04:00,Just to be technically correct it isnt a firewall that is causing this problem; firewalls control TCP/IP traffic and processes dont communicate via TCP/IP. However many security suites (often commonly called firewalls) have firewall modules plus other modules that control  processes/programs running on the PC and its one of the latter that needs to be configured to allow the pythonw.exe process to do its job. As posted elsewhere its not a good idea to disable a (real) firewall to solve a problem (though disabling the whole security suite or one of its modules temporarily to troubleshoot an issue is a valid approach)., Resolved,2

Paul discusses this in his lecture; in my experience its one of the great gotchas when you start to learn programming and had me tearing my hair out lots of times in my early days![Edit] In a sense thats what user-defined functions are for to create formula or relationships that persist as variables change.

Monday August 26th 2013 10:34 am -04:00,Hi Cameron. It wont be a firewall (properly so called) that is causing the problem however it might be a component of a security suite (sometimes erroneously marketed as firewalls). Do you have a security suite installed on your PC? If so what?Some security suites have components that monitor what processes are running on PCs and block unfamiliar ones. If you have such a suite you need to trust or allow (or somesuch) the process pythonw.exe.This has been discussed before (though rather inconclusively!): https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=66, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 7:26 am -04:00,Hi Cameron I deduce from the fact that you dont know if you have security software installed that you are either using a PC someone else has set up or you are not very IT-savvy.There appears to be no obvious answer to your problem but there are two approaches:1. Try and find out if there is some security suite module blocking this sub-process being called or2. Do a thorough uninstall and re-install of Python in the hope that something went wrong the first time round (not unusual - happened to me!) and wont happen after a re-install.Personally I think the second approach is the best but doing a thorough uninstall is a bit more complicated than just running the (windows) uninstaller; a few things will need to be deleted manually.

Monday September 2nd 2013 12:57 pm -04:00,If you havent specifically added any Javascript blocker its unlikely that is the problem; Javascript is probably enabled by default in Chrome.There should be a three horizontal bars icon near the top right corner of the Chrome window; clicking on that gives you a menu one of the items of which is Settings. Clicking that should get you to the Settings page theres an Extensions option in the left-hand menu so you can see if theres anything there (like Notscripts) thats getting in the way.Otherwise go back to Settings click Advanced Settings at the bottom; Privacy Content Settings gives you access to the main Javascript controls.Sorry I cant shed any more light on this.

Saturday September 7th 2013 4:56 am -04:00,Again Jorge Im not quite sure what you mean. There might be two things.01. You are using Chrome browser on Windows 8: Jen and Paul (I believe) are using Safari browser on Mac OS X 10.7.The options available to you in the browser toolbar will therefore differ. I am not a great fan of Chrome precisely because (whatever its other merits) its user interface is not very configurable. I use Firefox but you could try Safari for Windows; download it from here: http://download.cnet.com/Apple-Safari/3000-2356_4-10697481.htmlJust be patient/careful with the download and installation; dont click on any other links apart from the main download one or accept any of the other free software possibly offered as options with the main install.02. The other issue (though it doesnt affect how the Visualizer appears) is that the Mac version of IDLE differs in a number of respects from the Windows version; so Jen and Paul can do things from the IDLEGUI (shell) you cant do; but you can do them from a new (editor) window that you open., Unresolved,0

Yannick appears to have edited his earlier post to remove the incorrect code (which he did not need to do; it was incorrect!)The post I deleted (which only staff can now see) contains a statement of the correct code; this is an Honor Code violation.

Thursday September 19th 2013 3:54 am -04:00,nucleo should be a single character string not a multi-character string. If you are calling the function with multi-character strings the if conditions are never met (never true).[Edit] The purpose is just to get the complement of one nucleotide; the example in your function definition is wrong. It should be eg>>> get_nucleotide(A)>>> TOnce youve got a working get_nucleotide function you can use it in the get_complementary_sequence function definition which is what your example relates to., Resolved,2

Thursday September 19th 2013 9:44 am -04:00,BTW there are several approaches to this problem that will yield the right answer(s).

Sunday September 22nd 2013 4:36 am -04:00,I am beginning to suspect that a small but significant number of problems students are having with IDLE arise from not restarting IDLE (Shell > Restart Shell) after running code snippets; they work wrongly because there are legacy variables set in memory that influence the output. These variables of course will not be set on Courseras test server!A typical case might be when you have initialised (at zero or an empty string) an accumulator; if you do not reset this explicitly or clear it by a restart the accumulated result might be carried forward in a next run of the operative code.Note that if you restart IDLE the memory of lines of code you have entered is not lost so you can recall your code snippets via (eg in Windows) the Alt + P key combination.I am in the habit of always restarting IDLE before retesting code (and indeed explicitly re-indenting code when I copy and paste it between IDLE the edit window the visualizer or off a web page - the other major issue that appears to cause a lot of these it works in IDLE but not when I submit problems.), Resolved,3

Saturday September 21st 2013 3:07 pm -04:00,Aha! (stopped after 300 steps to prevent possible infinite loop)I guess thats a limitation of the Visualizer not a comment on the code! (Didnt know that never came across it before!), Unresolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 3:39 pm -04:00,Just a thought; are you copying and pasting code straight into IDLE eg from the visualizer and then hitting Enter? That wouid give you a SyntaxError: multiple statements found while compiling a single statement, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 9:17 am -04:00,Another thought (triggered by your typed too much crap comment!) its come up in a different thread Ive been involved with: its a good idea to restart IDLE (via Menu item: Shell > Restart Shell) before retesting code to prevent possible legacy variables stored in memory influencing the new output.See https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2323, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 2:02 pm -04:00,I think you may be conflating somewhat get_complement() and get_complementary_sequence. The first returns eg T for A and is called with a single-character string.The latter can use get_complement() to iterate through a multi-character string returning and accumulating the single characters into a multi-character string of the complements and return that.Or have I misunderstood?, Resolved,0

Thursday October 3rd 2013 8:10 am -04:00,A for loop is designed to iterate over every item in the object it operates on; in this case a list of lists (or sublists) and in the sublists a list of numbers.It doesnt matter what you call the item to look for as long as you are consistent; it could have been:for thingy1 in lst     for thingy2 in thingy1          total = total + thingy2But sublist and num are good meaningful names because they describe what the objects being iterated over are., Unresolved,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 2:33 pm -04:00,Found on the internet: Since tuples are immutable you dont have to worry about side effects.  If you call a function and pass it a list you have no guarantee that the list wont be changed during the function call.  With tuples any attempt to change the tuple will raise an exception.  If it is important to the caller that the sequence remain unchanged then a tuple is a safer representation for that sequence., Resolved,1

Thursday October 3rd 2013 12:02 pm -04:00,Zinia I believe its to do with the way exercises as opposed to assignments are (automatically) marked.With the latter if your code yields the right answer(s) it is marked as correct no matter how convoluted the code might be.With the former it is looking for the correct expression eg most simple or efficient.

You start with an empty outer list.For each line you want to strip the newline character then chop the line into a list of characters (an inner for loop) and insert them into an inner list. You start with an empty inner list.For each iteration of the outer loop. you want to append the inner list into the outer list then clear the inner list in preparation for the next run of the outer loop.Try and express that in Python and post back., Unresolved,0
