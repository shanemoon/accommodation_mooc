Tuesday September 10th 2013 1:45 pm -04:00,Hi guysget_hours is the only function that when submitted gives me back 6 failures but when I test it works as needed.I return the predefined 24 function which wraps get_hours parameter // seconds in hour. I get values only from 0 - 23 with small and large numbers. Thanks, Unresolved,0
