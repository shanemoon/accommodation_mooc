Tuesday August 20th 2013 12:45 pm -04:00,I dont see any problem on your original question Sir Gries. In the given expression division will be performed first so it will not satisfy your order requirement of +-/; So we need to introduce parenthesis. Put one to group the addition and another to group the subtraction yields to your required order of operations.  I guess the rewrite word mislead some to think of re-shuffling the given; Yes that one might be clearer., Resolved,2
Tuesday August 20th 2013 11:55 am -04:00,yeah i also answered the first one and I wandered why it was incorrect. Then I realized there is still another incorrect expression so i selected two. , Resolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 9:03 pm -04:00,I agree with Wei it is really confusing. I too selected 2 choices the at least one and the student passed some but not all. However after reviewing the question they did not put an s on the which of the english sentence so meaning there is only 1 correct answer and best answer is the at least one because it is an or statement. I think this is a TRICK question.   , Unresolved,0

Friday October 4th 2013 4:44 am -04:00,do the same for your make_str_from_column except that you dont need an index in the for loop put the index in the char you add in the accumulator in your codes case you use st2st2=st2+i[column_index], Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 4:58 am -04:00,For board_contains_word_in_row function do not change anything from the starter code a3.py you downloaded. The codes provided there are already correct and working.For board_contains_word_in_column review  board_contains_word_in_row function.  It is basically the same. for loop   # but put an index on your board here [0]   if statement       returnreturnI hope these helps..., Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 5:06 am -04:00,Just concentrate and try to run your code in idle with the examples given and add some more. If it doesnt work the error will give you a clue on what is wrong... if you dont know post the error. I also ask for explanations from helpful experts in the forum for my 2 non-working functions and thanks to Tom Enos and Vadim it is working now.I suggest you read the threads discussing each function problems in details.... i did the same and I survived.... Just keep on working!, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 5:10 am -04:00,Sorry but your post was deleted already just post it on related threads (and dont post it in full ask questions or seek explanations) im sure there are others who will help... gtg for now, Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 4:57 am -04:00,I cant get my code to work. I tried to reuse the board_contains_word code.

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 8:13 pm -04:00,Thanks Adrian for responding... you are right i overlooked my for word in... i already replaced it... but still it returned errors. Yup my accumulator is num_words=num_words+1 I changed it to narrative style because of the honor code (this is my first course to take) but looking at the other posts maybe I can post some exact codes too. I still have 3 functions to do besides this one. Please bear with me. Thanks again, Unresolved,0
