Wednesday September 11th 2013 6:07 am -04:00,Going to sleep now but maybe someone generous can help me out here.student: test_time_to_utc.TestTimeToUTC.test_minutes_nonzeroFAILURE[x]Method Description:Test time zones that are not on the hour.Message:FAILURE: AssertionError21.5 != 21.3 within 7 placesIs the last error message my program is generating. I think I misunderstood something because I did it based on the assumption if a time_to_utc(1.5 12) was inputed it would subtract the 1.5 from 12 and then convert that time to a utc+0 time(with my understanding that .5 would just be half an hour). Somehow Im slightly off., Resolved,0
