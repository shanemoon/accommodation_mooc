Monday September 16th 2013 4:27 pm -04:00,Hi JonathanI am getting the following 3 errors although my code works just fine. It returns an empty string if the argument was an empty string. It returns the correct complement of the example in the handout and it works fine with a sequence that has multiple occurrence of a nucleotide. Please advise!!!student: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_emptystudent: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_handout_examplestudent: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_long, Resolved,1
