Tuesday September 3rd 2013 5:59 am -04:00,Hi please explain why 3 + - 4 is a valid combination. Maybe the numbers are not right but after completing the video and the quizz in it I can watch it anymore so I dont remember exactly the numbers. The question is why a syntax with two different operators and no parenthesis is valid.Thanks a lot, Unresolved,0
