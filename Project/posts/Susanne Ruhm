Saturday August 31st 2013 8:35 am -04:00,As far as I can see your function wouldnt work for something like>>>get_hours(3800)which should give you 1.You need to get rid of additional seconds which dont amount to a full hour., Resolved,2
Saturday September 14th 2013 3:17 am -04:00,Please consider that the return type of the function is_valid_sequence should be bool. That leaves us with only one possibility for non-valid-outputs as far as I can see., Unresolved,0
