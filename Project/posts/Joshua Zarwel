Sunday August 18th 2013 10:44 pm -04:00,Hey! Install Python 3.xThe two are pretty darn different. Things that work in 2.x will not in 3.x. An example: print Hello works in 2.x but not in 3.x which you would need to type print (Hello)Good luck!,None,7

Sunday September 1st 2013 5:00 pm -04:00,Hey!Yes this is a known issue. The autograder is working but it is way behind. Please be patient and dont submit more until the autograder catches up. I was having the same issue.It would actually be nice if Autograder had an option to cancel submissions as I have five duplicate submissions waiting in the queue. Being able to cancel some of them might help Autograder catch up.For more info see here: https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1096, Resolved,7

Monday September 2nd 2013 3:08 pm -04:00,Ok on this problem we are asked: The minimum passing grade is 50. Variable grade refers to the grade for a student. Select the expression(s) that correspond with the English sentence:The student passed.50 >= grade is marked as failing by the Grader but if I were to assign grade = 50 which is a passing grade the bool would return pass.My question is: as the bool asks greater than OR equal too would this not be correct in the case of grade = 50? For it to be truly fail should the expression not be: 49 >= grade if in this situation we are dealing only with int?ThanksJosh, Unresolved,3
Monday September 2nd 2013 4:03 pm -04:00,but it is not true that when the grade is less than or equal to 50 the student passedBut actually it is. Like in sentential logic the or operator only requires one side to be true not both like AND would require.IOW 50 is not greater than 50 nor less than 50 but 50 IS equal to 50.Remember that in this quiz we dont know the value of grade we are just asked to select the expressions that read as if the student passed. Reading 50 >= grade knowing that anything below 50 is failing but being equal to 50 is passing the student would pass this test with a 50. This DOES fulfill the requirements of the expression.If the expression simply said 50 > grade then yes it would read as failed., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 7:34 pm -04:00,We are kind of splitting hairs here but my point in the OP was that the student COULD have passed. The expression does not conclude that the student passed or failed. The student COULD have passed or COULD have failed.But the English sentence we are trying to derive is the student passed which I assume is equal to the student defiantly passed. So with that I guess the expression does not fullfill the requirements.Interesting to think about though., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 7:44 pm -04:00,Hey Dave Notepad++ is great but in this case use the editor in IDLE!Open IDLE and go to File and select New Window.This editor will tab/indent everything for you! Makes things a lot easier.Good luck!, Unresolved,1

Saturday September 14th 2013 8:49 pm -04:00,+= is a short way to say x = x + yFor example:if x = 5then x = x + 2 makes x = 7or you could just type x += 2 which also makes x = 7, Unresolved,0

Monday September 16th 2013 8:12 pm -04:00,They are not saying that range(110): == what they give as a result.The are saying range(10) == range(1) range(2) range(3) etc.But the typo makes it confusing.Cheers!, Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 10:38 pm -04:00,Hi AlainThat is not what they are giving an example of here. The fact is printing the numbers (results) in range (10) produces the results:0123456789Same as if we went number by number range(1) range(2) etc. Would be the same result.Cheers!, Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 11:50 pm -04:00,@Alain:for x in range (110):is different from:for x in range (10):But as I said the wording could have been better. , Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 10:48 pm -04:00,The lecture notes state: The example below will print all the numbers in the RANGE of 1 to 10.for i in range(10):        print (i)0123456789All of the numbers in the RANGE of 1 to 10 are:0123456789They say the example will print all the numbers in the RANGE of 1 to 10.And no range(110) is not the same as range(10) nor range(1) range(2) etc.But yes the wording could have been better.Cheers!, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 12:51 am -04:00,Hey TomMy point is this example is using range(10) not range (110). if in IDLE you type:for x in range (1):     print(x)you do indeed get a 0 and so on just as the example shows. Thus range of 1 is a 0. range of 2 is a 1. range of 3 is a 2 and so on.But we all have a point. The wording is what makes it difficult( and makes us all correct in one way or another). Fun to think about!Cheers!, Resolved,0

Tuesday September 24th 2013 8:03 pm -04:00,You can also use single forward slashes for your path.For example: file = open ( /users/josh/desktop/test.txt r)orfile_Location = /users/josh/desktop/test.txtfile = open (file_Location r)Just seems cleaner to me., Resolved,2
Wednesday September 25th 2013 9:52 am -04:00,Using forward slashes you can go ahead and add a drive to your file path. For example:file = open ( c:/users/josh/desktop/test.txt r)orfile_Location = c:/users/josh/desktop/test.txtfile = open (file_Location r), Resolved,1
