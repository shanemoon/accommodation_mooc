Sunday September 22nd 2013 9:24 pm -04:00,Apologies if this repeats other queries but I did trawl through.I understand you have three hours to complete the exam which I suppose means that we should choose to start it at a time when interruptions are expected to be minimal. I presume we dont have the ability to stop the clock during the exam?Is the exam multi choice or does it adopt a format similar to the exercises and assignments?Is it expected to actually take three hours to complete? I am a little concerned that I will be pretty slow so just wonder if time is likely to be a problem.Will it be open book? I do not feel ready to write very much code without checking other examples.On a side note this feels pretty good for an introduction. I did a paper at University using Fortran/67 some years ago so although not a novice I am pretty damn rusty. It has been very good so far and I really appreciate getting the opportunity to do this. Thanks., Resolved,4
Monday September 23rd 2013 5:36 pm -04:00,Is it that because nothing is being returned the type must be by definition nonetype? Unless it is because the list could be string or numeric or integer?I am not certain I get it either., Unresolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 5:45 pm -04:00,First question: In the lecture notes it says:Â Thestop value is not included.I wonder what this means the stop value is the only required parameter in range which has me even more confused. Or is it merely saying that the value of stop (say 5) is not included in the loop because it will go from 0 to 4 (4 being position 5)?Second question: how come there is no check for len(<1) in the program but is specifically stated as a precondition butthere is no check for it and yet no error when you run it?, Unresolved,1
Thursday September 26th 2013 6:26 am -04:00,I have managed to get make_str_from_row working although it does not feel like it is working as I would expect.Converting that process to make_str_from_column should in theory be easy but I cant figure how to translate what I did which feels like a klugy workaround into the other dimension.I was getting repeated TypeError: list indices must be integers not str responses in the line where I build the row until I went for the workaround.Now I am hitting the same issue as I try to build the words from the column. I just cant figure out a better way I think it is to do with addressing the two dimensional list from inside a for loop.I am reluctant to post code here dont want to upset things.As I re-read above this feels horrifically vague and slightly unanswerable.Any suggestions on a good way forward?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 1:00 am -04:00,I checked the assignment feedback and I seem to be failing quite a few things including:student: test_a3.Test_02_ReadBoard.test_01_return_typestudent: test_a3.Test_02_ReadBoard.test_03_rectangular_assymetric_boardstudent: test_a3.Test_02_ReadBoard.test_03_square_assymetric_boardstudent: test_a3.Test_09_WordScore.test_03_short_wordI can guess what some mean but I am guessing I have missed something in the instructions somewhere. I have tried expanding some of the wordlists and tests to check that things work and it all checks out.Any clues on the sort of things I need to do?, Unresolved,0
