Monday August 19th 2013 8:01 pm -04:00,These 2.xx vs. 3.xx discussions are really getting boring imho.If 2.xx was used > people would say Why not 3.xx blablablaIf 3.xx was used > people would say Why not 2.xx blablabla3.xx was chosen for this course (mind you a beginners course) for various reasons and the teachers have explained these.Just live with it. If you want you can:1: Take this course and switch to 2.xx after it2: Stick to 3.xx3: Use both.4: Not taking this course at all.See youve got all the freedom you want.Also the course is called Learn to Program: The fundamentals not Learn Python. They could have taken any other language but this one seemed to fit best for THIS course to them., Resolved,2

Dont forget people following this course are from all over the world and in a lot of countries access to the internet is not as stable as we are used to., Resolved,4

Wednesday September 4th 2013 6:25 pm -04:00,Thank you for the clarification!English is not my native language and that sentence really had me baffled. I thought the passing grade if exactly one grade is a passing grade was something Canadian and not standard English :D, Unresolved,3
Thursday September 12th 2013 7:58 am -04:00,Then please tell me whats the use of a problem domain?If a molecular biologist tells me to program this for him and he/she tells me (or the documentation on DNA) that no dn sequence is not a dna sequence who am I to argue?This is exactly the reason why (custom written) software in many cases does not do what customers expect or are used to. Programmers blindly following the specs not caring about the users/customers., Resolved,3

Thursday September 12th 2013 7:09 am -04:00,But not a DNA sequence else BBATRR should also be valid because its also a valid string.Then they should have mentioned we just had to look for a valid string and not a valid DNA sequence., Resolved,1

Saturday October 5th 2013 7:49 am -04:00,Nothing will happen. If you dont have 70% the world will keep on turning life goes on and you will not disappear from the face of the earth. If you do have more than 70% the world will keep on turning bla bla bla but you now get a nice statement of accomplishment to feel good about for a couple of days(maybe just hours) but it will be useless for anything else.The real win is... by now you should have some idea of what programming is and how to program., Resolved,1
