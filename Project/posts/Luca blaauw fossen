Saturday September 14th 2013 1:16 pm -04:00,Hi I realised I had two get_complement(char)s but I forgot to remove the first one.Also return new_sequence was NOT indented but I did indent it here as I forgot the indentations after some bug cleared all the indentations. And yes I am submitting the right file. So honestly I do not know what is going on at all., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 1:29 pm -04:00,I think it is ineffective and weird that we have to wait 1 hour in-between submitting code. Sometimes we make a small mistake and we have to wait 1 hour before correcting it. Can someone explain why?Thanks., Unresolved,0
