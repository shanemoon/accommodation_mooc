Saturday October 5th 2013 5:10 am -04:00,I still cant figure out this one. I defined range as len(board[0]) but this way the function identifies words only within the string made of 1st characters of the lists. Words in all other columns are not found (returned False).(I also tried changing the index or writing additional for-loop functions for each item (index) of the list but that resulted in an error.), Resolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 4:51 am -04:00,I also have a problem at the starting point. Based on the example of video lectures I defined the file with its location opened it and printed it using for line in file. It works great in IDLE and it prints out the 4 example words.Therefore I just wrote that as the body of the read_words function > but its not correct.What are we supposed to do within the assignment file? Id appreciate any tip., Unresolved,0
