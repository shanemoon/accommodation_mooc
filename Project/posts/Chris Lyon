Thursday October 3rd 2013 12:26 pm -04:00,Hi guys this is my first post but I am really struggling to get going on the A3. Ive been at it for hours and am about to go crazy :)I just need a nudge in the right direction if it;s allowed.For the first code (is valid word) I ran the following code and submitted my answer and got 0.found = False    for item in wordlist:        if word in item:            found = True    return foundNow I ran some examples and they all work.  Can anyone point me in the right direction please? Is the code wrong or am I looking at it the worng way.  Do I have to open the file and read lines from that?Any help would be much appreciated.Chris, Resolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 2:13 pm -04:00,Yup you were correct at first I had over complicated things as Ive done through the whole course (it is a good learning tool though).  At first I had re-watched Paul Vries video about Building a program and had though I needed to open the file etc etc first.  Then I read that we didnt need to do that in a3.py at all.  I adjusted but forgot to delete the code above the def function (file_name = /User/Example/etc/file.txt etc etc) that I had entered.  I have now deleted and re-submitted and all is good.  Now that its sorted I should breeze through the rest.... lol.  Thanks for the help.Kind Regards Chris., Resolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 9:55 am -04:00,I have been working on this bit for approx 12 hours and am about to go insane again!!After a million different tries my examples finally work.  I am however sceptical.  I dont want to submit cause I wouldnt be sure if its 100% or not.  The code I ended up with was :    list =     full =         for row_index in range(len(board)):        list.append(make_str_from_row(board row_index))        for item in range(len(list)):            for i in range(len(list)):                full = full + list[i]                return word in fullIt seems overly complicated but it seems to work with the examples.  Is it ok?, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 10:20 am -04:00,Yup just realised that they gave us the code for that problem. What an idiot I am but at least it gave me hours and hours of practice. Question is do I use the code they gave or the one I just did.  Because its not marked (as they gave it to us) how will I know if its really correct?I think I am going to use their code.  Unless they say its ok., Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 3:38 pm -04:00,For the life of me I cant see whats wrong with my code for word_score?.  Can anyone see the error.  Ive been at this assignment for days and 12 hours today so its probably my brain just been tired.All the code does is gives is the len(word) * 1 for any length of word.As in word_score(DRUDGERY) gives back 8    score = 0    if len(word) < 3:        score = 0    elif len(word) >= 3 or len(word) <= 6:        score = len(word) * 1    elif len(word) >= 7 or len(word) <= 9:        score = len(word) * 2    elif len(word) >= 10:        score = len(word) * 3            return scoreIf tried running all manner of things but cant seem to get it to work.  A shove in the right direction would be much appreciated.Chris, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 3:49 pm -04:00,Yup sorted I think 12 hours of studying with only a 30 min break for lunch is confusing my brain.  Its 9pm in Scotland so gonna leave it now and relax and finish the rest tomorrow.That worked perfectly so many thanks., Unresolved,0
