Saturday August 31st 2013 5:11 am -04:00,but hours_asleep is given value 5 at line 11if the current stage of execution is line 9 why the answer is 300?, Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 5:53 am -04:00,Thanks I imagined you were not explaining the answer.The parameter assignment is clear however the answer marked correct by the Quiz is 300. Adolfo also posted about it above. Isnt this an appropriate thread to discuss it? , Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 8:30 am -04:00,here we dont see the right side (Frame + Objects): probably this Quiz assumes that the current stage is at line 9 because the function minutes_asleep in line 12 was already run and so this function is now currently been executed (after hours_asleep was set = 5 at line 11), Resolved,0

Thursday September 26th 2013 9:18 pm -04:00,I have a similar code (no open) since the forums say its not needed in the code but when I enter merged after the function has been called (and returned the right result) it says NameError: name merged is not definedwhich to me doesnt make any sense, Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 9:59 pm -04:00,not sure theres actually anything to be fixed here: I got full credit for submitting the read_words codeits just the accumulator which keeps being not defined I only wanted to know why, Unresolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 6:21 am -04:00,Thank you Tome yes I call the function that way.Ok so the value of a local function is not available after the function is executed thanks for making that clear., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 9:01 pm -04:00,I used the same method but I dont understand whats wrong: when testing the code it displays the list correctly but when I check words it says NameError: name words is not defined.I defined it before the for loop why does it says it is not defined?And the code ends with return words: how can it return the list correctly if words is not defined? , Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 7:43 am -04:00,My result is exactly the one posted by Lee.I have no idea how could I possibly further modify my code. One error says:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Note that the last line of the input file for a board does not have a newline character.(and by the way: this is false because if you display all lines even the last one has )But even if I set up a range(len(line) - 1) the last line is still displayed entirely ([J E P Q L Y N X D L]) so whats the problem?Using rstrip will leave  at the end of the lines resulting in failureUsing range(len(line) - 1) in the lines results in the Failure reported aboveUsing range(len(board_file) - 1) to differentiate the last line - which has no newline - results in an error because board_file has no len()Using range(0 10) results in the failure ERROR: IndexError string index out of rangeI spent hours on this and dont know what else I can do, Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 8:38 am -04:00,Thank you Oliverusing that it gives back NameError: global name line is not definedBasically using while I dont know how to define line: I tried to define line in the while statement and outside of it under a for statement but it never works, Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 9:00 am -04:00,I use variable line but using while Im stuck even a step above: I dont know how to define line in the first placea part from that if I print the whole file the last line is empty so I would have no idea what to use other than Wendy Im just in the same situation as yours. I am honestly giving up at this point because Im spending hours on this: I spent more on the last 3 points of the assignment than in all the rest of the assignment; its just getting ridiculous, Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 10:53 am -04:00,using the while method in that lecture it ends up same as above: perfect display andFAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Note that the last line of the input file for a board does not have a newline character.(and again of course the while loop is programmed to stop when reaching the final empty line but it does not seem to make any difference), Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 12:00 pm -04:00,Absolutely because if I dont define line first executing the code in the shell will give backUnboundLocalError: local variable line referenced before assignmentie: if line would not be defined before using the while loop I wouldnt even see this result:[[E F J A J C O W S S] [S D G K S R F D F F] [A S R J D U S K L K] [H E A N D N D J W A] [A N S D N C N E O P] [P M S N F H H E J E] [J E P Q L Y N X D L]], Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 12:44 pm -04:00,The nested for loop approach was the first I tried and also with that one the results were displayed perfectly (same as above).But no credit was given and instead I got feedback:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Note that the last line of the input file for a board does not have a newline character.So I went to the while approach to ignore the last line when removing the newline character.Between these I tried every possible combination I could imagine: rstrip; range based on length; range with fixed indexes; I even tried to split the function in 2 different functions in order to call the first from the second but could not figure out the logic to use.I still dont understand how they want the last line to be treated. while line != : should prevent the execution to reach the final empty line... but no: it keeps giving no credit and these feedback making no sense to me.I cannot care less about the grade (and these are really just 3 points on a total of 37): I only want to understand what does the assignment wants and whats wrong with the code., Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 1:43 pm -04:00,I ended up with massive trial and error as well and yes some feedback are funny :-)For the rstrip in the current approach I already use a range based on range(len(line)-1) which already removes the  at the end but I did as you suggested adding rstrip() to the .append just to tryEverything as usual: looks all good in the shell no credit same feedbackAnd as before using just rstrip() in the .append without range leaves  at the end of each list. No creditI now spent more time on read_board than on all the other assignments altogether; and thats it: read_board made me hate programming., Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 2:06 pm -04:00,Lecture 5.1: if the loop condition is true then the body of the while loop is executed again and this process repeats until the loop condition becomes false in factwhile not (s[i] in aeiouAEIOU):    print (s[i])    i = i + 1hIn my code while line !=  is above the .append statements (ie: the .append are under while line != ) so the moment it encounters  the condition is false the loop must stop and go to the next line (with the same indent which is return). So it should not return another , Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 2:29 pm -04:00,Patrick you got it! It was this to be missing.The rstrip() should have been applied to the line when calling the for loop (not when appending the single characters to the lines list). You really got the point.However I still dont get why removing the  from the single characters is wrong: in fact the display in the shell is identical. If the character is   removing it does not append anything to the list (ie: it does not append ).In any case than you very much.Thanks a lot also to Lee Morlaye Wendy and Oliver for helping on this absurd puzzle!, Resolved,0
