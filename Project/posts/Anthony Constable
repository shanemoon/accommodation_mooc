Saturday September 28th 2013 9:17 am -04:00,I have used two for loops to complete make_str_from_column. I have tested this numerous ways and cant see a fault. But when I enter the code for submission I only get one mark out of three.. I dont know why.I have tried with positive and negative indexes. The errors I have are on...student: test_a3.Test_06_MakeStrFromColumn.test_02_middle_columnFAILUREstudent: test_a3.Test_06_MakeStrFromColumn.test_03_end_columnsFAILURE, Resolved,0

Sunday September 29th 2013 3:51 am -04:00,Done. I re-jigged the code to inc only one line of code by putting column_index inside the loop. Still not sure why the previous version failed but hay-ho! On to the next bit of my bad coding I go!, Resolved,0
