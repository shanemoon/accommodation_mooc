Monday September 2nd 2013 8:40 am -04:00,Hi Keilah - I would do as Rodney suggests and start with two masses to see if you can get that to work. If however I was interested in modelling the solar system I would probably start with realistic masses. The sun is essentially stationary because its mass is about 300000 times the mass of the earth. It would probably be easier to see if its working. Of course the dynamics is more interesting if the masses are similar but its up to you.The other suggestion is to use realistic units. Its been a very looooong time but I used to do molecular dynamics using FORTRAN and an abacus. Your life will be way easier and your code will be much less susceptible to roundoff error if you choose units on the scale of the problem. You dont measure a foot race in microns and centuries but thats essentially what youre doing. I personally would choose the unit of mass to be the earth mass. Then the sun mass is 330000 earth masses. Choose the natural unit of distance to be the earth-sun distance. Then choose your time unit to be something realistic like one year since thats the period of the orbit. Given those conversions I find the gravitational constant G to be 0.000118.There are many choices. For example you could choose the unit of time to be a day instead of a year (that changes G) you could choose the sun mass to be your unit of mass or you could choose G=1. That determines your time scale for a given mass and length scale. The whole point is to try to make the problem as close as possible to order 1 to eliminate all of that unnecessary code and all of those unnecessary floating operations. It will run much faster with much greater accuracy. With respect to my comment about your time increment I think you chose a month 1/12 of an orbit as your increment. Imagine that to a very crude first approximation you are trying to approximate a circle by a series of line segments. You wont get anything resembling a circle with 12 line segments. You would have to play with it to find out where your model goes bad but I would run it with a time increment of maybe 1/100 of an orbit and then 1/1000 of an orbit etc tracking the difference as you go. When finer time increments dont improve accuracy youve likely found a reasonable increment. Its as much art as science because the machine is rather dumb.,None,1

I passed the class because I got 100% on all of the quizzes and the final but had a horrible time with the programming assignments. I finished 2 of the 6. I decided to teach myself Python to do those assignments and had fairly good luck. With work I was able to write most of the programs and they worked when I passed small data sets for test cases. My issue was that the data sets for the assignments came in the form of huge sets of data (100000 or more) in text files using notepad or some such thing. The data had to be read from the text file into arrays to be used by the program. I never did figure out a way to read the data for my programs to use and everyone on the discussion boards used different languages and had different methods for reading data. So I ended up with working code but I couldnt complete the assignments because I couldnt read the given data.So is there some standard method or best method for reading a generic file from within a Python program? Does it depend on the file type that the data is stored in? Does it depend on what the final array should look like? Sometimes it was an nx1 sometimes an nx2 sometimes even n rows with variable number of columns. Any help would be appreciated.,None,0

Monday September 9th 2013 11:44 am -04:00,I think that you are doing this poor kid (I assume its a young person) a horrible disservice by telling him that he can learn mathematics by programming. That was his question. You can no more do that than you can learn to be a carpenter by running a saw mill or learn a foreign language by buying a dictionary.Mathematics is the study of sets of abstract objects and their relationships. Mathematics is set theory logic metric spaces real analysis complex analysis functional analysis integration theory topology linear algebra (not matrix math) abstract algebra number theory ODEs PDEs etc. Computers have very little application to theory and one certainly can not learn mathematical theory by learning to program. Even the suggestion that he could learn applied mathematics by learning to program in incorrect. Applied mathematics what I do is asymptotic analysis perturbation theory global analysis boundary layer theory integral equations inverse problems etc. In fact applied mathematics depends heavily on all of the above fields of pure mathematics plus knowledge of the field to which it is being applied whether engineering physics chemistry biology finance financial engineering economics etc. The average young person has a misconception that mathematics is about solving an equation such as theyve seen most of their lives. It is not. In fact most mathematicians rarely work with numbers or equations. Is mathematics useful for a programmer? Certainly but the math depends on what you need to program. A fundamental understanding of discrete math and logic will make you a better programmer. Beyond that the math you need to know depends on what you need to do. If you need to model complex non-linear dynamical systems or do Monte Carlo simulations of gases or quantum systems then you better understand the physics and mathematics of what youre doing. Otherwise you wont get past the first line of your program. Youre not going to learn that material by writing a program if you have no idea what the program is even supposed to do.So what can technology do for a mathematician physicist engineer chemist or biologist? It can be incredibly useful in solving lengthy numerical problems that we previously had zero hope of solving by hand. It allows us to simulate very complex systems that we otherwise would never have been able to model by hand. We can analyze huge data sets and from them develop theories or test existing theories. While its a fantastic tool it does not provide the theory as to why a system behaves the way it does or how we can extrapolate to another system. In fact without the theory you really have no idea of how to even write a program or whether your program is doing anything realistic. About 15-20 years ago in the US there was a massive push to integrate technology into university classrooms. Every kid in algebra or trigonometry had a graphing calculator. Entire books were written on how to do math with your calculator. What we found was that nobody learned math they learned how to push keys to get a numerical answer. When they got to calculus they didnt have the prerequisite knowledge. So the powers that be decided that we should do calculus with calculators. Then when the students got to the first real math class they all failed because they didnt know calculus. There was spillover to their science and engineering classes because the math department wasnt doing their job. Now we have backed away from that. We allow calculators in the classroom as a learning aid but still require that the students learn math. We teach them math and allow the calculator as a tool for visualizing what theyve learned and doing tedious calculations not as a substitute for learning mathematics. We essentially lost a generation of kids with an experiment gone awry. No Vijay you can not learn mathematics or physics or chemistry or biology or engineering or economics by learning to program. If you want to study those things you need to study those things and then you might find your programming skills to be a useful tool. However if you become a pure mathematician or a theoretical physicist you will probably find that the primary use for your computer is sending e-mail or surfing the web because it wont be useful in your work. If you would like a taste of what mathematics is here is a free download of a very good book:http://www.trillia.com/zakon1.htmlThis is the kind of book that we use in what we call a bridge class. It is generally for students who have finished calculus and need an introduction to real mathematics before taking higher level topic specific courses. They learn fundamental concepts of set theory logic relationships and equivalence as well as getting an introduction to what a proof is. There are a couple of other free books on the site but you should start with this one. Whether your interest is in pure or applied mathematics these concepts and skills are fundamental.,None,2
Monday September 9th 2013 3:00 pm -04:00,Alain thats not learning mathematics. The links you reference are tools for visualizing and better understanding statistical concepts not a replacement for learning statistics. The mathematical theory is presented alongside the computer models. His question was not whether programming could help him in learning math or whether math was useful to programmers or programming was useful in math or science. His question was:But I am wondering if we could actually do and practice higher(University) level Math using programming alone?The answer is no programming is not mathematics and programming does does substitute for mathematics nor alleviate the need to learn mathematics to do mathematics. It does not replace the need to understand physics either. Sure some theoretical physicists use modelling in their work (as I suggested above) but they also understand physics and they did not learn that by programming a computer they learned it by studying physics.

Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:26 am -04:00,Heres the best explanation Ive seen:Objects that have been created (and everything is an object in Python) occupy the memory allocated to the Python interpreter process. When you import a module its code is executed resulting in the creation of many objects (functions classes data etc.) most of which must persist in memory to be useful. By separating functionality into logically distinct modules we allow programs to devote their memory only to objects providing the functionality they need.If everything were built-in you would have a huge chunk of memory devoted to all the classes functions and other objects of the entire standard library less than 1% of which would actually be useful to the average program. Furthermore you would waste time executing all the code that creates all these objects every time the interpreter starts.So you can run much faster and use less memory by not wasting your time with a lot of things that you never use but they are available for those who do need them., Resolved,3
Sunday September 15th 2013 9:44 am -04:00,I think youre misunderstanding the problem.

Friday September 13th 2013 10:14 pm -04:00,It appears that your problem is not coding youre not understanding what a complementary sequence is Ramon. Individual nucleotides A and T are complements C and G are complements. Thats the job of get_complement. If you pass it A it returns T if you pass G it returns C pass T it returns A pass C it returns G. get_complementary_sequence accepts a valid string of arbitrary length and returns the complementary sequence. The complementary sequence is the string of the same length with each nucleotide replaced by its complement. So the complement of AAA is TTT the complement of ATTCGA is TAAGCT etc. , Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 9:52 am -04:00,I used it but the phrase have to is I think misleading. You can do it any way that you see fit but the beauty of programming is that you can call other code that youve already written. To find the complement of a sequence you have to find the complement of each nucleotide in the sequence. You already wrote code to do that so you may as well just call it instead of rewriting it in the body of get_complementary_sequence. Not a big deal here but if get_complement was hundreds of lines of code you would save an enormous amount of time by reusing it. It might also prevent errors by using something that you already know works. If get_complement works but get_complementary_sequence does not then you know the problem is most likely the call., Resolved,0

Monday September 16th 2013 8:20 pm -04:00,Its not an error. All numbers in the range from 1 to 10 does not mean all integers from 1 to 10. , Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 9:56 pm -04:00,What quiz time? I think the OP is suggesting that it should print the integers from 1 to 10. Could have been worded better maybe as all integers from the range of 1 to the range of 10 but I dont think that was his problem., Resolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 8:46 pm -04:00,Just curious if anyone knows what actually happens in this case. Is it a memory overflow?, Resolved,0

Thursday September 19th 2013 11:17 am -04:00,Actually 2 questions but the first is for staff. Looking ahead it appears that next week we will learn how to read external data into a python program. Am I reading that correctly?Second question is: are there particular file types that are necessary for that external data? Specifically Im wondering if I can read a column from a spreadsheet Excel in this case into a Python list or will I have to copy that data into a particular format in a particular file type before Python can use it? Thanks.,None,0

Thursday September 19th 2013 11:58 am -04:00,I should have seen that one coming. Thanks for the link! Since I get revised data daily in the same format and I want to perform repetitive tasks that might be useful for me.,None,0

Friday September 20th 2013 2:53 pm -04:00,Those results look correct. Most of the errors look like youre returning the empty string instead of the expected result. If you have no print statements did you go through and make sure everything is named correctly and you are returning the thing that you want to return?, Resolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 3:24 pm -04:00,I asked that because your solutions to the test cases asked above are correct. That suggests that your algorithm is correct but you are just returning the wrong thing. Since his code is wrong would it be a violation to post it? We could just point out the line where the problem is. Why not post just one of them maybe get_complementary_sequence and see if we get yelled at. I dont think posting code that doesnt work is posting solutions., Resolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 4:36 pm -04:00,Bingo! Check this out:>>> a = [1 2]>>> b = a>>> a is bTrue>>> c = [1 2]>>> a is cFalseI cant find a good explanation but apparently is literally checks to see if 2 objects are the same object not if they are equivalent. Maybe we have a Python guru who can verify this., Resolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 4:45 pm -04:00,I think it has to do with how things are stored. Your shell might do it differently than the machine doing the grading? It looks like if a=1 and b=a then is b because a and b reference the same memory address. But if a=1 and b=1 then a is b may be true or not depending on how the machine stores memory addresses or references. , Resolved,0

Friday September 20th 2013 3:30 pm -04:00,s[0:3] includes everything with index from 0 to 2 or in other words everything with index less than 3., Unresolved,1
Friday September 20th 2013 3:49 pm -04:00,Well it is at least self-consistent. I found this useful. If you understand what a string is and how python iterates through a string it helps a lot:http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/ch07.html, Unresolved,1
Friday September 20th 2013 4:40 pm -04:00,Youre welcome. One thing that Ive learned is that a lot of very smart people think in entirely different ways. If its a different way of thinking it will be more work for you but youll likely get very good at it if you use it enough., Unresolved,1
Friday September 20th 2013 7:45 pm -04:00,abc returns the out of range because on the third iteration of the loop (i=2) you increment i by 1 and try to iterate on the 4th element but there isnt one. With 123abc you exit the loop when you hit a digit. That makes isdigit true and not isdigit false so you dont continue., Unresolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 7:48 pm -04:00,Try mystery(abc1) and youll see whats happening. , Unresolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 9:09 pm -04:00,Be careful mystery(abc1) should return abc. You add all non digit characters until you hit a digit and then return the string generated.This is my understanding of a while loop. The while line contains a conditional. Python first evaluates the conditional. If it is True then python continues and executes the body of the loop. It then returns to the first line and re-evaluates the conditional. As long as that conditional is true it will continue to execute the body of the loop repetitively. The very first time that the conditional is False python skips the loop never to return to the loop and executes the next line in the code following the body of the loop. In this case the while statement contains the conditional while not s[i].isdigit():If the current character is a letter then is.digit is False not is.digit is true and the body is executed. As soon as you encounter a digit then is.digit is True not is.digit is False and you exit the loop and return result., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 2:57 pm -04:00,Hi HimMaybe you could clarify what you would like that code to do. You have type errors. If you want to iterate over test then test must be a string. But then no % 2 is not defined. Im also not sure how your if and elif statements are related to each other., Unresolved,0

Friday September 20th 2013 11:51 pm -04:00,I answered the question without running the code so I just ran it and it works fine. Do you retype it or just copy and paste into the module?, Resolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 12:37 am -04:00,That was going to be my suggestion. Its probably something like indentation or taking the hash mark off of the comment line., Resolved,0
