Saturday August 31st 2013 4:43 am -04:00,There are tons of video for python 3+ on youtube.But you dont specify what you are actually looking for.Are you complete new to python and you want to learn python 3.3?Then i suppose this course is adequate.You will learn most of the stuff you need with the lectures.If you are anxious and you want to learn them faster than the course scheduleyoutube has many tutorials.If you are familiar with prior python versions like python2.7 and wanna see the the differences with python2.7 and python 3+also youtube has many tutorials with the differences of python 3.3 with python 2.7.In the web there are infinite sources of videos and tutorials and courses about pythonif you can be more specific about what you are lookingyou will get better answers i suppose.But i think if you are totally beginner you dont needat least for nowanything more than the lectures of this course and this forum.,None,0

Friday August 30th 2013 6:16 pm -04:00,As Henry saidyou still have 2 days for Exercise 1and 9 days for Exercise 2 and Assignment 1so you can still ace this course and get 100% grade.Even if you cannot manage to do the first exercise in timeit counts only 5% to the final gradeso you can still get 95%(you only need 70% to pass the course and get certified).So definitely you are not too late.If you have 2-4 hours to study until Sunday and try the exercise 1you will sure manage to complete it.(you have 5 tries),None,2

Saturday August 31st 2013 8:25 am -04:00,No as far as i know if you close them properlythere would be no problem even if you had 100 ... in a row.Whatever seen as green on the idleit is in the docstring or string and dont execute.If it has no colour or different colours you probably forget to close the docstring or you used one quote more., Resolved,1
Saturday August 31st 2013 8:34 am -04:00,If i am not mistaken about what you are askingwhat the fucntions ask is how many full hours are in 90.000 seconds.For 90.000 seconds thats 25 full hours so that your functions should return if it takes as argument 90.000 seconds.I dont know how much i can help without breaking the codebut it is pretty simple if you understand what the function is asking.EDIT My badsorry i didnt remember that was to 24 hour clock.It must be a bug in the grader or the grader didnt check for more than 24 hours cause i think my  code passed without the converting hours to 24 hour clock., Resolved,2
Saturday August 31st 2013 8:50 am -04:00,Yes i just saw thati edited my commentsorry for the problem.But as i said i think the code dont check outside that rangecause mine passed with full marks without converting to 24 hour clock., Resolved,1

Saturday August 31st 2013 8:15 am -04:00,As the other saidyou were using python 2.7 probably.In python 2.7 input()evaluates what you are parsing.So when you typed Dan python could nt  understand itcause it was none of the accepted types(strintfloatnonebool..).Ifyou had typed Danwith quotesit would have been a string and it would have been ok.If you  type True it would be the boolean Trueif you type 4it would be the integer 4.So in python 2.7 you use raw_input() insteadthat takes whatever you type and assign it as a string.So Dan would be Dan with raw_input() in python 2.7Examples                                                  ~~Python 2.7~~>>> input(age :)  age :18                                      #input() with an integer18                                           #assign to integer>>> input(age :)                           age :twenty                                  #input() with plain textTraceback (most recent call last):           #NameError  File <pyshell#5> line 1 in     input(age :)  File  line 1 in NameError: name twenty is not defined>>> input(age :)age :twenty                                #input() with stringtwenty                                     #assigns to string>>> raw_input(age : )age : 20                                     #raw_input() with integer20                                         #assigns to string>>> raw_input(age : )age : twenty                                 #raw_input() with plain texttwenty                                     #assigns to string>>> raw_input(age : )age : twenty                               #raw_input() with string twenty                                   #assigns the string into new string Now in this course we re using Python 3.3.In python 3.3 input()  DO NOT EVALUATE what you are parsingsimilar to the raw_input() of python 2.7.So everythingyou type would be a string even without the quotes.If you want to evaluate what you are parsing you should use another builtin function of python eval() or you can use the other builtin functions that convert to that typelike int() float()bool() of what you want.So if you want to assign an integeryou can use eval(input(....)) and type the integer or int(input(...)) and type the integer and it will be assigned as integer and not as stringExamples                                                 ~~Python 3.3~~>>> input(age : )age : 20                                          #input() with integer20                                              #assigns to string>>> input(age : )age : twenty                                      #input() with plain texttwenty                                          #assigns to string>>> input(age : )age : twenty                                    #input() with stringtwenty                                        #assigns string into new string>>> eval(input(age : ))age : 20                                          #eval(input()) with integer20                                                #assigns to integer>>> eval(input(age : ))age : twenty                                      #eval(input()) with plain textTraceback (most recent call last):                #gives you NameError  File  line 1 in     eval(input(age : ))  File  line 1 in NameError: name twenty is not defined>>> eval(input(age : ))                         #eval(input()) with stringage : twenty                                    #assigns to stringtwenty, Resolved,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 6:53 am -04:00,I think whats happened is that form today an additional test added for one function(get_hours()) on the grader cause it dont check for a specific rangeand so from today you have to pass 42 tests instead of 41.So if you pass them you get a 42/42 as shown on the detailsbut in the assignments pageit shows 42/41(probably forgot to change that too). , Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 4:27 pm -04:00,In assignment instructionsyou can see that the range of the output for get_hours must be (0..23) inclusiveso if you output 105 for test large input you are forgetting to do something., Resolved,1

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 1:41 am -04:00,In which function you get the errorand which function code is this?I think you get the errorfor the get_hours() function and this is code from the seconds_difference or hour_difference cause time_1 time_2 are parameters from these functions.EditYes i saw your codeplease edit it out now.You are getting the error i think in another functionin get_hours() and not in those with the time_1 and time_2, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 1:50 am -04:00,No it checks get_hours functionuse any of those  methods you used before in get_hours() and you will be fine.get_hours() needs to be in range(023) inclusiveand you output 105so use the methods you know and used for hours_difference(without to be needed) and the error will disappear.When you are doneedit out your codeit is against Honor of Code posting code from assignments here mate., Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 7:16 am -04:00,An additional test case was added today on the grader.So all test passedis 42/42.If you submitted your codeyesterday and backyou got 41/41 if you had passed all the tests.Now i suppose there will be an announcement about this sometime.Best you can do is resubmit the codeto get 42/42 or check what you did wrong on the additional test case that may fail., Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:32 am -04:00,Check the details on the errors in the graderi assume there is some problem with indentation or some function that hasnt proper syntaxand you get a syntax error.If you get an error(not bad results)code stops executing.EditDid you checked your functions on idleby typing them each in the idle terminal or did you load the file in the idle and tested?If you did the firstload the file in the idleand run the module.You will see the errorsi am pretty sure that it is a syntax or indentation error.Python first tests all the functions for errors.Even if you got an error in any part of the filethe code will not run at all on the gradereven if all the others are working properly., Unresolved,0
