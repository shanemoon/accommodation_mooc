However you can submit any time before the hard deadline without late penalty.

Your effective score will be the highest score of all the allowed attempts made before the hard deadline.                                                                                                                                                      1 / 5                                                                                                                    Mon  2 Sep 2013  5:59 PM CEST (UTC +0200)                                                                       14.80 / 15.00, Resolved,0
