Monday August 19th 2013 9:34 am -04:00,The thing is Python 2 has been around for a lot longer and therefore there are a lot more packages available for Python 2 and also there is obviously a lot of legacy code around that is Python 2. Python 3 will inevitably rule eventually but it doesnt yet. For example AFAIK Twisted is only available in Python 2 at the moment but there is a project in hand to port it to Python 3. But if you know Python 3 then you will understand Python 2 (& vice versa). There are differences like the print statement & integer arithmetic but at its heart it is still the same language.As George Bernard Shaw said England and America are two countries separated by a common language. .

Monday August 19th 2013 2:01 pm -04:00,Computers are dumb they only do what you tell them. Think of a computer program as a sequence of instructions. The computer wont do anything you dont tell it to so when you initially assign x=2 & y =3 it does that when you then say z=x+y it takes the current value associated with x adds it to the current value associated with y & stores the result in a location called z and thats it there is no on-going association of x & y with z. When you then say x=6 & y=7 it asssociates x with the value 6 and y with the value 7 z is independant of x & y so if you want z to equal the sum of the new values of x & y you need to tell the computer to do that sum again.I see a couple of people have beat me to it while I was typing all that =;-), Resolved,12

Monday August 19th 2013 5:47 pm -04:00,Python is a very useful language in many areas. There are so many libraries for Python that extend its capabilities into so many areas. You can have desktop applications made with Python using one of the graphics libraries such as TkInter or Wxwidgets you can write web applications using something like Google App Engine. You can have a web server that will serve static web pages using one line of Python. You can write far more sophisticated servers that do all kinds of fun things using Twisted (another Python library for event driven programming). Python is a very versatile language. I have a Python program that interfaces to my bluetooth GPS receiver and another that interfaces to my twitter account & reads out the tweets on my incoming twitter feed.So you may ask why am I doing this course? In a few weeks time I have to face a classroom full of teenagers & attempt to teach them Python. Also I know a reasonable amount about Python 2 but Id like a new perspective on Python 3.,None,8

Thursday August 22nd 2013 4:24 pm -04:00,Sounds like you have 2 different versions of Python installed Python2 & Python3 do integer arithmetic differently so in Python2 9/2 = 4 in Python3 9/2 = 4.5This is one of the significant differences between Python2 & Python3. In Python2 it says OK all of the values are integers so Im going to give you an integer result. If you say 9.0/2 in Python2 you should get 4.5 because one of the values is a float it gives you the answer as a float.In Python3 they changed it so that 9/2 will give the answer 4.5 if you still want to do integer arithmetic then you need to use the // operator so if you do 9//2 in Python3 the answer will be 4.Hope this helps =;-),None,0

Depending on the Python implementation you are using you may be able to change the recursion limit if you really want to try looking up sys.getrucursionlimit() & sys.setrecursionlimit().Recursion can be a useful tool in certain situations such as recursive descent compilation but you really have to be sure your function will terminate eventually.Unrestricted recursion can hog your processor and in some cases the only way to get out of it is switching the power off so Python has safeguards to protect the unwary. ,None,0
