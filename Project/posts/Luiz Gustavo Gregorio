Monday August 19th 2013 7:50 pm -04:00,I have the same opinion as Tomalthough I know very little from programming on python I am fine to learn about python3 and then if necessary do some self study on python2 structure.In the near future python3 will be more used and when it gets to python4 or whatever we will be here discussing the same :D, Resolved,0

Wednesday August 21st 2013 10:17 am -04:00,Hannah are you using IDLE? I believe you are running this directly from Linux terminal right?If you are running directly from linux terminal you can do the following as I did and workedOpen gedit and set the module commands def area......  and save it on your home directory with the name triangle.pyTo load it on terminal start python3 and just type from triangle import *where triangle was the file name which you have saved for the module., Resolved,1
