Friday August 30th 2013 11:40 pm -04:00,Imagine youre anal about getting a perfect score on the exercise. You have 5 attempts to get it all right:1st attempt: 3 mistakes. You expected as much. Work through the problems and try again.2nd attempt: 2 mistakes. These two are little buggers. Work through them and try again. 3rd attempt: ARGH! Why do you keep getting these two wrong. This time re-read everything carefully. You think you have it figured out. Attempt again.4th attempt: You groan in displeasure. 17 out of 18 right. You think really hard about the last one giving you so many problems. You figure it out! It was just a simple error on your part. You have it all down now. Perfect score here I come!5th and last attempt: 17 out of 18 right. WHY!! Make a mistake on one of the questions you never got wrong before. , Unresolved,5
Monday September 16th 2013 10:57 pm -04:00,I copied Prof Campbells example of the while loop statement:while not [s[i] in aeiouAEIOU]:           print(s[i])           i = i + 1but didnt get the h like she did. However when I wrote instead:while s[i] not in aeiouAEIOU:           print(s[i])           i = i + 1only then did I get an h back. Am I missing something here? Should there be a difference between stating while not x in... and while x not in...?, Resolved,0
