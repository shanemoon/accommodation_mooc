Monday September 2nd 2013 10:07 am -04:00,To run python code you would use python3 <file name>.If the file is called somefile.py and has a bunch of defs in it you can also place a line near the top of another <someother.py> file using the import statement.  Just use somefile without the .py.import somefileThen you can use whatever functions are defined in that file., Unresolved,2

Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:44 am -04:00,Lets get some terminology out of the way first.The Mac Terminal is what is known as a shell or command line interpreter.  You can think of it as another general purpose environment to run programs just like the gui (Finder) but with a lot more flexibility.  It has its own programming language sort of called built ins and you can string together commands to pretty much write whatever you want.  Eventually.Idle is what I would consider a programming editor/debugger.  Ruby has one called irb.  You can set up editors such as Vi Textmate or Sublime Text to do the same thing.  They allow you to create files save and run those files as well as debug those files.  In the case of Idle or Irb they are language specific  Idle only runs python while irb only runs ruby.If you want to know more about the Terminal look up info on Linuxs bash online there is also online tutorials for the shell bash or cli.  There are also at least one book in the Linux section of your local bookstore on Command Line Interpreter or something like that.  For the MOST part the Linux Unix and Mac shells are equivalent.Some common shell commands.ls - list the contents of the current directory like dir on Winders.  Use ls -l for a long listing with sizes.man - help on a command  man lsapropos - search the manuals for help can get back a lot of suggestions apropos lscd - change directorymkdir - create a directoryrmdir - remove a directory has to be emptyrm - remove a filecat - concatenate a file cat somefile.txt displays a file.less - paginates a file less somefile.txt use the spacebar to continue q to quit.file - tells what the filetype is file <somefile>unzip - unzip a .zip filegzip - create an archivepwd - print the current working directory.WARNING -  You can get in a lot of trouble using these commands.  If you dont know what youre doing and you execute a specific type of rm command in your home directory you can delete everything and I mean everything.  Make sure you have a backup and you are running Time Machine regularly.  I am not in any way responsible for your new found power.Note.  The period and 3 letter extension really doesnt mean anything in the Mac.  You can have a text file called text.txt or text or text.exe or text I hate spaces.   Most people use it as an extension to help tell you what the file is but the computer doesnt care.  Also spaces in a file name are a pain to work in.  They are ok in the finder but not in the shell.  I always use underscores in place of spaces when I create a filename.  Even in the Finder.Sorry for the long post but this is only the beginning.  Ill try to answer questions but I dont have unlimited time...  :)Good luck.  , Unresolved,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 10:57 am -04:00,The IDLEs subprocess didnt make connection. Either etc. means it cant connect to python.  Go to the apple->force quit in the menu bar and kill any python and idle processes.  Then try it again.You do need to use idle3 instead of idle to get the version they want in this cours., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 11:05 am -04:00,Since a TA replied to the post and suggested there were issues with the code more reports are better.  I find your suggestion to be not helpful.   I also suggest you quit making aspersions about other students., Resolved Locked,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 11:03 am -04:00,Im having the same issues.  Its not even grading as correct a function that graded correct last evening.People should learn never to make a change to code on the weekends when no on is around to fix it...:), Resolved Locked,-1
Sunday September 1st 2013 11:21 am -04:00,What a poor answer.  Youre conjecturing that the students are doing a denial of service to a course in a in a school that has a CS program?  I would assume that that would be the last thing that would happen.If you have any real answer please post it., Resolved Locked,-2
