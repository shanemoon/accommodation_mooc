Monday August 19th 2013 1:29 am -04:00,Hello everyone and greeting from the US I am a 47 year old disabled person trying to restart my life. I have built computers for personal use and repaired them for others. I never went to college I am now on the path to one day in the near future of earning a degree in computer sciences.  As a side note I have a daughter that is entering her senior year of high school and one that is starting her junior year I want to show them and understand a person is never to old to learn as long as they are determined to learn. I look forward to chatting and sharing ideas with everyone. Russell,None,5
