Saturday August 31st 2013 8:25 am -04:00,hi every oneI am using idle from the beginning of the course.This morning i was working on it and then it froze.When I restarted idle that message appearedIDLEs subprocess didnt make connection. Either etc.I uninstalled it and re-installed but the same message appeared.I tried by the terminal and it works but I dont know how to open a new window to write for example def convert etc.I am pretty sure its not because of a firewall or something else I have no antivirus or something similar to on my mac (mac os 10.6)Does someone have an idea to fix it ?I thought about an clean uninstallation but I dont know how to do it ...AmauryÂ , Unresolved,0
