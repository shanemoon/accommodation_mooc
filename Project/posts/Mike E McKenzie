Tuesday September 24th 2013 12:23 pm -04:00,I marked this option as correct: for line in file:        if letter in line:            matches.append(line.rstrip())because I tried it in the Python shell and used the Flanders poem txt as an example but it got marked wrong. Anybody know why thanks, Resolved,0
