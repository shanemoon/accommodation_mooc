Friday October 4th 2013 11:26 pm -04:00,I understand the correct answer is 27004383 but how do you do using a the loop?  I am struggling and I am sooo far behind!I have done the simple example as suggested (tried in visualizer and it prints 25) but I am not sure how to do the actual question as I cant list all numbers from 1523 to 10504. Thanks.L = [12345678910]sum = 0i = 0while i < len(L) and L[i] % 2 == 1:    sum = sum + L[i]     i = i + 2    print(sum), Resolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 10:29 am -04:00,SergeyThanks for responding but you havent answered my question.  Looking for answer for the sum of the odd numbers from 1523 through 10503 inclusive.  I think I will repost as a new question so someone sees this., Resolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 11:04 am -04:00,Thanks Sergey and Alain!   In visualizer it is giving me a stopped after 300 steps to prevent possible infinite loop) error i.e. it is not displaying the final answer. Are you sure this is the way one is supposed to do this?I eventually figured out Python shell - didnt realize one has to hit the enter key so many times before the print(sum).  , Resolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 12:03 pm -04:00,Thanks - Ive taken out the code but I thought they said after hard deadline we can post code but we need to use some external software for this.  Not sure why. Its much simpler to post it here., Resolved,0

Friday September 27th 2013 1:53 pm -04:00,Is it step 3 or 4 (or both) that is causing the problem? Maybe you should post your entire a2., Resolved,0
