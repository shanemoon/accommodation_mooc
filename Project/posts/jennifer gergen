Monday September 9th 2013 11:31 pm -04:00,I understand that word is the best choice because it is more specific than any of the other multiple choice options but the function can work on any string right? So if you ask count_vowels(I hate nitpickers) the english translation Count the number of vowels in the the word I hate nitpickers. doesnt make sense. This is why i hastily chose input as my first answer to the question but of course we dont like input because its completely meaningless and gives me no idea what kind of input it wants.But we dont like count_vowels(string) right? Because its also not specific enough?Maybe count_vowels(phrase)? What if my string is an email address?Â , Unresolved,0
