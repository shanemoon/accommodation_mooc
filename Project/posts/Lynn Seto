Sunday September 8th 2013 10:47 pm -04:00,I too am so incredibly frustrated with this course! It is clearly NOT for beginners. It has taken me hours to get to 15/18 on this exercise and I still have no idea what Im doing wrong with 14 and 15. Half the time I dont even understand why I get stuff right!  I havent even begun week 3 material and the assignment might as well be in Klingon.  The hints are terrible so making mistakes is not helping because the feedback in the form of a question explanation is awful. I have read through the discussion boards and watched videos multiple times and it just does not make sense.I have tried return (countvowels(word) + count consonants(word))return ((countvowels(word) + count consonants(word)), Resolved,1
Sunday September 8th 2013 10:49 pm -04:00,Ugh! It just changed the format I originally typed it in. I typed it as count underscore vowels + count underscore consonants in the varied parentheses, Resolved,0

Sunday September 8th 2013 11:16 pm -04:00,I tried it both ways because it didnt work with single parentheses. I thought I was calling only the needed functions.   I just dont get this :-(, Resolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 11:17 pm -04:00,I also tried it w/o any parentheses..., Resolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 11:56 pm -04:00,Tom re your 2+3 analogy I thought that is what I did. I will try it agin with no parentheses...Alan re Run the module and then call the count_letters() function from the Python Shell in IDLE to see if your syntax is correct.  What is running a module? I dont know what that is..., Resolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 12:11 am -04:00,No I havent done that. Is that part of week three?  Im still way behind because its taken me so long to get through weeks 1&2..  Is there a difference between the shell and the module? , Resolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 12:21 am -04:00,I remember the lectures talking about .py files. Didnt realize it was the same thing.  Aybe I can actually try the assignment now.., Resolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 12:05 am -04:00,Finally got it! Thanks for the help. :-), Resolved,1
