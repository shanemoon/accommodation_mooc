Monday September 16th 2013 2:50 pm -04:00,Im packing for one week of hiking and just discovered that this week there is no due date and hard deadline. Instead its a hard deadline next monday. As the videos came online only today there was no way for me to do the work before. Please tell me that this is a mistake... , Resolved,1
