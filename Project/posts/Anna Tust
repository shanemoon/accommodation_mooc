Wednesday September 11th 2013 8:09 am -04:00,HiI have a problem with Step 2 in A1 with seconds_difference.Sorry if this has been posted already but I added the return expression to a1.py (difference between time_2 and time_1 but after saving and running the module when I copy & paste seconds_difference(3600.0 1800.0) to the shell I get nothing back. The only way I get the answer -1800.0 is if I type the function definition and return statement to the shell itself. Is this what I am supposed to do or am I doing something wrong?, Resolved,0
