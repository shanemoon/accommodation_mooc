Monday August 26th 2013 4:29 pm -04:00,Here is the Questions We can convert t degrees Fahrenheit to t degrees Celsius like this: (t - 32) * 5 /9. Let’s use this information to try to solve our problem.>>> room_temperature_c = 20>>> cooking_temperature_f = 350>>> oven_heating_rate_c = 20>>> oven_heating_time = (... ((cooking_temperature_f - 32) * 5 / 9) - room_temperature_c) / \... oven_heating_rate_c>>> oven_heating_time7.833333333333333I have tried this multiple times and could not get this floating number. Can someone please advise?,None,0
Monday August 26th 2013 4:30 pm -04:00,Here is what i tried>>> roomTemp=20>>> cookingTemp=350>>> OvenHeatingRate=20>>> OvenHeatingTime= (((cookingTemp - 32)*5/9)		  )>>> OvenHeatingTime176.66666666666666>>> (350 - 32) * 5/9176.66666666666666,None,0
Monday August 26th 2013 5:19 pm -04:00,This is the formula you used to receive that answer(((cooking_temperature_f - 32) * 5 / 9) - room_temperature_c) / oven_heating_rate_cprint(oven_heating_time)This may be where i messed up at,None,0

Please Respond(BOOK SAYS)total = 0>>> for i in range(1 101):... total = total + i...>>> total5050(WHEN I TRIED USING PYTHON PROGRAM)>>> total = 0>>> for i in range(1 101):	total = total + 1	>>> total100>>> , Resolved,0
