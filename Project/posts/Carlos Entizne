Sunday August 18th 2013 10:42 pm -04:00,I find really useful to be able to run Python programs online via any web browser and on any OS even from my mobile.LINK EDITED with the version 3 (thanks to Devin Kott)http://www.compileonline.com/execute_python3_online.phpOf course it is better to have it installed in your machine but for this course I think that the online version is more than enough and solves many installation problems since you do no have to install anything.PS: the link is only for python but in the same site (top right languages) you can access to MANY different programming languages that you can execute online, Resolved,2
Sunday August 18th 2013 11:00 pm -04:00,100% agree. Many times I found myself lost in a tutorial because I did not use exactly the same software for whatever reason. However link above is very handy for those who use several machines or even follow the course with a tablet., Resolved,1
