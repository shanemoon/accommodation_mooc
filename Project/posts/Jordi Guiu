Thursday September 26th 2013 2:11 pm -04:00,My code works with the examples and everything i throw at it... but i get these errors:TEST1Method Description:NoneMessage:FAILURE: AssertionError<class str> !=  : Expected a bool to be returned.And this TEST2Method Description:NoneMessage:FAILURE: AssertionErrorTrue != True : Wrong result returned.TEST3Method Description:NoneMessage:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse != False : Wrong result returned. Consider what happens with the words BEEP and BEEPS.This example i tried and works BEEPS gets not counted. I changed False to Word not foundI wonder what is wrong if the results are ok..THanks!!!, Resolved,0
