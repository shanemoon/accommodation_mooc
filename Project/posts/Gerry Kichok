Friday September 13th 2013 11:31 am -04:00,I understand the point of this exercise as explained by this:Return True if and only if the string is valid (that is in this case it contains no characters other than A T C and G).but my common sense tells me this is correct that this is correct>>> is_valid_sequence()    Falsenot>>> is_valid_sequence()    Truewhich is INCORRECT for this assignment!If the point was to teach us that no other characters is different from containing only these characters it was poorly illustrated in this assignment.I believe this was more about using these forums to discuss our code OR more importantly:    How working in isolation for a programmer leads to assumptions that may prove incorrect!If the above point was left as a HINT in the assignment it would have made me happier to see I had made a mistake working in isolation rather than being frustrated and confused reading through wiki about DNA looking for any reference to an empty DNA sequence! We are all here to learn The Fundamentals of Programming and not The Fundamentals of DNA. Please just add this small hint., Resolved,2

The M in smiles would be a far better example.More str operators (2:16)Select the expression(s) that produce True.mile in smilesI in smilessmiles in smileslimes in smiles, Unresolved,0
