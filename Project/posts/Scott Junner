Monday August 19th 2013 1:51 am -04:00,It just so happens I can get a copy of the previous iteration of the text book Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science using Python. For a few bucks at a local second hand dealer.Since I would be using it for extra study. Is it worth employing or would problems arise given it is for Python not Python 3?, Resolved,1
Tuesday August 20th 2013 4:59 am -04:00,I bought the latest in the end. All good., Resolved,1
Saturday August 24th 2013 6:54 am -04:00,My choice to buy the new book was because the course is written by the same people who wrote both editions of the book and it makes sense to keep in line with them to get the best learning experience. There are lots of free resources. But the course and the book go together. Youll see that once you start reading the suggested text., Resolved,1

Being in Australia we are GMT + 10 which puts us in a very different time zone.Added to that I live in a remote area so I got Buckleys chance of attending a physical study group. But...da da da da da da daaaa... Google+ Hangouts saves the day.

Wednesday August 21st 2013 1:28 am -04:00,Ive written the following code and cant seem to get it to run in the shell from my .py file.def absolute(a b):Returns an absolute number from any two given numbersdef absolute(number number) -> absolute number>>> absolute(3 -5)15>>> absolute(-2 7)14>>> absolute(-2.5 20)50    return abs(a * b)error message: Expected an indented block.Looks indented to me. But if I type the code straight into the shell the code works just fine.Any ideas?,None,0

Wednesday August 21st 2013 7:38 am -04:00,Ill get rid of the notes and try it again.,None,0
Wednesday August 21st 2013 7:44 am -04:00,Ok. I fixed it. started again and wrote the code only without the notes. This allowed for proper indentation of the block.Then I inserted the notes in between. Ran this and it worked fine.,None,0

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 5:35 am -04:00,unfortunately hints arent working for me here because I feel like I did exactly what is being hinted at. Yet I got it wrong.
