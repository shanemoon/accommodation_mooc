Monday August 19th 2013 11:22 pm -04:00,Watching the video Jennifer had the old window on the left and the new window on the right. Then she clicks Run Module on her left-maybe that is just a MAC thing but I only had the Run option on the new window.Anyway that is not the point when I clicked Run Module BOTH windows immediately shut down-just closed/disappeared.Any help would be greatly appreciated!, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 12:18 am -04:00,Hi RenataYeah that is what I am trying to say-in the window representing the py file.  Yes Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium OS. 16 GB of RAM- so no shortage there! lol  And yes-as I was watching her video I was going along with her and  she did the Run Module so I did the Run Module and *POOF* No more shell or window-only the Coursera Video in FF lol. Very frustrating though as I am taking 2 programming classes at once so I have to stay on top of them and get as much done as possible in case I run into a rough spot that takes more of my attention. I am not positive not interested in replicating the problem but I think I may have had the >>> in my new window-not sure if that can cause a crash or not?I just went back and tried again and it worked fine., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 1:08 am -04:00,I am not asking for the answer I am only asking what its asking for?The reason I am confused is because it says: What value does x refer to?When thinking value-I want to solve for x and give a numerical number.However with it saying refer I think of a sentence describing what x stands for in the expression. The value is...# but it refers to...a total phrase/sentence...See why I am confused?,None,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 3:41 am -04:00,What address Christiaan? Python is automated so we do not know the addresses.In American English when you refer to something you are giving mention/going back to the main/original thing-that is the only reason I asked. Therefore it would have meant to answer that it went back to the variable. However referring does not answer a problem most times.For me the formula was equating to something; for me adding summing equating and so on are the terms to let me know I am solving for x.This is like beating a dead horse-I figured out they wanted me to solve for x so I did. lol,None,1

Wednesday August 28th 2013 1:25 pm -04:00,Hi PingI learned HTML so much differently. First I learned the design recipe then I learned how to make things happen. This playing around then learning the recipe then going back and forth in it then asking us to do something we have not seen or done yet-it has me muddled up as well. Heck I am still confused on some of the terminology because a couple times they used different words for the same thing.So back to this problem I can see the order the 2 need to be placed but why were there   around the string? And I wasnt even sure it needed return-what helps me to decide these two things?, Unresolved,0

Tuesday August 27th 2013 4:08 am -04:00,Hi NancyYes that was the problem! It took me several minutes and then I finally thought about that.
