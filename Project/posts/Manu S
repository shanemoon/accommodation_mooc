Thursday September 12th 2013 9:40 am -04:00,HiMy is_valid_sequence function is like this:def is_valid_sequence(dna):     (str) -> bool    Return True if and only if the DNA sequence is valid (that is it contains no characters other than A T C and G).    >>> is_valid_sequence(ActG)    True    >>> is_valid_sequence(ACTG)    True    >>> is_valid_sequence(ABHIKTG)    False    >>> is_valid_sequence(ACTGGTCATGGTA)    True    >>>         [~ep]But I lost 2 marks on this function for:student: test_a2.TestIsValidSequence.test_is_valid_sequence_invalid_capital_letterFAILURE[x]Method Description:Have you tested your function with an invalid capital letter?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not false : Have you tested your function with an invalid capital letter?student: test_a2.TestIsValidSequence.test_is_valid_sequence_lowercaseFAILURE[x]Method Description:Have you tested your function with lowercase letters?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not false : Have you tested your function with lowercase letters?Anyone please help me to understand my mistake?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 9:43 am -04:00,OK so what aboutHave you tested your function with an invalid capital letter?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 9:45 am -04:00,I added this lowercase [actg] only because of that failure occured on my 1st submission, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 9:48 am -04:00,I am returning it as string:return False, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 9:50 am -04:00,Do I need to return it as False or False?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 9:58 am -04:00,OK thank you let me submit my code once again, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 10:13 am -04:00,Its working fine :), Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 9:42 am -04:00,HiMy get_complementary_sequence function is:[Code removed ~ep]I lost 3 marks on this code:student: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_emptyFAILURE[x]Method Description:Have you tested your function on a zero-length sequence?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorNone !=  : Have you tested your function on a zero-length sequence?student: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_handout_exampleFAILURE[x]Method Description:Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorNone != TA : Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?student: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_longFAILURE[x]Method Description:Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences        of each nucleotide?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorNone != TAGCTAGC : Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences            of each nucleotide?Anyone please help me to sort this out?Thanks, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 9:57 am -04:00,Anyone please help me to sort out my mistakes:My function is def get_complementary_sequence(dna):    (str) -> str    Return the DNA sequence that is complementary to the given DNA sequence.        >>> get_complementary_sequence(ACTG)    TGAC    >>> get_complementary_sequence(ACACTGTG)    TGTGACAC    >>> get_complementary_sequence(TGGTACCT)    ACCATGGA    >>> get_complementary_sequence(TACTACT)    ATGATGA    student: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_handout_exampleFAILURE[x]Method Description:Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorNone != TA : Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?student: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_longFAILURE[x]Method Description:Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences        of each nucleotide?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorNone != TAGCTAGC : Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences            of each nucleotide?student: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_emptyFAILURE[x]Method Description:Have you tested your function on a zero-length sequence?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorNone !=  : Have you tested your function on a zero-length sequence?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 10:01 am -04:00,What is expecting for a null string?>>> get_complementary_sequence()>>> get_complementary_sequence( )>>> Have you tested your function on a zero-length sequence?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 10:05 am -04:00,yeah now it is:>>> get_complementary_sequence( )>>> get_complementary_sequence()is that is expecting?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 10:07 am -04:00,Method Description:Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences        of each nucleotide?I already tested multiple occurrence why it is showing as a mistake?>>> get_complementary_sequence(TGGTACCT)    ACCATGGA, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 10:12 am -04:00,Yep I used only one print and I changed it to return.May I know why it is showing error when I use print instead of return?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 10:09 am -04:00,Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?I already tested the handout example>>> get_complementary_sequence(AT)    TAstill why it is showing as a mistake?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 10:12 am -04:00,Yep, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 10:13 am -04:00,Now I have cleared all the points :)Thanks a lot :), Resolved,0
