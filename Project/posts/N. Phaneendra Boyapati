Monday September 2nd 2013 12:29 pm -04:00, If u allow me to guess i think they have set in the way that as soon as the clock hits 8.59.00 AM the assignment submitted will be considered as late submission. so it will be better to send before it. Mon 2 Sep 2013 5:59 PM CEST (UTC +0200)If you submit any time after the hard deadline you will not receive credit.Buddy ur deadline is over so its under late submission so u wont get credits, Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 12:36 pm -04:00,Mon 26 Aug 2013 8:59 AM PDT (UTC -0700)We recommend submitting before the due date to keep you on track. However you can submit any time before the hard deadline without late penalty.As u can see they never said they will consider as submitting on time if we submit at 8.59 AM. , Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:39 pm -04:00,u are the writing the return statement for to_float_hours function right?. so u cant call the header in the return type. remove it just give return ((hours)+(minutes / 60)+ (seconds/3600))it will work.. any other things let me know. :), Unresolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:28 pm -04:00,return to_float_hours((hours) + (minutes/60.0) + (seconds/3600.0))If u see the example in the program the return value is single value so no need to use commas and no need to call to_float_hours thats the function name. so it shows run time error. In return u should not call the same function u can call other functions. so remove it it will solve your problem. , Unresolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 9:32 pm -04:00,No need to plug in seconds_to_24_clock in my get_hours function. all u need to do is Return the number of hours that have elapsed since midnight as seen on a 24-hour clockexample:     >>> get_hours(3800)    1    >>> get_hours(7600)    2    , Unresolved,0
