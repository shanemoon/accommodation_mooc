Thursday September 5th 2013 6:31 am -04:00,Did you put a colon : at the end of def if there is no colon it would give an error. Type the statement in IDLE put the first option in place of # missing function body then continue with the other statements if you dont the correct result copy and paste then edit the first option to the next option. One option is surely the answer., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 7:19 am -04:00,I get an error like that when the code I am trying to run is not or different from the one in python memory if you get what I mean. I suggest you run all the statements at once or open a new window save them and then run the module. In that new window you can edit the options one after the other but remember to save and run the module after each edit., Unresolved,0
