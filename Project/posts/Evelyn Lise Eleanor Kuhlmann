Saturday August 24th 2013 4:27 pm -04:00,the syntax error could be based on my current understanding of the rules the lack of spaces between commands. Expressions should be written:def area(base height):    return base * height / 2also your variable AREA should be written:area(15 20)Hope this helps,None,1
Monday September 16th 2013 12:17 am -04:00,I found it was changed once I hit the submit button. What was sent was not exactly what I submitted my answers were changed by the grader! (particularly the last question). Going to take another attempt and see what happens., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 4:12 pm -04:00,lol... I was wondering this very thing last night! After spending 30 mins looking for a calculator I remembered that Python IS a calculator! So I opened the shell and simply created this formula:>>> (100.0 / 16.0) * 14.0 * .0516.0 represents the total possible score.14.0 represents the score obtained out of the possible 16.0..05 represents the weighted average (an Exercise).All I did was changed the relevant figures for possible score its related score obtained and the designated weighted average for that particular submission. Add the results and Presto! ... Currently holding at 85.1% after completion of Assignment 2.I agree had I been thoroughly ambitious I would have attempted scripting a program to run this. However I have committed my brain-storming to a unique but simple game Im engineering (I call it CuByss - as in Cube + Abyss) which I am hoping to fashion through what Im learning here., Resolved,1
Sunday September 22nd 2013 4:02 am -04:00,I searched our forum base and found an example of having the computer generate a random number. What if I want to give a list of items to the computer and have it randomly select one?For example what if I wanted to list every card in a standard 52-card pack and have the computer randomly pick 1 of the 52 cards?,None,1
Sunday September 22nd 2013 4:03 pm -04:00,Ty both Henry and Anon. I suspected it to be something like what you have both shown here. My objective is to take an ancient proven system (used by Alexander the Great) and reproduce it electronically for public use world-wide. The system employs 27 binary-based objects. It is simple enough when used IRL and I think it shouldnt be too difficult to set to code. Ty for providing me with some clarity as to how to proceed. Im not sure if a future lecture will touch on this aspect of Python programming.,None,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 4:20 pm -04:00,I just signed up for the Interactive Programming in Python course through Rice University starting Oct 7 2013 which focuses on game designing with Python. It is pure synchronicity that I read both your answers thought Yep that makes perfect sense. What next? and then I got the email offering the interactive programming in Python! Suffice it to say I wont have to badger you guys for help moving forward as much as I thought I might! lol Good for us all ;-),None,1

Monday September 23rd 2013 3:15 am -04:00,AlainThank you for taking the time to show me this. I understand where youre going with this. However .shuffle and .pop will either set a fixed order for the [cards] and present them one at a time based on the shuffled list or remove cards. Ideally we want to generate a random pick each time even if that means the same [card] is presented two random draws in a row.To be a little more precise: Imagine a shaman hunched at a small mound of earth. The shaman reaches into a sac at his waist and removes a small number of stones (of many) therein. He then tosses these stones (like dice) atop the mound of earth. Some roll down the edge of the mound. Some stack on top of each other. Some group together while others sit lonely. Some stones are upside down as others lay right-side up.To the shaman each stone - how it lays where it lays if it is closer or farther in proximity upside down etc. - tells something specific means something exact.In my projected scenario the user is the shaman the computer screen is the mound of earth and the RANDOM command becomes the choosing then tossing of the stones. The user then mouses over any readable stones and its meaning pops.What I am actually doing is far simpler but you get the gist: 27 stones (3**3) 54 possible definitions 1 stone drawn randomly 1 definition for the stone drawn. Rinse and repeat. :-)And yes I understand that this type of project is OOP based on what Ive been learning and researching so far.In the end comparing what I conceived I would code and what you have input it seems I am heading in the right direction at least.Again thank you for replying. Theres no rush but my emphasis is on [kerning] what I need to learn versus what I can learn. This project of mine is about er um 15 years overdue. That you have confirmed I am proceeding accordingly is a great relief.,None,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 1:00 pm -04:00,Alain: you got it! I was thinking about creating a description for each stone (face-up rightside up) as well as the other 2 positions (face-down; face-up upside down) giving 81 possible returns assign each description to a numeric value and randomly choose the number to populate the corresponding printed message. As I already wrote the book and it is stored in my computer I can just import all the descriptions into the code. At least thats what Im thinking. And as you imply it should be relatively simple. Just time-consuming to code and test.Anon:Um you can choose to look at it that way but the science is over 7000 years old and is binary-based. In fact BINARY in itself is based on the same system: 0 (the feminine principle egg womb) and the 1 (masculine principle sperm phallus). This is the very basis of AI electronically: the development of the embryo. Some of historys greatest conquerors used these methods WITHOUT FAIL. As I mentioned earlier Alexander the Great was a firm patron - he based every decision he made on an already thousands-year-old proven system. It is this system that I plan to recreate. I have personally tested the system since 1997 on 10s of thousands of people. In 2001 & 2002 I tested over 20000 people! Always accurate. Theres a lot to be said for binary systems (which are perpetually current). ;-),None,0
