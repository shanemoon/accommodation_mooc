Sunday September 29th 2013 12:55 am -04:00,After several hours I am admitting that I need help.  I know that I need to loop twice and create 2 variables but I cannot remember how to append the second to the first.  Here is my code that I at least get a string of letters only not separated into lists of characters.  What is lacking?  (2nd variable is not in the below code).    board =             for line in board_file:        for s in line:            if s !=():                board.append(s.rstrip())     return board, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 3:19 am -04:00,Thank you.  Yes I know that I needed two of loops lists and appends (which I did not have above but that were in and out of the code many many times in testing).  The above gave me the best result before I added another list or append and received a worse result.  It came to be all about the order of everything.  The problem I was having was not getting them backwards in the appends.  After an hour away from the problem I came back and worked through the appends really slow.  I finally received a satisfactory result and 37/37.  Than you again for your input again.  I was getting really frustrated and very very tired at 2:00 am., Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 3:50 pm -04:00,Hi Tom.  I never took it that way.  You actually helped me very much in confirming what I was doing.  I guess at that point I was so tired and frustrated that I could couldnt append anything to anything else :-)..  it is best to walk away for awhile and come back fresh for a second look.  Thanks again., Resolved,0
