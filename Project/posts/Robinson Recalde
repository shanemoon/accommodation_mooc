Friday September 6th 2013 9:21 am -04:00,Greetings!I am here to ask for a permission to submit my First assignment late my reason is simple: I am in a course of mountaneering since October 2012 back in July we did our first journey to a Mountain outside our own city (I live in Caracas and we use to go to the Avila to practice camping etc) we went to Mérida (Venezuela) and go to the Sierra la Culata which is a cordillera very beautiful and high (we reached a 4680 msn[I believe this is how in english I can say above level sea) peak) and today I will be traveling to Mérida again to the Sierra Nevada national Park which is a part of the famous Cordillera de los Andes. We are going to go to the Humboldt peak which is the second highest peak of Venezuela with a 4.940 msn. This week I was not able to see the lectures to practice any programming and start the first Assignment. I will be back in 7 days if everything develop ok. I will be wating for your answers I will be in the bus to Mérida in like 7 hours so thank you for reading this and for giving me one of the best MOOC of my life!Kind regards Robinson Recalde., Unresolved,0
