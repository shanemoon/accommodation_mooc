Monday August 19th 2013 7:48 pm -04:00,My understanding is that Python 2.x is still the more common version but that Python 3.x is superior as a version. Either way I think the point is to learn about thinking and working with a programming language rather than getting hung up on the question of which version is better.  The internet is full of pointless arguments about which programming language is best. Id rather spend my time improving my programming skills given that life is already too short for us to achieve everything we might wish., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 1:48 pm -04:00,Python is completely independent of Coursera.  You can work on the course material (or just practice on your own) using the IDLE interpreter.  You can copy and paste code into and from IDLE using the edit button on the shell menu or in a new window.    You might find it helpful to pin the IDLE program to your taskbar for ease of access.  I hope this helps., Resolved,0
Wednesday August 21st 2013 9:12 pm -04:00,I think the answer to the first part is no - logically you cant have memory addresses for memory addresses without creating an infinite regress.On the second question of whether  the variable name stores a memory address which points to another memory space in which the value is stored the lecture seems to be saying that the variable name contains a memory address via which it refers/points to a value. That value has the same memory address as the one contained in the variable. However the lecture makes clear that Python keeps track of variables in a separate area of memory from values.  If you like the memory address shared by the variable and the value is the bridge between those two areas of memory., Resolved,0

Saturday August 24th 2013 10:04 am -04:00,Actually the screen without prompts is the file editing window.   You wouldnt want to refer to it by the name of the python script you are running in it because no-one else would know what you meant by e.g. the triangle.py window. For more official Python information you can read up on IDLE here:http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/idle.html, Resolved,1
Wednesday August 21st 2013 9:17 pm -04:00,Would it be reasonably accurate to say that the memory address contained by a variable and which a value has acts as a bridge between two areas of memory? Thus when you pass a variable into a function what you are effectively doing is connecting the function to the value of the variable by opening the bridge for traffic if youll allow me a metaphor.  , Resolved,0
Saturday August 24th 2013 9:53 am -04:00,I would suggest that you right click on the IDLE icon and have it pin IDLE to your taskbar.  I think this would achieve the result you desire., Unresolved,0
Friday August 23rd 2013 8:43 am -04:00,I think youll find that this isnt a Python error.  Perhaps the discussions here might help:http://robertmarkbramprogrammer.blogspot.de/2008/01/xxx-is-not-recognized-as-internal-or.htmlhttp://superuser.com/questions/25037/change-environment-variables-as-standard-user-windows-7/25038#25038, Resolved,0
Saturday August 24th 2013 7:17 am -04:00,When it says 7 weekly exercises it means that there will be one exercise for each of the 7 weeks not 7 exercises for each week.   Each week there will be an exercise which will be made available with the lectures for that week.,None,3
Sunday August 25th 2013 7:59 pm -04:00,There are 2 types of Python function:1) Built-in functions.These are functions that are already defined as part of Pythons basic set of functions that are available for you to use without you needing to create them - for example max() and min(). 2) Functions you define for yourselfImagine you want to use a function that returns the perimeter and area of a triangle.  There is no such function in the set of built-in Python functions so you have to define it for yourself something like this:def (parameters):     function body     return perimeter and area of triangle(Note that this isnt an actual working function just an example of what a function defined by you might look like).The official documentation on built-in Python 3 functions can be found here:http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.htmlI hope this helps., Unresolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 9:42 pm -04:00,Right. Its important to note that the sequence of assignment statements matters here.  y = abs(x) cannot refer to the assignment statement x = 11 that follows it.  It has to refer to the (value assigned to) x in the line of code before it., Unresolved,1
Monday August 26th 2013 9:34 pm -04:00,Leigh reading through the code youve cited theres nothing in it to produce a TypeError.  There isnt any point at which you ask it to do more than add the values referred to by the variables (all of which are defined) and then finally assign a value to new_result.   Once you ask for the value of new_result it gives it to you., Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 10:10 am -04:00,The information contained in docstrings doesnt affect the actual running or result of a program in Python.  The change to float is to make your type contract more precise.  Since division using \ produces floats (and since many of the results you return will be floats not integers) it makes sense to have this in your type contract.  In theory you could leave the docstring the way it is but that would mean getting less accurate help on your function when you needed it., Resolved,1
Monday September 30th 2013 11:11 pm -04:00,I took the edx MIT Python course - and it is very thorough very demanding and very good.  Be prepared to put in a lot of hours every week to do the problem sets and exercises. The second half of the course gets pretty complex so dont assume that you can coast through it on the basis of the elementary knowledge you have picked up here.  The exams can be quite brutal.,None,0
