Monday August 26th 2013 6:48 pm -04:00,HiReally enjoying the course so far but I think I have found an error in your assignment examples. to_float_hours(2 45 9) should return 2.7515 and not 2.7525 as stated in a1.py.Similarly to_float_hours(1 0 36) should return 1.006 and not 1.01.Hope this helps, Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 7:17 pm -04:00,Odd. If you work it out 45 minutes is 0.75 hours and 9 seconds is 0.15 minutes so therefore 2 hours 45 minutes and 9 seconds should equal 2.7515.2.7525 equals 2 hours 45 minutes and 15 seconds.*** edit *** or maybe not. Its after midnight here so that could be playing tricks with my brain. Ill check again in the morning., Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 7:31 pm -04:00,Sorry deleted that because it looked like a double post.My thanks to both of you for your help. Serves me right for trying to code when tired. At least I know I have errors in my code before I submit it now., Resolved,1

Tuesday September 10th 2013 6:29 pm -04:00,Yes the error is in the function name not your code. Its get_complementary_sequencenotget_complimentary_sequenceThe difference between the I and E is what is causing the error.  , Resolved,1
Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:34 pm -04:00,a2.py only contains code for part 2. For parts 3 and 4 you have to write your own functions., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:27 pm -04:00, As an alternative you can use code that was mentioned in the For loop over str video., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:22 pm -04:00,*** Edit ***I was looking at the wrong function. insert_sequence was fine but my contains_sequence was wrong. Massive reading fail on my end. Thank you to everyone that posted.*** End Edit ***Im having a problem with the insert_sequence function. According to all my testing it works fine but it fails the submission test. Has this happened to anyone else? I would post my code but Im certain it works properly. Instead here are my test cases:>>> insert_sequence(AAA GT 0)GTAAA>>> insert_sequence(AAA GT 1)AGTAA>>> insert_sequence(AAA GT 2)AAGTA>>> insert_sequence(AAA GT 3)AAAGTI dont understand why test_a2.TestContainsSequence.test_contains_sequence_at_beginning fails and yet test_a2.TestContainsSequence.test_contains_sequence_at_endpasses.*** Edit ***Thanks everyone that replied to this. I know I can change the code to a much simpler one and I probably will just to get the extra mark. However this does not answer the main question: if the index is 0 then why does return dna2 + dna1 fail? If anyone can answer that I will be very happy., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:00 pm -04:00,Thanks for the help. The thing is my code does produces the correct answer as Ive shown in my example above.I just dont understand why it is failing the grader when it does appear to be giving the correct answer. , Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 4:29 am -04:00,To Angel Tom and Charmalee those solutions are using str methods which we were explicitly told not to use.I have three If statements:if(index equals zero) -  beginning of sequenceelif(index equals length) - end of sequenceelif(index somewhere in the middle) - insert at correct placeLike I keep saying it does return the correct answer. Those examples above were produced by my function. I have no idea why this is failing., Unresolved,2
Wednesday September 11th 2013 5:33 pm -04:00,Pretty sure my complicated version did check for that. If the index was <= 0 then dna2 is at the beginning of dna1. If index >= length dna2 is at the end of dna1. I would really really like to see what the test is for this one. Both my overly complicated method and the one line method give me the correct answer when I test them. Maybe the grader just doesnt like me., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:59 am -04:00,I am using the code you listed above which is why I dont see why it isnt working. Forget inserting in the middle. Why does return dna1 + dna2 work for inserting at the end when return dna2 + dna1 doesnt work for inserting at the beginning. Surely they should either both work or both fail. That is what I am asking about.I will change my code if I have to but I want to know why this method is not working first. *** Edit ***I care because I want to know why it isnt working. If I dont know why then Im probably going to run in to similar situations in the future. Failing is part of learning but we must know why we fail., Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 11th 2013 5:42 pm -04:00,Submitted using both index == 0 and index <= 0 just in case that was causing the error. Both appear to return the correct answer under my testing but fail the grader., Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 6:48 pm -04:00,I cant believe I was looking at the wrong function. On the one hand I feel quite stupid for making such an obvious mistake. On the other it means my very complicated function which I wrote at 1am worked. Thank you Charmalee., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:21 pm -04:00,There is a way of doing it on one line. My method of using If and For statements does complicate the function unnecessarily. This thread is more for trying to work out why it fails the grader when does produce the correct answer (as far as I can tell).Several people have posted on this thread with partial solutions. Look closely at Martins post and see if that helps., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 7:34 pm -04:00,Ideally for creating examples you want to test each specific outcome. For example in the insert_sequence function there are three specific answers. The sequence is added at the front the sequence is added at the end and the sequence is added in the middle. Therefore you should have three examples showing the three behaviours. A fourth showing what happens with non-valid data would be useful. However for the Assignments we are to assume that all inputs are valid. (Except the one checking the function is_valid), Resolved,1
Thursday September 26th 2013 2:56 pm -04:00,It isnt. Its there to see what your program does if the word it is looking for DOESNT exist. From num_words_on_board:>>> num_words_on_board([[A N T T] [X S O B]] [ANT BOX SOB TO])3This method checks to see if these four words are in the gridANTTXSOBANT SOB and TO are there so it returns the answer 3. , Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 3:05 pm -04:00,I think your problem is that you are using:for i in words:This returns the list of words. What you want to be using is the length of list words. If that makes sense., Resolved,1
Friday September 27th 2013 2:57 pm -04:00,I got stuck on that for hours because I was adding an empty string to the end of Board and of course it wasnt throwing an error there it was throwing it in a different function. I must have rewritten board_contains_word_in_column and make_str_from_column six or seven times each., Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 3:28 am -04:00,Jennifer my code was creating a list that ended:[....   [J E P Q L Y N X D L]  ]  <- that last empty list was causing all the problems. So I added a couple of lines that checked to see if it was there then removed it if it was.For your problem you are adding empty space (  ) to the end of each line as Shreyash pointed out. You need to remove that., Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 11:14 am -04:00,Try breaking it down a bit rather than trying to write the whole function in one line. Something like:if <code>:    return Truereturn False, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 11:16 am -04:00,But since you are having the errorMessage:ERROR: IndexErrorlist index out of rangeThen I think you need to look at your function make_str_from_column. , Unresolved,0
