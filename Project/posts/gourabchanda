Tuesday August 20th 2013 12:49 am -04:00,Hi juanthe basic differnce between python 2.x and 3.x is there has been changes in various in built functions e.g print () in 3.x instead of print in 2.x . I would advise you to install both 2.x and 3.x so that you can see the differnce between the two versions .As far i know there has been drastic transition from 2.x to 3.x.Â regardsGourab,None,1
