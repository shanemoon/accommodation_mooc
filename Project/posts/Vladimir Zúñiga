Tuesday August 20th 2013 4:40 pm -04:00,Hi everyoneHere a little multiplication table using a for in loop:def m_table(x):    for a in range(110):        print (x*a=a*x),None,1
Friday August 23rd 2013 12:49 pm -04:00,I tried the same and only worked for me when I use the conditional structura inside a function:def compare(ab):    if a>b:        print(a)    else:        print(b)Should be another better solution but this works for now.I am not sure if you want to print the value of the variable or the variable name. But if you want to obtain the value then you shouldnt use quotes in the print statement.,None,2

Sunday August 25th 2013 2:22 pm -04:00,Hi.This is my first attempt. I tried a different approach using slices.def pyg(x):	vocales=[aeiou]	for pos in range(0len(x)):		if x[pos:pos+1] in vocales:			print x[pos:pos+len(x)]+x[0:pos]+ay			breakI am not sure about all the pyglatin rules but when I enter x as browser I obtain the same result that in the example (owserbray) so at least that part works.The slices are pretty simple. you define a start position  and end position and returns the characters between example:x=holax[0:1]=hSaludos,None,0
