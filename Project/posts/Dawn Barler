Monday September 2nd 2013 7:13 am -04:00,Another tip try to keep it as simple as possible.  I over think really bad and really this assignment seems to be about getting the math right.  Just keep trying.  You can also submit your assignment so you can use it as a sorta check system.  Hristina Stoykova I could kiss you LOL Ive been struggling with the math on the last two of the assignment and reading your post just helped a lot., Unresolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 7:27 pm -04:00,I get the right answer on this question when I run it in Python but either way I put it on the test I get it wrong.  So I re-watched the video and still am not getting it.  s[0]  This is Indexing?  and this s[0:3]  is slicing.  Am I at least correct about this?  I have to be totally wrong otherwise I dont understand why I keep getting this wrong.  Any help suggestions sites to read ect. would be helpful.Thanks, Resolved,2
