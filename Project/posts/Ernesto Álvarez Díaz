Wednesday August 28th 2013 3:47 am -04:00,Nope. I mean perhaps the grading is performed by Coursera with another test bench.I had some computer assignments (at my university) where the teachers give you a test bench in order to test that your program works properly but at the end they run another in order to test and give the final mark. So you can pass the availabale test bench but fail some of the tests in the other test bench., Resolved,0
