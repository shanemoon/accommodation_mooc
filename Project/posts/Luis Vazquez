Wednesday September 4th 2013 11:00 pm -04:00,Hello. I also joined the course at night on Sep 02 and missed the due date for Exercise 1 which was this very same day. The exercise was almost trivial and I submitted this on Sep 03 getting 15/15 but it will not count because I was late.I would be glad if there is any possibility for not lossing these points from these very first and very basic exercise.Thanks in advance ,None,1
