Tuesday September 10th 2013 11:11 pm -04:00,I was writing about Question 4 not Question 9. Question 4 is about showing a character in a string. All of the questions in Exercise 4 that I worked on were correct except Question 4. What I typed at the beginning of this thread worked in IDLE and should have worked in Question 4. Glad to know that my message was read. Thanks anyway., Unresolved,0
