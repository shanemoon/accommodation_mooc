Saturday September 14th 2013 7:37 am -04:00,Hi RachelA. The first two error message(insert_sequence) shows that the test program try to insert the sequence at beginning/end of the other sequence. e.g. insert AT at position 0 of ATCG will get ATATCG insert AT at position 4 of ATCG will get ATCGATThink your program only handle how to insert in between. B. Error 3(insert_sequence) and 4(get_complementary_sequence) and 6(get_complement) shows that your program fail to exercise the example in handout you may need to check your code.C. Error 5(get_complementary_sequence) shows that the test might use a really long sequence(may be 100+ char) to test your program and failed. So I guess your program can handle short sequence your need to make it possible to handle sequence of any lengthD. Failure 7(is_valid_sequence) is testing you program with a empty string  in this assignment this will be consider as a valid sequenceHope these will be helpful to you, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 2:47 pm -04:00,Hi Anna your problem comes with the two identical letters in a row.Since you use e.index(i) it will locate the first appearance of i in that particular row. if you have rows looks like [T T] the value evaluated will always be 0.To verify this you can test you code with column_index = 0 you should get a 3 letter string.Hint for you you can save the inner for loop. By evaluating e(column_index) you should get what you want.Hope these will help, Unresolved,0
