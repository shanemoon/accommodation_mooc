Monday September 16th 2013 11:07 am -04:00,no it says like that.but my function returns proper complement only>>> get_complementary_sequence(ACTG)TGAC>>> get_complementary_sequence(TACC)ATGG>>> get_complementary_sequence(AAAA)TTTTthese are some examples which i have run on python, Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 11:08 am -04:00, >>> get_complement(A)    T    >>> get_complement(C)    Gthese are for get_complement, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 2:11 pm -04:00,i m also facing the same problem...please help, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 2:20 pm -04:00,yes it works for these examples.is it mandatory to use get_complement function in this function? , Unresolved,0
