Monday September 9th 2013 1:08 am -04:00,So I see lots of responses to questions about Q6 Exercise 1. I have one question here -If I submit 1.71 as the answer representing value of x when x=12/7 the answer is marked wrong. Do I need to enterÂ 1.7142857142857142 which is the answer given in the Python shell?Pardon if question seems trivial but I just want to make sure my understanding is correct.Thanks,None,-1
