Wednesday August 21st 2013 5:04 am -04:00,Hi I am Monika from Dehradun.I found an interesting fact about python.It is one of the only languages Ive known in which there exists an Else clause for For loops. Its a special type of syntax that executes only if the for loop exits naturally without any break statements. Perhaps an example would be helpful:1234567def contains_even_number(l)    for elt in l:        if elt % 2 == 0:            print list contains an even number            break     else:             print list does not contain an even numberIn the above code the else condition will fire only if no elt in l is even. Otherwise it will not fire. Its interesting and unique to Python I think.,None,1
