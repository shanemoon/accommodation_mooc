Sunday September 29th 2013 7:07 pm -04:00,def update_score(player_info word):     ([str int] list str) -> NoneType    player_info is a list with the players name and score. Update player_info    by adding the point value word earns to the players score.    >>> update_score([Jonathan 4] ANT)    I am not sure what this function is exactly suppose to do. It is suppose to open a file and write the score into the file? Can somebody shed some light how am i suppose to approach this function? Thanks!!, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 12:53 am -04:00,So on update_score([Jonathan 4] ANT) the number 4 is the score? On what list variable are we suppose to update? Are we suppose to write on a file and update it on a file? I am confused. Please let me know if that question is answerable.. Thanks!, Unresolved,0
