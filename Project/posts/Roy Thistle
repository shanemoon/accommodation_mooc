Thursday August 29th 2013 4:11 pm -04:00,I just want to be sure about what number refers to in the function definitions.As far as I know number is not a type.So when the definition has number in it I take it from the lectures the could be a literal (a string of legal symbols 0 1 2 .  .....) of type Integer or Float; but not String or Complex (if that is a type in Python)?Is this so?, Unresolved,0
