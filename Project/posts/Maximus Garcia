Monday September 2nd 2013 10:47 am -04:00,I havent seen a thread for something like this yet and i thought it would be a good idea to make one. Im learning coding to make video games.also Im planning to learn java so i can mod because most of the games i play use java for instance Minecraft. and admins I have no idea if Minecraft is copyrighted or not so please dont delete.
