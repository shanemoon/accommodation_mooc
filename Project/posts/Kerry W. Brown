Wednesday August 21st 2013 8:18 am -04:00,In IDLE for Win 7 x64 I cant get call-tip popup to work automatically after typing functionName(` without manually using Ctrl+backslash.Does anyone have any info regarding rectifying this., Resolved,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 6:26 am -04:00,I just came in to check the 42/41 result as well :-)@Armia I dont think the additional submission is relevant ... at least it wasnt in my case where I only submitted one file.I like the option of selecting a file ... a lot simpler than pasting code., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 7:47 pm -04:00,I assume you mean this note in the Week 2 Exercise :->>In case you want extra practice here are suggested exercises from the textbook (these will not be marked):Chapter 3 exercises 9 10Chapter 4 exercises 1 2 3 5 6<<I agree that placing the note IN the exercise was a little unusual. Id have preferred the listing be somewhere more accessable., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 5:44 pm -04:00,For Staff.I have done something stupid.Ive overwritten my a1.py solution with the template.Can the file I submitted for  Assignment 1 be emailed to my registration email address?.I could re-do the Assignment for my own records but Im a little pushed for time and your assistance would be appreciated.Regards, Unresolved,0

Friday September 27th 2013 5:17 am -04:00,I gave assignment 3 to my partner to test (as one does) and to get her comments.She came back and said that some words werent accepted ... my answer was that the words werent in the official wordlist. It turned out that the word EAT is in the wordList but not on the board.We went looking for others that were not in the wordList and found a few.I decided to do what programmers are sposed to do : wrote a program.I have a wordList with 83667 words in it so I put it to use.We found 17 words with  3 or more characters., Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 8:44 pm -04:00,I cant see how { b: 3  a: 1  } can be incorrect.There is no inherent order for items in dictionaries.  Id be interested in staff input and comment on this question and an explanation on why anything other than  simply d[b] += 1 is required., Resolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 10:46 pm -04:00,That explanation isnt consistent with Question 1 Tom.The wording is exactly the same yet question 1 accepted an answer that is ordered differently to the result shown in the question. ie expected result  {a: 1 c: 3  b: 2 }  where I got a different result each time I run the statement ...  and it was marked correct . My Question 2 result matches the expected half the time so the evaluator may be looking at more than just the result.I tried both of these :print(Question 2  ===========================)d = {a: 1 b: 2}d[b] = d[b] + 1print( d)d = {a: 1 b: 2}d[b] += 1print( d)Which test locally as :Question 1  ==========================={a: 1 b: 2 c: 3}Question 2  ==========================={a: 1 b: 3}{a: 1 b: 3}Im not fussed about the half a percent deduction but Id like to know where my thinking is incorrect., Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 12:00 am -04:00,Im afraid I dont know what you are trying to say., Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 1:44 am -04:00,Sorry I dont see how the questions could be different. The core question for Q1 and Q2 are exactly the same. >>>> Write the missing assignment statement that modifies the dictionary as shown. (Just write the assignment statement; dont write the >>> part.)Well not exactly the same Q1 has the word that repeated ...Q1 has a key:value pair added.Q2 has the value associated with a key incremented.I dont understand your comment about not mutating. To change the dictionary it must be mutated.(or rebuilt and assigned to the same variable.), Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 9:21 pm -04:00,>>  so the autograder rejects itHenry is that from personal knowledge or is it a guess ??, Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 4:50 am -04:00,Im wondering if the requirement was to just overwrite the value at b by just adding it to the dictionary again .... ?ie:print( ===========================)d = {a: 1 b: 2}d.__setitem__(b 3)print( d)d = {a: 1 b: 2}d[b] = 3print( d), Resolved,0
