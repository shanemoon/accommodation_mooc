Wednesday August 28th 2013 11:37 am -04:00,I am a little bit confused. I have similar code to the one posted above:return round(time_2/60/60 - time_1/60/60 1)I have tried to run the test you have described an it works I have tried several combinations and each of them worked but after i submitted the assignment it tells me that it failed.I cannot understand why., Unresolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 11:50 am -04:00,But then I believe it is wrong as the example in the code states:>>> hours_difference(1800.0 2160.0)0.1When it actually is: >>> hours_difference(1800.0 2160.0)0.09999999999999998If decimals are not take into the consideration.This means that the description is wrong and misleading! :(, Unresolved,-2
Wednesday August 28th 2013 11:54 am -04:00,I have tried what Artyom has suggested and it worked I got score 41/41.I believe examples that are given are really misleading!!!, Unresolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:07 pm -04:00,That I understand.What confused me is following:def hours_difference(time_1 time_2):         (number number) -> float    Return the number of hours later that a time in seconds        time_2 is than a time in seconds time_1.                >>> hours_difference(1800.0 3600.0)        0.5       >>> hours_difference(3600.0 1800.0)       -0.5        >>> hours_difference(1800.0 2160.0)        0.1       >>> hours_difference(1800.0 1800.0)        0.0        the example that is already given in the code:>>> hours_difference(1800.0 2160.0)    0.1If you do not use the round function you do not get this result :) instead you get 0.09999999999999998.As well Assignment 1 handout (HTML) document states:Once you have finished writing the body of hours_difference in IDLE select Run -> Run Module. In the shell test your function by running the examples from the docstring. If the example calls return the expected results move on to Step 4. Otherwise modify your code and repeat the tests.Which means to me that the results should be exactly as explained in the docstring., Unresolved,0
