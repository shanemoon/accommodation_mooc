Wednesday September 18th 2013 11:58 am -04:00,Love how u explain Python that in a way that is easy to understand for beginners  ps it depends on the school as my school only teaches Java C# for their starting language in the course curriculum  ,None,1
Thursday September 19th 2013 1:59 am -04:00,i still believe that Python should be taught as a their the 1st starting language for IT industry students or people who wants to learn on how to program as it much easier to pick up than learning Java or C#.  Its sad that most of my countrys IT schools for diploma level has not considered adding Python into their curriculum  for their introduction to computer programming.Ps: As a person who had learned multiple programming languages i still prefer Python for the ease of learning the language and installation of discipline to aid in learning other programming languages that is sometimes much slack in coding.,None,1
