Friday August 30th 2013 7:27 pm -04:00,To make it an expression you need to send that data to a variable.result = convert_to_celsius(usa_city_temperature(Seattle))You were so close! Hope this helps clarify it a bit.Edit: seems others had the same issue and a return function worked for them instead of having to use a variable. I think the data is there they just wanted you to use it some how., Resolved,2
