Tuesday September 10th 2013 1:02 am -04:00,I am confused as well...reading the instructions it would appear to me that its already written so I am not sure how to go forward.....or what I am missing, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 11:09 pm -04:00,At least you are at the seconds part of it I actually have no idea what I am suppose to do in step 5 at all! I asked but never got a response. I am quite confused and have no idea where to even begin. I am very much a beginner and never even heard of python until I started this course.So here is my questions yet again are we actually suppose to be writing a code for each of the get_whatevers? and if so what exactly am I looking for? I am a visual person reading these instructions has me all topsy turvy.Thanks, Resolved,1
