Friday October 4th 2013 7:50 am -04:00,Hi teaching team - thanks for this great course.Would it be possible to have the testcases used by your scoring software? I cant figure out why I get 4 failures all the test cases I came up with look good.If the actual scoring tests cannot be made public would you mind posting extra tests that we could use to test our code?Thanks a lotBen, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 8:11 am -04:00,update: one of the failure I get is for student: test_a3.Test_08_BoardContainsWord.test_02_word_in_middle_colI have tested this function with many variations and permutations also making some assumption on what in middle col might refer to and I cannot get the function to fail.Any chance you could suggest some test that might help find less obvious errors?Thanksben, Unresolved,0
