Tuesday September 3rd 2013 6:22 pm -04:00,When you right click on a1.py it goes to your Downloads file.  There you will see a1 or a1(1) a1(2) depending on the number of times you right clicked a1.py.  Right click again on any of them (a1 a1(1) a1(2) and it will offer you to Open the file or EDIT witl Python.  Choose the latter.  I hope this helps., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:49 pm -04:00,Harmony did you look for the a1 in your Downloads file? If you do click once on it to see if a box pops up with the option Open and the option EDIT with Python. Choose EDIT... Good luck! , Resolved,0
