Friday September 13th 2013 4:47 am -04:00,Alain I think that is a great idea. I completed assignment 1 and for the life of me couldnt figure out the final two questions. So I could get the clocks to work but they were always an hour behind... not very useful... If I could see somebody elses code it would help me figure out where I went wrong. I know the coordinators dont want us posting code because I have seen warnings against it but as you say it is well after the hard deadline. It is like the quiz in the video lectures when you get your three attempts wrong they dont give the correct answer just what appears to me as some cryptic text that indicates that I have already learnt but miss applied some fundamental understanding.   , Unresolved,0
