Saturday September 14th 2013 10:31 pm -04:00,I copied this code to a file saved and ran it.  It gives this error message. It works fine when I used print(grade1).  So I guess I need to convert grade1 to a str but I cant figure it out.  Why did it work in the video? print(You passed a course with grade: . grade1)AttributeError: str object has no attribute grade1Copied code from lesson: grade1 = 70grade2 = 80if grade1 >= 50:    print(grade1)    print(You passed a course with grade: . grade1)elif grade2 >= 50:    print(You passed a course with grade: . grade2)    , Resolved,0
