But after runningit generates the following messageany problem on my side?.........----------------------------------------------------------------------Ran 9 tests in 0.011sOKTraceback (most recent call last):  File C:/Users/Avneet/Downloads/a1_test.py line 69 in <module>    unittest.main()  File C:\Python33\lib\unittest\main.py line 125 in __init__    self.runTests()  File C:\Python33\lib\unittest\main.py line 267 in runTests    sys.exit(not self.result.wasSuccessful())SystemExit: False, Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 2:10 pm -04:00,Wellthe above comment about changing the last line does the trick. ( unittest.main(exit=False) )Thanks Ive got an OK now. It seems there is some cause for relief since the autograder is down  :), Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 2:33 pm -04:00,Adding the last line helped me get rid of the error I encountered previously. Looks like the Exit function is not specified for the the given code and it cant handle when any exception arises.BTW its my opinionit can be wrong too :) Anyways see it for yourself if it does work., Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 2:34 pm -04:00,On the github pageclick the <> view raw icon and then paste it on new IDLE window.That wayit will eliminate any uncertaion indentation error., Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 1:11 am -04:00,Very simpleyou should have indented the return statement away from the if constructso that only when it would have chacked all possiblitiesthen it would have returned true., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 1:23 am -04:00,I myself was quite surprised when I got 23.0/24.0 and the auto-grader flashed the message is_valid_sequence test failed. I took great pains to ensure empty strings are not accepted but then I realized that in order to humor the auto-graderempty strings must be allowed in the code. Beats mebut removing that check from the code did the trick., Resolved,0
