Saturday September 7th 2013 12:02 pm -04:00,Can anyone tell me wether Im on the right track? I have tried to write a return function for the area_hero function many times now I simply cant understand what Im supossed to do. Based the comments here I thought I could be something like:import triangle.area_hero(sidelength sidelength sidelength)return area_hero(sidelength sidelength sidelength)I have tried other version of the above but think I might be compleatly wrong? , Unresolved,1

Monday September 30th 2013 9:57 am -04:00,Hi George Ive read yours comments and are trying to do as I think you say. My problem is that my function only work if the answers is True.If word is not in the column or row that I get an error instead of FalseI tried a lot of things both with and without writing a for loop fx.  for i in range(len(board[1])):        return board_word_in_column(board word) or board_word_in_row(board word)But only True answers doesnt return an error..Help is much appreciated..        , Unresolved,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 6:04 am -04:00,Thank you for the post. I have a problem with read_words which I just cant fix.my function returns: [CRUNCHY COWS EAT GRASS]Where its only GRASS that gets the newline removed. In my function I have tried to print(newline) after I have rstriped it for /n and there alle words are printet without the newline but when I append it to my list in the next line of code the newline gets added on all words but the last. Any idea of what I do wrong?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 10:52 am -04:00,Hi Ive problems with the board_contains_word function.My problem is that my function only work if the answers is True.If word is not in the column or row than I get an error instead of FalseIn my function make_str_from_row(board row_index) I discovered that the same kind of error emerge if the row_index is larger than the lenght of the board. Can this be the problem? and if so how to solve it? When I hand-in I only get success in the message. So.. I tried a lot of things both with and without writing a for loop in the board_contains_word function but cant find the problem. If I use only this code:        return board_word_in_column(board word) or board_word_in_row(board word)Only True answers doesnt return an error.. How do I make to say False?Help is much appreciated..Method Description:NoneMessage:ERROR: IndexErrorlist index out of range, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 11:21 am -04:00,Yes.. I know that if I use an index witch is higher than the index available in board_contains_word_in_row than it gives me the same message. Ive tried to fix it but I cant make it say False The Message when I hand it in is that all 3 test are succes so Im not sure its where the problem is.., Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 11:38 am -04:00,If I make my make_str_from_row(board row_index) code to an if statement asking it to return False if f row_index >= len(board)Than it returns False if the index is not available but than my board_contains_word_in_row(board word) function makes a new error massage when I want it to say FalseThe Error is:TypeError: argument of type bool is not iterableIt is the same problem with the make_str_from_column, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 11:50 am -04:00,do you mean:for i in len(board[0])  ?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 12:02 pm -04:00,yes but when I remove the len() it gives me the error:    for j in board[i][column_index]:TypeError: list indices must be integers not str, Unresolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 12:22 pm -04:00,I accidentally deleted my former function and cant remember what it was. Ive tried to do as you wrote instead:word =     while column_index in len(board[0]):        word = word + board[   #dont know what to write here#   ][column_index]    return wordBut cant figure out how to make that work either.. My former function worked when it was with in the allowed range but now nothing works. I can see however that a while loop can help since it will only work for the indexs available but Im not sure how to do this.., Unresolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 1:19 pm -04:00,Im sorry for asking again. But no matter what I seem to do my functions always returns an error instead of false. I goes all the way back to make_str_from_row(board row_index) my current code for this functions (as well as the one with make_str_from_col) contains a while loop:   word =     i = 0    while i < len(board[0]):        word = word + board[row_index][i]        i = i + 1    return wordI use these functions all the way up to:board_contains_word(board word):where I have a simple if yyyy or xxxx statement. But If the word is not in the board still an error arrises. Where is my mistake?? my error message:Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#267> line 1 in <module>    board_contains_word([[A N T T] [X S O B]] NO)  File /Users/sannebech/Downloads/a3.py line 134 in board_contains_word    if board_contains_word_in_column(board word) or board_contains_word_in_row(board word):  File /Users/sannebech/Downloads/a3.py line 98 in board_contains_word_in_row    if word in make_str_from_row(board row_index):  File /Users/sannebech/Downloads/a3.py line 52 in make_str_from_row    word = word + board[row_index][i]IndexError: list index out of range>>> , Unresolved,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 10:12 am -04:00,Hi Vadim I realize that I might seem very lasy but Ive used hours on this and of course I tried my functions so I know they do not work.
