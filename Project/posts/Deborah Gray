Sunday August 25th 2013 11:57 pm -04:00,Hi I have python 2.7.2 already loaded  on my Apple OS X 10.8.4.  My systems administrator doesnt want me to download python 3.2. From another post I see that portable python is available for Windows computers only. Can I use Python 2.7 in this course?  Or is there a portable python 3.2 version for Macs? Thanks!,None,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 10:17 am -04:00,Thanks Etienne. Answered all assignment questions as if I was using Python 3. No worries so far. ,None,0

Monday August 26th 2013 10:10 am -04:00,Thanks all. The list of differences appears straightforward. Im doing everything in terminal mode following  the instructor-led videos and will make note of differences as I go along. (I may get out my French lessons as well.),None,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 3:02 am -04:00,Week 1 differencesFor week one the main differences (Python 2.7 vs. Python 3) In Python 2.7:  both the / and // arithmetic operators perform integer division.  For floating point one needs to simply make the numerator or denominator a floating point number to perform the floating point operation (or use float (9) / 2 with parentheses around only one number -- if do float (9 / 2) will perform int division on 9 / 2 first)  Im keeping a list as I go along so I can answer the exercise questions as if I am using Python 3. ,None,1
Thursday August 29th 2013 8:19 am -04:00,Yes Etiennes link is a big help!  Was just trying to help a younger student who doesnt have any programming experience  by explaining the differences as we go through the lectures week by week. I wont do that on the forum if it isnt a help to anyone else.  I can do it offline.  Dont understand what you mean by making it a thing sorry. ,None,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 4:20 am -04:00,Hi Ive checked the other threads and find many similar posts but not an answer that helps.  I should probably give this a rest for a day but it is really bugging me.  Currently I have 21/24 on the assignment.  My errors are in the get_complementary module.  When I run this module  on the Python visualizer and wakari.io in Python 3.3 everything works as expected -- even for a zero-length sequence handout example and a sequence with multiple occurrences of each nucleotide .  Yet the following errors are returned when I submit my assignment. What am I not seeing? What is an attribute error?Errors listed:  1)test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_empty  Method Description:Have you tested your function on a zero-length sequence?Message:ERROR: AttributeError   ReplacerModule object has no attribute get_complementary_sequence2) test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_handout_exampleMethod Description:  Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?Message:  ERROR: AttributeError  ReplacerModule object has no attribute get_complementary_sequence3) test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_long  Method Description:  Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences of each nucleotide?Message:  ERROR: AttributeError  ReplacerModule object has no attribute get_complementary_sequence, Resolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 5:36 am -04:00,Thanks for getting back to me so quickly Kundula and Anonymous! All is now okay with no errors. I had submitted the code written for get_complementary_sequence under get_complement by mistake.  Shouldve just taken a break and come back to it but wanted to finish before the weekend.  Yahoo!, Resolved,0
