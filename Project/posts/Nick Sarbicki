Thursday August 22nd 2013 6:22 am -04:00,Im 22 and got interested in programming over the last 6 months or so.Ive spent a bit of time playing around with Codecademy and completed their HTML/CSS Javascript and JQuery courses. I mainly feel like Im just scratching the surface so I thought Id join a more official course and learn a language which I can apply to my life. Im going to run through this course whilst doing the Codecademy track as well from what I can see there is a bit of overlap so Im treating it like homework!,None,1

Wednesday August 28th 2013 3:40 am -04:00,There are a lot of languages out there and no direct progression from one to another so its really up to you.In terms of apps ios and android have their own languages so it would be worth learning one of those if you want to learn to make apps.

Sunday August 25th 2013 4:30 pm -04:00,Gerry I was thinking about taking that course after I finish this one.It looks like a really good way to consolidate whatever I learn here.,None,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 3:34 pm -04:00,Im here because I think its really important to become tech literate in this current age which to me means understanding how certain machines and programmes are built and then being able to build them yourself.Im planning on using this course to discover the basics of programming so that I can start creating apps (using java/android) and other hardware setups (e.g. with the raspberry pi) which are tailored towards my life. It will also help me in my current job as a scientist. And if Im lucky I might even make a career out of it!,None,1
Tuesday September 10th 2013 5:20 am -04:00,Yes Maybe No?Lots of questions and the answer is often the same: it really depends on what you want to do. Which youve eluded to.For me I work in a science lab and MatLab is used everyday which requires its own coding language. I havent used it myself yet and everyone Ive talked to praise it as a magical power. What Ive found is that in around 200 people one person can code it effectively. So I thought Id learn how coding works.I started with the codecademy tracks (HTML CSS JavaScript) having absolutely no idea what I was doing. It was fun and I learnt a lot especially with JavaScript but I realised I dont really want to do much WebDev. So Ive settled for trying to do things which are functional (make personalised apps create hardware designed for my life with Raspberry Pi). Looking around at what I need for these aims Ive found Java and Python. Python is the primary language used for Raspberry Pi and is a recommended beginner language as it is simple and easy to learn. Its also supposed to be similar to Java and C so should be a good starting point to learn other more advanced languages.Java is next because it is the primary basis for making Android apps.Essentially my scaffold is/was: Start learning so I can get a grasp of what the hell Im getting myself into.Figure out what the hell I want to do.Research to find out whats needed/fits my wants.Start with the easiest language and do a few courses.Practice with first language build a few things if possible (Im already planning a game).Start more advanced language.Build with advanced language.???Profit.For specific constellations of programming languages? Im not entirely sure of all of them but I have a hazy idea of a few.Web Dev: HTML and CSS are essential. Then JavaScript and PHP.Gaming production: Varies for what youre designing it for. Web games: JavaScript will do.Computer games/Video games: Really varies but Java and C++ are probably a good start maybe C.Computer software/programmes: For Microsoft use C# Apple uses objective-C. Not sure about Linux.Apps: Andoird uses Java. ios uses objective-cAnalysis(Financial Science Marketing etc.): This gets really complicated. MatLab is the general language used for Scientific research that I know of. Although I know a few computer science labs use R to design analytical software. For finance and marketing which requires analysis of large databases a lot of people tend to use SQL (or MySQL - Oracles version of SQL). Realistically MatLab could probably do a lot of this stuff but it is used on expensive and specialist software MySQL is fairly accessible and there are open-source versions of it.Another language worth a shout is Scratch. Its a new language designed in MIT for educational purposes. Its extremely basic and very visual which makes it ideal for teaching kids how to programme. But although it looks much more basic then anything we learn here it is still capable of designing things like games and so on.I have no idea what is best for code-breaking. But as cryptography is heavily based on mathematics and algorithms I reckon it will be more about how good your maths is as opposed to which languages you know.Nevertheless do some research yourself and when it comes to solving a problem and which specific language to use youll probably know once youve learnt a couple!,None,3
Sunday August 25th 2013 4:37 pm -04:00,Although Im not a staff member I think it should be OK.The honour code seems to be more of a give your word type of thing as opposed to a sealed digital contract which tracks what you are doing. For example it would be pretty easy for you to take the homework and then just Google the questions if you wanted. It goes against the spirit of the course in that you wont necessarily be learning anything but it would be more or less impossible to track (without illegal breaches of your privacy).Im pretty sure you can use the same computer. The point is to really just not look at each others work and try to complete assignments yourself. Aside from that its probably advisable to study with each other and discuss mistakes you make it would make a better learning experience for you both if you encouraged and supported each other.

Tuesday August 27th 2013 11:37 am -04:00,The trick which Im not sure was put across very clearly in the videos is that you can call a function inside the parameters of another function. Essentially making the argument for one function from the product of another function.I dont think I could say anymore without seriously giving the answer away.Edit: Im a fool Im talking about question 15.14 is really simple if you think about it. You dont need to come up with any new functions or find an already existent function from Pythons database. Just think about the mathematics of a vowels and consonants to words., Unresolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:39 pm -04:00,Anon is right one of your attempts is correct aside from your parameters.Remember you are writing out the body of a function so there are a couple things you cant do. One is to enter an argument. You do that when you call the function. Instead when defining a function you replace an argument with an arbitrary value (such as word - notice the lack of quotation marks) to represent its parameters.Secondly you cant name the function in its own body unless as a comment.if we are defining the function num_mountains then our body cant be:    return num_mountains(mountains1(num) + mountains2(num))This is because num_mountains isnt yet defined (because we are currently defining it) so will create an error. mountains1(num) and mountains2(num) we assume were created previously before we defined this function.This particular exercise is nothing to do with defining the number of letters in hello its about defining a function that could tell you the number of letters in any word (hello included)From experience I also have to tell you that one of the most frustrating problems in getting your code wrongs can be small spelling mistakes or switched words. They are simple issues which by and large dont mean you misunderstood just that you made a small mistake., Unresolved,7
Wednesday August 28th 2013 6:05 pm -04:00,Because it is not an inbuilt function. Its a made up function for the purposes of this exercise. To run it in IDLE you would have to first create the function., Unresolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 9:31 am -04:00,It matters in a sense because of how computer memory works and the order in which it executes commands.You are right in thinking that the computer could attempt to change x=1 (where 1 is stored at id1) to x=2 (where 2 is stored at id2) whilst keeping the same memory address and just overwriting the data. However this creates a couple problems. Namely the computer doesnt know how big a piece of data it is going to store and this may not match up to the size of the previous data in some way.As a result Python keeps things running safely by always assigning a new memory address to all pieces of data so as to stop any errors occuring in its own memory.By doing this id1 does become defunct for a fraction of a second. However the garbage collector regularly sweeps through the memory addresses and gets rid of any useless data which isnt attached to any variables/sections of code. So even though id1 is made momentarily useless it will be available again as soon as the next command is executed.Realistically if you kept changing x from 1 to 2 to 3 etc. you wouldnt go from id1 to id2 to id 3 etc. you would just cycle back and forth between id1 and id2 as each is cleared after they become useless.This is based off of my rudimentary knowledge so anyone is welcome to come and correct me if I got something wrong!, Unresolved,4
Saturday August 31st 2013 6:22 pm -04:00,As far as I understand y wouldnt refer to the phrase x+2 it just refers to the product of the sum. Im not sure about this though., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 3:32 am -04:00,My knowledge is only limited when it comes to memory addresses. But in that example there are two possibilities Im not sure which is correct.In one possibility x = 1 assumes id1 not because 1 was in id1 before but because when you changed x to 7 id1 was cleared and made available again.In te other possibility x will relate to id4. This is because although you have changed x y still relates to the original value and therefore the original memory address so id1 is still being used.In my opinion the first option is more likely. I think but Im not sure that y wouldnt relate to the original x + 2 but instead will just relate to the product of the calculation (3). So id2 will = 3 not x+2. If this is the case then changing x will certainly make id1 redundant.Its probably better if someone more knowledgeable confirmed though before you trust me!, Unresolved,0

Wednesday August 28th 2013 9:32 am -04:00,I havent put in any floats as a calculation (Im only using the examples) but as long as theres no decimal then it returns as an int and not a float (e.g. 5 as opposed to 5.0).I submitted my code again and it passed 41/41 but it still bugs me a bit..., Resolved,0

Saturday August 31st 2013 4:52 am -04:00,To simplify the above.Memory addresses are only limited by the amount of memory your computer has. (Im not very knowledgeable about hardware but I assume were talking RAM memory and not hard drive memory.). However the amount of memory addresses your computer can hold is probably far more than youll ever need.That said memory addresses can be reused assuming that they have no function. For example lets assume youve assigned a value of 12 to variable number (number = 12). This means that number is now connected to memory address x1 which holds the value 12. Now lets change the value of number to 30 (number = 30). Now number is connected to the memory address x2 which holds the value 30.By doing this x1 has become useless as it isnt connected to any variable. The garbage collector (a specialist part of Python) regularly scans through the memory addresses looking for ones which have become useless like x1 and clears them. So almost immediately after the value of number is changed x1 becomes useless and is cleared by the garbage collector. As a result of x1 being cleared it becomes available for use again and you can assign it a new value.This is just a nifty way for Python to decrease errors in memory storage when you may have overlapping memory addresses which are to big or small for their relative stacks of data., Unresolved,4
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:12 am -04:00,So Im questioning the ability to hide the passwords.You want to hide them in a random string of letters? Ok. So how is that going to work?Are you asking it to pull out specific letters from specific strings to form your password? Or is there a specific string within a string which is your password or answer?You will in the end have to create if statements which define what the answers are (if xxxx then give password etc.). and more to the point the code will have to have a way of producing the actual password (password = x from sting 1 + y from string b etc.)Maybe Im missing the point here but will it work?Alternatives I can think is giving the file a random name which you remember (flrblwswartz or something) and encrypting the folder which it is in. Then instead of opening the file directly you could run it as a module in Python. As you know the name you can always get access. Then you continue with your other levels of security.A good encryption will be impossible to break and will stop anyone from seeing your code. From then on the only way someone can use your code is if they a: know the name of the module b: understand how the functions work. and c: know the answers to your questions.The only other possibility is to use a bit of cryptography and instead of producing your password produce a formulaic product of your password (a simple version would be to produce every letter +2 of its value e.g. instead of a produce c or instead of f produce h. You can make it far more complicated though.).Nevertheless good luck!,None,0

Sunday September 15th 2013 2:58 am -04:00,Tom is right.Remember back in exercise 1 where we were asked to put a function inside the parameters of a function? You can do that and to make this a one line code you should do that.At the same time if you start from the exact same point as the original occurrence you are going to find that original occurrence (remember how indexing works. We start on the first number and finish on the one before second number). This is where you have to use an arithmetic operator., Resolved,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 3:03 pm -04:00,Ive had so much trouble opening files for reading and using them.

Then I read the file and assign the read file into a variable (past this point if I read the file any further I will just get  so it would be worth using file.close() to close the file to be reopened later.The rest of the code runs through the newest variable line by line transferring each line into a list which is then appended to another list.

Tuesday October 1st 2013 3:04 pm -04:00,I should add that its not recommended to create a parsing code (like the one above) for .csv files as they have a builtin module already. I have since rewritten most of my code for .csv files but this should work for anything thats .txt., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 4:53 pm -04:00,Gah this is mildly frustrating.Im making a code to convert postcodes (UK version of the ZIP code) to longitude/latitude co-ordinates. I have a tonne of CSV files which use both so I want to normalise them so I can continue work on a bigger project. I figured with what weve learnt recently Im finally ready to give it a go.So Im stuck right at the beginning where Im converting my file into a Python friendly list. Here is the code:from tkinter.filedialog import askopenfile# Create a variable for the filefile = askopenfile()#create some empty variablesdoc = dox = data = #read through the file line by line to make it a manageable listfor line in file:    # clean any required variables for each loop    data =     dox =     for i in line:        #grab individual characters and combine/separate into actual data        #according to the separator: in a .csv file this would be the comma.	if i != :            data = data+i	else:            #append comma for completeness            data = data+i            #append piece of data to inner list            dox.append(data)            #clean required variable            data =     #append inner list to outer list    doc.append(dox)The type of input it should give is the following:[[{AACDC187-2E3E-4705-BCF3-0001C4187ADD}][208000][28/06/2013 00:00][AL2 3HX][F][N][L][17][TENNYSON ROAD][ST ALBANS][ST ALBANS][HERTFORDSHIRE][A] [rest of list]]instead what I get is that almost every item of the inner list is the entire set of data instead of a single line.I tested this by comparing each of the inner lists to each other sequentially :>>> for line in range(len(doc)):	print(doc[line] == doc[line+1])The first half came up True the other half Falsealthough comparison by eye shows little difference.Im so confused as to why this is happening. can anyone help?,None,0

Sunday September 29th 2013 5:06 pm -04:00,Did it! Sorry for the waste of a post I switched over to a readlines approach automatically creating a large list and then separating out the values into inner lists which worked!Still not sure why the above failed so if anyone can explain that would be great!Here is the finished part of my code:from tkinter.filedialog import askopenfile# Create a variable for the filefile = askopenfile()#create some empty variablesdoc = dox = data = #turn the lines into a listlines = file.readlines()#read through the list item by item to create inner listsfor line in lines:    # clean any required variables for each loop    data =     dox =     for i in line:        #grab individual characters and combine/separate into actual data        #according to the separator: in a .csv file this would be the comma.        if i != :            data = data+i        else:            #append comma for completeness            data = data+i            #append piece of data to inner list            dox.append(data)            #clean required variable            data =     #append inner list to outer list    doc.append(dox),None,2

Tuesday October 1st 2013 2:44 pm -04:00,Its possible!Although the guys over at stackoverflow told me I was screwing around too much by making my own parsing code (the one above) which would run through a CSV file and create a python list. Instead I should use the much more efficient and specially designed csv.reader() function which I am now doing.Ive come on a bit since this problem although Im taking a break at the moment. My code is complete in theory but doesnt work because the amount of data I want to process is simply too much for a list (my code has to do over a trillion calculations which crashes IDLE). So Im going to try rewrite the code to read and write each individual line to a file simultaneously so python never has to keep too much data open and to change everything into dictionary format so I dont have to iterate over every single inner list when running my conversion programme.,None,1

Tuesday October 1st 2013 5:44 am -04:00,Can you explain this further?Im writing a programme which initially used lists to do close to a trillion calculations which evidently crashed my computer. I was told dictionaries might be able to handle this. But considering that the sorting is arbitrary Im very curious as to how it is better suited to the task., Unresolved,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 3:40 pm -04:00,You dont need to open anything in your code. That is done for you in the driver file which is supplementary to what the a3.py file.What you essentially need to do is create a programme which reads (iterates loops however you want to read a file in python)  and creates a new list which contains either the board or the words.Check out the docstring which tells you what is going in and coming out. Note how both state (file open for reading) -> List of xxxxxx.That is because the file is already open for reading. You just need to convert the open file into the given format., Unresolved,1
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 4:53 am -04:00,That looks pretty cool! Ive done some HTML and CSS but could never come up with something as smooth looking as that. Very nice and clean.So Im a noob when it comes to web dev but Im interested in making some sites at some point. What did you use to host your site? And do you have any specific future plans?,None,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 5:49 am -04:00,Thanks Alain and Dip!Do you know if its possible to self-host for example obtaining a static IP address and loading your web page onto a Raspberyy Pi?,None,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:01 am -04:00,Its a thought Ive been having recently. I doubt it would ever be cost effecitive but if you wanted complete control over your projects i.e. creation hosting maintenance. More or less everything. You could theoretically plug in a second phone line make a contract with a second ISP which allows hosting then run your websites through a raspberry pi connected to a hard drive depending on how much space you require. Or you could build your own dedicated computer for the purpose of hosting.,None,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:22 am -04:00,I figured there will be some ability to prioritise upload speeds over download speeds with an ISP that allows hosting and fiber would have to be used.Power outages would be a problem although I could setup a backup system to make sure information isnt lost.Maintenance wise if I have a backup of the projects I could rework and change that backup while still hosting in the standard way. That way if I ever need to make changes I could write and test everything with a different machine and then upload the new version in as minimal a time as possible. Im not planning anything facebook sized and most people can understand if a site has a bit of downtime now and again.,None,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 4:51 am -04:00,Im not too sure what youre asking but if youre asking whether when you open the programme that every possible variable is assigned to 0 then I believe that is not true.Instead there simply are no variables. you have to create one before it is assigned anything otherwise you would have an infinite list of variables relating to 0 which your computer or any computer for that matter wouldnt be able to deal with., Unresolved,0
