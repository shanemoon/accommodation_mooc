Sunday September 22nd 2013 11:45 am -04:00,Hello I submitted the assignment the first time and got 20/24. Then I realized Id named get_complementary_sequence as get_complementary_strand and I resubmitted for 23/24. However with my last failure as far as I can tell test_is_valid_sequence_lowercase is intended to see if the function is_valid_sequence accepts lowercase letters. And as you can see from this screenshot and my code my function does so. Is there some reason Im not getting points for this?, Unresolved,0
