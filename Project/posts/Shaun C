Friday September 13th 2013 5:48 am -04:00,Cocktail party? When and where? :-)On a serious note OP if youre asking questions about the stack (and associated terms like heap frame push and pop) youre well on your way to becoming a coder. I understand them when theyre explained to me but I couldnt explain them to anyone else.(OK after seeing the lecture again heres my current understandingA stack contains frames and frames are dynamically created and destroyed as a program executeshttps://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/lecture/44)(and having seen it again I can addFrames inform the heap which is where the program gets its output from)Thanks for asking OP learned lots myself!, Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 8:24 am -04:00,I share your fear that Ill futilely digress into irrelevant areas if I think too much about it (I like black boxes that I dont have to worry about).I believe the visualizer is an aid to understand something that should be in our heads when we think of a program executing.In practice I only use the visualizer when Im stuck.It uses the concept of stack frames.Outside the visualizer I dont even think about stack frames :-), Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 9:08 am -04:00,I dont believe experienced programmers use it either but I stand to be corrected maybe they do.Im only starting to understand the debuggerhttps://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/lecture/56Im at the limit of what I know I think someone more knowledgeable should chip in.In particular how do you see the line numbers the debugger refers to in the .py file?The lecturer doesnt have them turned on.Is it useful to see them?, Resolved,0

Friday October 4th 2013 1:33 pm -04:00,The archived lectures from last time are available. I might look at them next week before 6001x starts. But I need a break from coding for a few days :-), Resolved,0
