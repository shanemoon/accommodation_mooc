Monday August 26th 2013 5:13 am -04:00,Hi everybody this discussions are really helpful. I was just wondering: is it ord the only function that requires quotes? And what do quotes mean in Python?, Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 11:53 am -04:00,Thank you everybody for this discussion. I thought I had a problem :) but it was simply looking for a complicated answer when there was a very simple one. It is indeed asking for the simple result of a division. Now I know why my IT friends talk in short concrete sentences :),None,0
Monday August 26th 2013 5:18 am -04:00,Hi Scott I went back to the video at the quiz you are mentioning and the correct answer for how many arguments round take is actually 2. Please check back on the video. , Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 12:58 pm -04:00,Hello everybody not sure whether this group is active but I would like to join it as I am in London.Would welcome the opportunity to review the weeks as of week 3 in preparation for the final exam. I kind of lost the plot as of week 3 and been surviving the exercises and assignments ever since. I would like to understand rather than just run the IDLE and see what comes out :)Not sure how to do this but look forward to meeting you and if you have the same need find a way to study together for the final exam. ,None,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 4:52 am -04:00,Thank you for replying. Here is what I would like to do / need help with: I am planning to go through the weekly Exercises and the Assignments again all through this last week. I will start at Week 3 as I think the first two weeks were easy. I can pick only those Questions where I filled in the correct answer without really understanding why -- in other words they worked because IDLE worked them out correctly but I am not sure I know why. I can post them here and maybe we can work out a plain English explanation of them. How does that sound? ,None,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 7:07 pm -04:00,Will do so thanks for the reminder so will stop before week 6. At the moment I am plodding through week 6 and 7 to finish off the course before I start the review so I will most likely ask the questions over the weekend. ,None,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 1:06 pm -04:00,Here is what worked for me in IDLE and returned the right answer:>>> Seattle=45>>> usa_city_temperature(convert_to_celsius(Seattle))I had the following definition for usa_city_temperature when I ran the module:def usa_city_temperature(word):    (word) -> numberReturns temperature in Fahrenheit forthe respective word which represents an American city.    Atlanta=30    return (Atlanta-32)*5/9Of course I would love to hear anybodys feedback on whether I did it right., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 12:15 pm -04:00,Thank you very much to the instructors and all colleagues for this course and for being so responsive.I know you mentioned that the count-vowels Body will be discussed in a later week as it (could be) a bit too complex but I am dying to hear if anyone has any idea of what it could look like.I am thinking:return IF(aeiou) = numberdoes this make sense? Just checking that I am on the right track and this is an IF body.Thank you, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 6:31 am -04:00,Hi George thank you for the explanation - I was thinking about the answer in a more simple fashion: if the operator is OR that means at least one...But I was also thinking what if the expression would have been: math_grade < 50 OR bio_grade >= 50 AND cs_grade >= 50 - what would have been a correct statement?, Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 1:56 pm -04:00,I had the same issue because I was trying to go ahead of the video and do my statements and had no idea about elif: and else:I am guessing the tutors used this lecture to introduce all three in one block but the if: was necessary and sufficient with the report_status example. Or am I wrong?, Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 6:56 am -04:00,Ondrej could you please re-check the correct answer in that quiz? I think it is without quotes which is what you got so you were right.It is not in quotes because the function applied is PRINT. You get the quotes if the function applied is STR. >>> print (4)4>>> str (4)4Try by yourself in IDLE and you will see. , Unresolved,0

Sunday September 15th 2013 11:46 am -04:00,Brilliant examples thank you now it makes sense! it is not just convention it is how we slice numbers indeed (I use it in finance for cash flow projections to slice weeks but I did not put the two together :)). You should be tutors! , Resolved,0

Friday September 13th 2013 3:00 am -04:00,Good question Barry - but I dont have an answer as I am not knowledgeable. I will also add another question to yours: at the beginning of the computers I used to have a function in my desktop computer called defragmenting that was supposed to fix what was stored in the memory of the computer over time and eliminate gaps to make the computer run faster/smoothly. Not sure whether this is done manually any more as it seems that the software updates are automatically taking care of the reorganisation of memory (or am I wrong and believe in magic?). Did the defragmenting referred to stacks as per this lessons? Was it something about making the stacks and functions more orderly? Thank you for help. , Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 5:14 am -04:00,Thank you Alain let me see whether I understand: stacks are created by the software memory. Software has memory and is organised in stacks.Hard drives do not have memory but inscriptions that are organised as fragments or something like that (not really important what is important for me  to clarify is that the notion of memory applies to software not hardware). , Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 4:05 am -04:00,Thank you very much Alain for all the details and explanation. it seems that I have taken the tutors metaphors of stacks and frames a bit too literally :) And there is another level of abstraction that I need to jump in order to understand software is just lines of code that are stored on your hard drive but I will get there. Thanks again., Resolved,0

Sunday September 15th 2013 11:08 am -04:00,Hello everybodythis morning I had nothing better to do so I played around with the in function ...>>> w in wordTrue>>> w and o in wordTrue>>> w or o in wordwHow can you explain that last result? Any idea?And thank you everybody for that ASCII reference to the comparison using the order of letters I thought I was a victim of abracadabra when I saw that result first :), Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 4:08 pm -04:00, makes sense thank you so it is the order of the operations to return boolean expressions. , Resolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:36 pm -04:00,Good idea Benjamin thank you - to get to 100 I had to take out the total=0 and put it at the beginning so the it keeps track of total at the beginning not all through:def mystery(lst):    total = 0    for sublist in lst:        for num in sublist:            total = total + num                return total>>> print(mystery([[10 20] [20] [40 10]]))100But I dont get how Python knows that sublist refers to what we need it to do i.e. look into the sublists. Am I missing something?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:50 pm -04:00,I have a similar problem. I asked the question in another thread: all of a sudden Python miraculously knows that sublist is a sublist. Just like in the above example with mark without being predefined in the function. The same with the exercise at the end of the video when all of a sudden Python starts printing spam! although it is not predefined anywhere. What am I missing? for i in outer:    for j in inner:        print(spam! end= ), Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:52 pm -04:00,oops can I answer and therefore cancel the last part of my own question? It prints spam! because the command is print (spam!). I was taken aback by the second part of print which is confusing., Unresolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 4:36 pm -04:00,Guys I just simply ran it in IDLE after of course saving and running the module shift_left as built by tutor during the video lecture.I got the following:>>> sev = [7]>>> shift_left(sev)>>> sev[7], Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 7:01 pm -04:00,I dont know it worked for me. And I opened the explanation box and it was confirmed in there as well. , Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:57 pm -04:00,If the length of list inner is 5 and the length of list outer is 7 how many times will this code print spam!? (That is how many times will the body of the inner loop be executed?)for i in outer:    for j in inner:        print(spam! end= )I didfor i in range (17):         for j in range (15):               print (spam! end= )and it printed spam! 24 times. But the correct answer is 35 and I get the math but what am I doing wrong in my code?, Unresolved,0
