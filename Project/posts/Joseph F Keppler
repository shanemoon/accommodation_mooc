Sunday September 1st 2013 7:43 pm -04:00,Why is there such a cat-and-mouse game being played here in question 14 and 15? Nothing seems to work for Q 14 and 15 except for those who know the syntax and thus the correct answer. This is making me feel like a foreigner who is being teased for not knowing how to talk right. Nobody says how to get it right exactly. They just hint. And so this is an introduction to programming?Yo whats up with dat?, Unresolved Locked,-8

So we just keep hinting how to pronounce a foreign word without ever saying it and the student will surely learn the correct pronunciation eventually. Good luck with that approach.These two questions are examples of bad pedagogy; they would have created a better learning experience if they had been in a multiple-choice format as other questions in the exercise are., Unresolved Locked,-14

Surely to question how the material is presented when everybody is so willing to share their hints for the correct answers is churlish of me. To learn by struggling long and hard with guesswork is a good thing I suppose. Correctional facilities are like that when the guards and the warden give you hope that you only have to keep putting in your time and then you will eventually be wise like them.Time is good. Learning is good. This is my last post here for I do not want to upset anyone or solicit helpful enthusiasm or hints. It seems I am learning as much about anthropology as programming here. Nevertheless I will continue putting in my time to learn correct fundamental programming the hard knocks way., Unresolved Locked,-1
