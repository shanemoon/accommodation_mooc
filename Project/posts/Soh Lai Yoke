Tuesday August 20th 2013 3:49 am -04:00,Hi I need help as I have a problem with the installation of Python 3.3.2 in my Windows XP. I downloaded the installer package however after I click to start installation a window pop up stating preparing to install for just a few seconds then the whole thing disappear. Is this problem due to incompatibility? Or do I need to get an older version as Im using Windows XP SP3?, Resolved,0
