Saturday September 7th 2013 11:04 am -04:00,I had the same problem. I hope I can help by going backwards. Note that my explanations below should bring a very very short return for each function.  Dont try to mix functions. It is just simple calculations. Pay attention to the bold one. That is where the problem was. Now imagine your digital clock is now  showing 02:32:17 and you want to calculate the total seconds: 2 hours * 3600 seconds=720032 minutes * 60 seconds= 1920now you sum the 7200+1920+17=9137 secondsNow try to go back and build your digital clock again:How many hours in 9137 seconds?  You will divide by 3600 seconds in one hour. Note that the division will have to be integer for the clock to give you 2. You want complete hours. Additionally: A day has 86400 seconds. If instead of 9137 seconds it would have been 450000 seconds we would been given 125 hours. A day has 24 hours so you need to take the days out because the clock starts new again when hitting 24. Therefore you only want the hours left after having completed the days what is call the residual. There is a hint on how to do that on the to_24_hour_clock function. See careful and realize that the difference is that one is in hours and the other is in seconds.  In total there are only two calculations in this return. Now the same thing for minutes. This time you will divide by 60 seconds in a minute and get an integer number: 154. The problem here is: that the clock starts counting again at the 60 minutes. Same as before you will have to find the residual. This time instead of using the 24 you will have to use the amount of minutes in one hour. Same procedure as with the get_hours. In total there are only two calculations in this return. There is no conversion from seconds to seconds but you still need to calculate the residual of seconds. In total there is only one calculation in this return. I hope it helps. Adding below the operators so you can follow the process.

Saturday September 7th 2013 3:45 pm -04:00,dont give up. How many errors are you getting? When you click on failure It tells you how many errors in get_hours how many errors in get_minutes...Can you tell me where you have the errors?, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 3:47 pm -04:00,Also dont give up. Week 3 is easier. I think the problem here was the logic of the exercise not the programming. , Unresolved,1
Saturday September 7th 2013 3:48 pm -04:00,You are allowed to post mistakes. I think. So post the returns and I will give you hints without giving you the answer, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 5:04 pm -04:00,type your returns so I can see where you are making the mistakes and guide you, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 3:40 am -04:00,The Get_Seconds I think it is correct so I would edit your comment and delete that part so you dont get into trouble.  If you get an error on this one might be a syntax error. Make sure you use the three  to close the description before using the return. Check that the return is indented. @José: For the 452000 gives me 20 second with the formula.Not sure what you saw wrong there. Please share :)You need to follow the same idea for the rest.  With your formula in get_hours you only converted the seconds to hours. Now you got the number of hours but if you get more than 24 hours then you cannot use your digital clock. You still need to find the back to_24_clock_ hour. Can you see now what other calculation is missing. With the minutes do the same procedure that with the hours. Convert seconds to minutes and then find the residual. , Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:41 am -04:00,You get the failure because the formula does not contemplate large amounts of seconds. Basically if the amount of seconds is higher than the amount of seconds one day has (86400) then you get more hours than 24 hours. Therefore you need an extra calculation or call the To_24_hours function to fix this. , Unresolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 1:52 pm -04:00,yes I had the same problem. The file should not be open in the module. Instead in the Idle. , Unresolved,1
