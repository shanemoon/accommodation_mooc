Tuesday August 20th 2013 6:38 am -04:00,I was going to post it yesterday I thought it would be a great idea if we try to post here our attemps but when I began summing up I realize I don´t know how to use mathematical expressions like how to do the average with the highest numbers among a group of numbers ( I tried with max built-in function but I got stuck xD). I should start with something easier.,None,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 7:28 am -04:00,It´s a part from an exercise I saw in my degree (Biology) it´s quite complex to write it in Python. But the main idea is if we have several numbers (like a b c d e integer numbers) describe a function which compares them take the highest numbersand do the average. This is what I tried.>>> def average (a b c d):       return ( max (a b c d) + I don´t know how to continue ) / 2I´m using a b c d e because I don´t know a priori which number is the highest so the computer has to do it for me I saw you can write if and not but how to use this commands? xD This was the reason why I said I should start with somethingeasier.-------Shall we try to calculate the area of an hexagon? We can do it in a shorter way or in a larger way and might be interesting.-------Perimetrer rectangle:>>> def perimetrer (a b):return a + b>>> a= 4>>> b= 5>>> result = perimetrer (a b)>>> result9,None,0

Wednesday August 21st 2013 7:58 pm -04:00,I was wondering how to write  Pitagora´s theorem on Python because it doesn´t allow me to write:def hypotenuse ** 2 (cathetus1 cathetus2):         return cathetus1 ** 2 + cathetus2 ** 2or def hypotenuse (cathetus1 cathetus2):         return hypotenuse **2 : (I tried using other symbols like ; but it still didn´t allow me) cathetus1 ** 2 + cathetus2 ** 2but it let me to write this:def hypotenuse  (cathetus1 cathetus2):         return (cathetus1 ** 2 + cathetus2 ** 2) ** (1/2)And how to write this ones? xy = whatever also you can´t use : or ; because it displays errorPS: how do you do to write inside the chart? It´s fancy xD,None,0

Saturday August 24th 2013 6:56 am -04:00,Excuse me I read in Course Logistics that there are 7 weekly excercises but I only have found one. Am I wrong? I don´t want to fail this course. I first download the videos in order to see them offline due to I haven´t a properly internet connection right now. Where can I do the video quiz and submit the answers?,None,0
