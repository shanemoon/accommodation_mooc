Saturday October 5th 2013 10:24 am -04:00,I assume that you are doing something like this:file = /Applications/Python 3.3/file.txtopen(file r)This opens the file but you havent assigned the file to a variable so Python just tells you that the file is now open (thats what the line you quoted means).  You need to assign the open file to a variable like this:file = /Applications/Python 3.3/file.txtopen_file = open(file r)then you can do things like open_file.readline() etc.Hope that helps!,None,1
