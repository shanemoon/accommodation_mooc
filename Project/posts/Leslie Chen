Tuesday September 10th 2013 2:09 pm -04:00,I would like the answers especially if I could not figure out the solution.  I also would like to see different ways to code the same thing to compare how I did and allow me to learn how to write more elegant code.  Perhaps the administrators of the course want to limit the breaking of the honor code by future students by not providing the answers.,None,0
Monday September 9th 2013 4:49 pm -04:00,I tried to follow along with Professor Campbell and typed the code in IDLE.  When I run the code my script doesnt seem to move forward (or doesnt loop).  The return value for num_vowels is always 0 and the return value for vowels is always an empty string  .  I have checked several times to make sure the code is exactly as Professor Campbell had.  Perhaps I am blind.  Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong?  Thank you.def count_vowels(s):    (str) -> int    >>> count_vowels(dog)    1    >>> count_vowels(pattycake)    3            num_vowels = 0    for char in s:        if char in aeiouAEIOU:            num_vowels = num_vowels + 1        return num_vowelsdef collect_vowels(s):     (str) -> str    Return the vowels from s.  Do not treat the letter y as a vowel.    >>> collect_vowels(Happy Anniversary)    aAiea    >>> collect_vowels(xyz)            vowels =     for char in s:        if char in aeiouAEIOU:            vowels = vowels + char        return vowels, Resolved,0
