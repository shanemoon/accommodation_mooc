Sunday August 25th 2013 9:54 pm -04:00,I come from the development of software for pharma companies which use to develop drugs run simulations. Most of the computation scientist feel python as an easy to learn programming language and quick to devleop scripts interacting with C/C++ core functionalities using swig for example.,None,0

Monday August 26th 2013 12:04 am -04:00,In the lecture of Defining Functions it was mentioned to write the function definitions in a .py file and run the module to restart the shell. What happen internally is the path to .py file get added to sys.path and the .py file get imported in locals() namespace ( from area import * for example ) and the functions in area.py can be called by its name without the module name. To see for yourself the list of things brought into locals namespace type locals() in IDLE and see for yourself., Resolved,1

Saturday September 14th 2013 10:28 pm -04:00,In the lecture it was mentioned to go through each character in given string with each character in vowel set to see if it match. Two questions that come to my mind - 1) Would it not be better to introduce a break statement once we find a match and increment num_vowels to continue iterating the characters from given string?2) Does python convert the second loop to a concept like jump table to speed of iteration? This is O(n^2) complexity (quadratic) and will it not be better to have a dict to reduce to O(n)?-Karthik, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 12:01 am -04:00,It would have been better if assignment submission has a time tracking to inform user when it is valid for next submission. Right now if we want to submit before the deadline to fix up errors to get full grade we have to wait 1 hour between each submission. Unless you click submit and upload the code it doesnt tell you how long to wait. It could have been made simpler at the assignment page. Please consider this proposal for next course.,None,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 2:13 pm -04:00,HiIt would have been bettter if we start the for loop with range(10) so we could print 0-9 inside the loop rather than dealing it as a separate piece of code.-Karthik, Unresolved,0
