Monday August 26th 2013 4:31 am -04:00,So when a new expression is written the new value is allocated to a new memory address. Does the old value get removed or does it stay in its memory address. eg. a = 5     memory address x6                                  b = 3                                 x10                                  a = 20                                x8What happens to the value 5 in memory address x6?, Resolved,0
