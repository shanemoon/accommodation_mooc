Friday September 13th 2013 7:53 am -04:00,Wouldnt it be easier to check to see if the character from dna is in the allowed values (i.e. ATCG) if its not then we found a bad sequence.  My code used one return statement in the for loop and one outside the loop and it seems to work OK.Also you probably dont need the isupper predicate function because...>>> A in ABCTrue>>> a in ABCfalseHope this helps a bit.RegardsBrad, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 3:06 pm -04:00,Id like to go back and redo my first assignment (now that I have a bit more experience with Pythonetc) and Id like to be able to get automated feedback just like when we submit before the due date i.e. the results of the unit tests.Im not looking to get credit but just to use as a tool for my own piece of mind.  This functionality might also be of some benefit to those students just joining the course.,None,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 3:19 pm -04:00,Well there could still be a limiter on how often submissions could be made for example once every 1/2 hour instead of every hour?  Every 15 minutes?  Or provide the unit test script. :-),None,0
