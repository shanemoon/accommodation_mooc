Thursday August 22nd 2013 9:16 pm -04:00,Heres another way of looking at the problem....In question 15 we are looking at a user defined function.  Since you got the right answer you probably understand what the function is doing yes?So Ill focus on the part of your question that asks what bigger means.  When a user creates a function they can give it any name they like however confusing it might be to someone else reading the code later.  In one sense bigger means no more and no less than what the return statement tells us it means.  You could create a function of your own that does what bigger does and give it a more meaningful name.  At the simplest possible level though what the function bigger does is to act on a parameter named x and make a bigger number (by taking the user supplied value of x and raising it the the x power).Does that explanation help at all?,None,0
