Friday September 20th 2013 2:41 am -04:00,Does anyone have completed the multiples of 3 and 5 problem?If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5 we get 3 5 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.This is my examples:def mul3and5(number):    (int) -> int    Return the sum of numbers less than number that are multiples by 3 or 5.    >>> mul3and5(10)    23    >>> mul3and5(30)    195    >>> mul3and5(300)    20850    >>> mul3and5(500)    57918    So what are your examples?,None,0

Everyone can access the problems easily.There is not any code in my post and I also do not show the correct answers of the Euler problem. I just give some examples that resulted from my code.,None,0
