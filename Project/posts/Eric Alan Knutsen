Wednesday August 28th 2013 5:00 pm -04:00,Ive attempted every test in the docstring with success. And although Ive gotten 40 / 41 points Im a little annoyed with it not accepting the code to satisfy the following test:student: test_time_to_utc.TestTimeToUTC.test_day_behindFAILUREMethod Description:Test the values where time in time zone UTC+0 is just before midnight        but time in time zone utc_offset is just after midnight.        (This means that UTC+0 is earlier than time zone utc_offset.)Could someone please give me a test that I can run to figure out the issue?Thanks!Eric, Unresolved,0

Thursday August 29th 2013 4:14 am -04:00,I havent found an example that doesnt work yet Im missing one mark from the whole assignment. (Am I allowed to share a snippet of code to show my logic?), Unresolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 1:12 pm -04:00,Those seem fine to me.For my issue of not passing one of the tests here is my three part if statement to cover all eventualities...[~ep]CheersEric                                          [Edited: see below ~ep], Unresolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 1:34 pm -04:00,Gotcha! Im feeling a bit dim now...although the other function worked! Im submitting yet again.Thanks!Eric, Unresolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 1:37 pm -04:00,Still getting 40/41! Fail statement is below...Method Description:Test the values where time in time zone UTC+0 is just before midnight        but time in time zone utc_offset is just after midnight.        (This means that UTC+0 is earlier than time zone utc_offset.)Message:FAILURE: AssertionError23.0 != -1.0 within 7 places, Unresolved,0
