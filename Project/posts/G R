Friday October 4th 2013 8:47 pm -04:00,   It is to my understanding according to the assignment 3 handout and from the forums that the code for board_contains_word_in_row is complete.    I completed the make_str_from_row and  make_str_from_column codes.Being that the code from board_contains_word_in_row relies on the  make_str_from_row that means my  make_str_from_row code is incorrect.    it looks something like this###code####iterater =      for i in board[row_index]:       iterater = iterater.join(board[row_index])        return iterater#####end of code####all the tests on this code are right but when applied to the board_contains_word all my results are false.any and all input will be appreciated., Unresolved,0

Saturday October 5th 2013 2:38 am -04:00,I also tried the code without a loop previously ###code## .join(board [row_index])) ###end of code####(Theres a specified row_index from which you have to return a str) . And my board_contains_row was still incorrect. , Unresolved,0
