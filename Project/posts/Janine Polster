Sunday August 18th 2013 10:19 pm -04:00,Hello from Fremantle Australia. I plan to study CS nect year so I try to learn as much as possible to prepare myself. Taught myself a bit of Java recently and really found a passion for programming.  Good luck to all of you!,None,3
Wednesday September 4th 2013 7:46 am -04:00,As a lot of people said logical analytical thinking are more important. But usually (at least the people I know) people who are good in logical and analytical thinking are good in math and vice versa.,None,0
Monday August 19th 2013 7:03 am -04:00,he said: first Python evaluates the expression right of the = sign. In this case it evaluates to 120.0 and this value is stored in the variable area.If you ask for area later it already has the value 120.0. It never knew that the values for height and base changed., Resolved,1
Monday August 19th 2013 6:39 am -04:00,took me a little bit of time as well to figure this out ;) , Resolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 6:36 am -04:00,Also it really makes sense to know the precedence of operator and how they are written like the exponential operator or the mod operator., Resolved,1
Monday August 19th 2013 11:18 am -04:00,did you find your idle app? Or are you using another IDE?, Resolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 11:38 am -04:00,because you need to pass the parameters height and base to the function.The words you used in the definition are just for the reader to better understand what these parameters are. But it still would work if you would call them apple and pear.When you call the function area you have to pass parameters to it. For example the two variables you used before. --> area(base height)... but you can use normal values as well --> area(5 2) as long as the parameters are from the same type there are the same amount of parameters as in the definition.Sorry if that might sound confusing. I hope it makes it any clearer., Resolved,3

Monday August 19th 2013 10:01 pm -04:00,Ich mach den Kurs (u.a.) weil mich Programmieren im Generellen sehr fasziniert. Ich bin gerade dabei mir etwas Java beizubringen und da kann etwas Seiteneinblick aus Python-Sicht nicht schaden ;) Außerdem möchte ich nächstes Jahr ein Informatik-Studium anfangen und dafür versuche ich so gut wie möglich Vorkenntnisse zu gewinnen.In punkto HangOut könnte es bei mir schwierig werden da ich auf der anderen Seite des Globus wohne und auch ab und zu mal schlafen und essen muss :) Aber an Diskussionen etc. nehm ich gern teil!,None,0

Thursday August 22nd 2013 8:40 am -04:00,So ganz sicher bin ich mir da nicht aber ich glaube sie meinen dass Du in Python Variablen nicht ausdrücklich deklarieren musst d.h. angeben musst von welchem Typ die Variable ist. In Java zum Beispiel schreibst Du:public int zahl = 1;Und dann ist die Variable zahl für den Rest der Laufzeit vom Typ int. Während ich bei Python sagen kann:zahl = 1   # hier ist zahl ein integerzahl = eins # hier ist zahl ein String,None,2
Tuesday August 27th 2013 3:21 am -04:00,Als ordentlicher würde ich es nicht bezeichnen....wie Daniel schon meint für Ordnung und Struktur ist der Entwickler zuständig. Es ist nur so dass wenn Du von einer Programmier-Sprache kommst bei der du explizit den Typ mit angeben musst dann wirkt Python vielleicht etwas.... wie soll ich sagen... wild?!,None,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 11:27 pm -04:00,When an answer option is ticked green after testing it doesnt mean the actual term is correct in relation to the question. But whether you ticked or unticked it correctly.If the question is to tick the right answers. And you leave the wrong answers blank the program will give you a green tick because you answered it correctly.Might be a bit confusing.,None,1
Tuesday August 20th 2013 12:32 pm -04:00,It just means that in case of several addition/subtraction(multiplication/divison) operators the most left operator has a higher precedence. Next the second to the left etc., Resolved,0

Tuesday August 27th 2013 5:40 am -04:00,No.  is the newline character in Python. But \\ is the character for a backslash. When you write: >>> print(\ ............)Python will print a backslash as \\ is the escape sequence for a backslash. Next it will print n without a new line as the backslash for a new line is already used for printing a backslash.hard to explain did you get it?, Resolved,7
Tuesday August 27th 2013 7:48 pm -04:00,When you have a function with a return statement(like in this question) try not to think of it as a function but a variable(!!!I know that this is no prope  name for variable!!!):count_vowels(hello) == 2count_consonants(hello) == 3count_letters(hello) == ? + ?Now since you have no hello or any other actual argument in a function but only a parameter (in this case word) you have to use this.I dont think this question is tricky or described more complicated than it should. It is definetely resolvable with watching the video and reading the question very carefully.                   [I made a slight edit to your (helpful) post ~ep]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\color{green}{ext{[I made a slight edit to your (helpful) post ~ep]}}Thanks man!

Tuesday August 27th 2013 8:46 am -04:00,Your error message says that one of your operands which you use is the wrong type for operator - ... maybe you have an error in the return statement and accidentally converted to a wrong type.... what surprises me is that the examples from the docstring apparently work fine... its hard to say without seeing your code.Edit: Maybe you have an error when converting to a 24 hour clock?, Unresolved,1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 9:37 am -04:00,Is there a precondition for the to_24_hour_clock() fuction??? (Edit: found it :D but that shouldnt be much of a problem)hm.... seems fine to me.... is there a chance you didnt save it properly or submitted the wrong .py-file?, Unresolved,1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 9:04 am -04:00,well say you have a function that calculates the square of a number:def square(num):    return num ** 2and now you want to calculate the half of a square of a number. You can either do it like this:def half_square(num):    return (num ** 2) / 2but this is redundant as you already defined a function which calculates the square of a number.But you can use this function (youve already defined) inside your new function but make sure that you use the values provided by the function youre about to write(ie. parameters or variables defined in the function body):def half_square(num):    return square(num) / 2Its more or less the same like using a built-in function inside a self-defined function., Resolved,9
Tuesday August 27th 2013 11:41 am -04:00,hm.. the code works for me.... when you defined that function did you press enter twice after the return statement?,None,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 11:39 am -04:00,No. You can use single quotes for multiline commenting you just have to use the same for beginning and ending it.,None,0

Wednesday August 28th 2013 1:22 am -04:00,A return statement returns a value and then directly exits the function that means that if you put a print statement after it it will give you an Sytax error as the function can never reach that statement., Resolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 8:35 am -04:00,That wont work as the function will exit after the return statement. Itll give you an syntax error as the function will never reach the print statement., Resolved,1
Thursday August 29th 2013 1:17 am -04:00,First its not unreachable. Second because its important to know. Later when you write more complex programs you wwill thank them for teaching you stuff like this. I wish other courses I took would have been this direct., Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 5:27 pm -04:00,Because the function definition says it should print the sum is (whatever your number is squared). It wont store the result in a variable. Thats why your variable answer_print is empty., Resolved,0

Thursday August 29th 2013 3:38 am -04:00,Because in Python 2 the /-operator means integer division. If the actual result is 0.6666 etc.  it will make an int out of it and just cuts the part behind the comma. Upgrade to Python 3 and you have to call integer division explicitely by using // ., Unresolved,2
Saturday August 31st 2013 10:59 am -04:00,a print statement returns always without quotes... it is printed to the user. You dont want the user to see the quotes. They are only for the program to use. So it knows that Canada is a string and not a variable or whatever. I, Unresolved,0

Saturday August 31st 2013 10:52 am -04:00,as Ricardo said when you just write yesno its only a representation of a string. Thats why there are also single quotes. If you put a string in a print statement you would get yes and no in diferent lines., Unresolved,0

You wouldnt call any function because function names are followed by parentheses () in which you can have parameters. And exactly these parameters you need to calculate the semiperimeter. Otherwise Python wouldnt know which arguments to use., Unresolved,0
