Tuesday August 20th 2013 7:02 am -04:00,I agree with Gerry. I tookÂ An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python and I had great fun. I even did get the signature track accomplishment certificate. I am still doing this course [LtP: fundamentals] because I missed it last year and the second part was a bit too steep for me. I know after watching few lectures from last year that this course is very good and lets you build good programming habits which is useful if you are thinking to become a professional in the future.
