This means that the return value should be in the range 0 to 23 inclusive.)I think this is why people are confused it says you need to call the other function in the guide., Resolved,7
Saturday August 31st 2013 5:02 pm -04:00,I did each function and then submitted my work. I also submitted more then once per hour and it still took the file and graded it instantly. If you submit after every function you can slowly build your program and make sure every step works. Just check out the summary to make sure you last submission/function passed everything., Resolved,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 3:52 pm -04:00,Also if you are having issues and the autograder is working. Submit after each function. I did it that way to make sure each step worked and was right. A few times mine worked fine in the testing but the autograder didnt like it. , Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 3:55 pm -04:00,you are looking at 9 seconds being 15% of a minute. The formula is read in hours so 9 seconds is 9/3600ths of an hour. Hope that helps., Unresolved,1
Sunday September 1st 2013 3:49 pm -04:00,You are probably over thinking it. You dont need to code in the precondition. You need to follow their instructions and have to_24_hour_clock call the right formula. All you are doing is returning the result of to_24_hour_clock. You just have to get the right parameter to send to to_24_hour_clock. That Ill leave up to you look at the examples. Youll smack yourself at the end when you get it. Dont overthink it., Unresolved,2

Monday September 23rd 2013 9:47 am -04:00,Not sure if its acceptable to plug other sites but some free learn at your own pace sites like http://www.codecademy.com or look at reddit.com/r/learnprogrammingAlso a fun way to learn python is with http://www.checkio.org/  Its a game that gives you problems to solve but it doesnt have a lot of hand holding. Its just you and a coder with some forums for questions. However it is very fun as once you have submitted a working solution to a problem you can see others solutions and learn from some amazing coders. Ive done programs there that took 15-30 lines of code only to see the top coder do it in 3. Will give you various ways to get a problem done as well as uses of some code that you may not see elsewhere.,None,4
