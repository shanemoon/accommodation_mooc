Tuesday August 20th 2013 6:21 pm -04:00,Im trying to create the triangle.py module but there is no save options in my tool bar. Im using Python on Ubuntu and Im able to create different profile which at first I assumed was creating a module. Ive tried switching users/profiles and Ive tried importing triangle. Nothing seems to work. How can I save the triangle module through the script? , Resolved,0
