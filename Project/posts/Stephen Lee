Thursday September 5th 2013 10:07 am -04:00,Hi there great tips here!  Just as a hint the first example should show you want they want to see.  The argument to_float_hours(0 15 0) means they want to represent  0 hours 15 minutes and 0 seconds in hour units.15 mins = .25 hour (or a quarter of an hour).  So take your 15 minutes and divide it by 60 to get hours.  15/60 = 1/4 or 0.25, Unresolved,0

Thursday September 19th 2013 4:38 am -04:00,I havent submitted the assignment yet but I have made a working one line statement you need to look at the count function from the str Methods lecture.  Pay attention to the white_rabbit example., Resolved,1
Thursday September 19th 2013 10:09 am -04:00,I spend hours on this then I tried it in the Vizualiser with examples (just added arguments at the bottom) and I could see where my code was failing.  Very difficult question and I was barking up the wrong tree for ages.  Needed to combine for loop and count methods so it was excellent revision for me.  Submitted and was successful.  The threads were helpful., Resolved,0
