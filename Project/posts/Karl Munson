Sunday September 1st 2013 8:22 pm -04:00,thinking through step by step.2 functions known:a - one that tells you the capital of a country when pass it the country nameb - one that tells you which of 2 words you pass it is the longest.we known country names...   country1 & country2so we could do it steps.  first get the names of the capitals:capital1 = get_capital(country1)capital2 = get_capital(country2)Then find out which of the 2 is the longer word:longer(capital1 capital2)But we are learning how to use info returned from 1 function within another function call so want to do it all in 1 step... thus without involving the variables capital1 & capital2.  Question is... how do you replace the variables capital1 & capital2 above with the function calls directly when call function longer., Unresolved Locked,6

Wednesday September 4th 2013 5:24 pm -04:00,are you suredef average_grade(grade1 grade2):is exactly what you have?no misspelt grade1?  maybe garde1..  or grad1 by mistake?the def line is where the 2 variables are defined...Only way I could repeat the error was when I haddef average_grade(grad1 grade2): or some other name as variable name and had correct  grade1 later in code, Resolved,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 12:22 am -04:00,I have made it through the assignment to step 4.written my code.Am then told If the example calls return the expected results and you pass all the tests when you submit move on to Step 4. Otherwise modify your code and repeat the tests.So back to step 4 I go...  endless...:)maybe it just me - but I am finding the exercises harder than the assignments.But having fun .... learning a new language., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 12:39 am -04:00,maybe have another int variable which you use to  keep track of how many times been through loop? increase it every time through the loop.char_number = 0for char in sample_string:   print(sample_string[char_number])   char_number = char_number + 1, Resolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 5:14 pm -04:00,you have a function. one of those to test.now you have to put information through the function.so will need to make the function run.could run the function directly...cap_song_repetition([Lola Venus Lola Lola Let It Be Lola ABC Cecilia Lola Lola]Lola), Resolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 12:39 am -04:00,playlist = [Lola Venus Lola Lola Let It Be Lola ABC Cecilia Lola Lola] - song listthe - song list should not be there.  remove it.playlist = [Lola Venus Lola Lola Let It Be Lola ABC Cecilia Lola Lola]song = Lolacap_song_repetition(playlist song)print(playlist)cap_song_repetition()  is a function that has no return statement within itself.. so None is printed if try to print result directly.playlist has its items altered by the function.  So to see what the function has done you must print contents of playlist.#Edit: is it just me or is the default editor here annoying? when have a word or 2 in bold and copy paste the line - the editor gets really confused and stuffs everything up., Resolved,1
Friday September 20th 2013 6:34 pm -04:00,4 possible solutions are provided.  not all will work.Isnt python giving you an error telling you that that solution is not the correct one?Use help(List)look up the types each function wants or returns..remove() wants a value.  this value will then be removed from the list.  in this case list is all str so value must be a str..index() return an integer..pop() wants an integer.In your case.  index is returning an integer.  On first run through that is a 0. .remove is then trying to remove the first occurance of 0 in the list.  The list is of song names and none of them are the integer 0.. so python throwing an error.  Its way of saying - I cant find a 0 in the list., Resolved,2
Sunday September 22nd 2013 10:59 pm -04:00,might be easier if start from scratch1) what is in playlist.py    for me - this file was only 3 lines long. i editted it for each possible solutionI found if tried commenting other options out and adding / removing comments each time - I got confused.   keep things simple is my needed method2) what are you entering into idle?     I re-typed 4 lines each time after edditing the playlist.py file and running the module.try code for 1 possible solution at a time.  remember 4 possible options - not all will work. they may cause an error in python - or may pass pythons check and just have logic errors., Resolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 11:28 pm -04:00,ok. ignore python.maybe try to think through each possible solution logically. to start with.  and then come back to python?, Resolved,1
Sunday September 22nd 2013 11:41 pm -04:00,ok...this is my playlist.py for first example. only the 3 lines. these are given by the question.  I have removed all comments for brevity heredef cap_song_repetition(playlistsong):    while playlist.count(song) > 3:        playlist.remove(song)i then run the module.it does mean I have to then type more into idle each time I want to try each examplefirst set the variable playlist with complete list of songnames as question shows them.then - function wants a variable that has the song name that we only want to hear 3 times - so set that. then I run the function... and finally print out the contents of the playlist after the function has runplaylist = [Lola Venus Lola Lola Let It Be Lola ABC Cecilia Lola Lola]song = Lolacap_song_repetition(playlist song)print(playlist)you will need to change the 2nd and 3rd lines of the playlist.py file for each example - run module and retype all 4 lines in idle.all 4 may not run correctly.  be that programmitically or logically.If python errors... try to figure out why?  what does the error message actually mean., Resolved,2
Tuesday September 17th 2013 11:53 pm -04:00,the function alters the items in the list L and because L and values both refer to same memory address.. it alters items in valuesbut the function has no Return statement - it gave no info back to the print statement - thus the None, Unresolved,1
Sunday September 22nd 2013 6:06 pm -04:00,When the visualizer starts. it looks at the first line of your code.. and sees def increment_items(L increment):it thinks. def statement means.. a function is to follow. It ignores it for now... but knows.. everything following that is indented text is also part of the function. so jumps past all of it. values = [1 2 3]The first line of your program... so it creates the variable and assigns wanted values to that variable print(increment_items(values 2))this step is not one instruction.  it is 2 different instructions.we want to print the returned info from the increment_values function.increment_items(values 2)to do that we must first run increment_values. we pass the memory location of values tothe function.when info is passed to a function - a reference to the same memory address is passed it does not create a new variable.lists are mutable - any change to them is done in place.  values  and L always both point to same memory addressstr & int are not mutable. any change to them is actually not a change.  A whole new variable is created. thus breaking the connection between the variable outside the function and the variable inside the functionWhat this means here is any changes within the function are being done to the original  values  at same time.  they are the same list.when the function finishes we move back to the print statement. print(None)The increment_items function has no return statement. thus python returns None.  this is what is printed. print(values)we then print out the variables values contents.these have been changed by the function. #sorry for numerous edits. my formatting kept getting changed by the editor., Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 17th 2013 11:34 pm -04:00,letters = letters.sort() #is asking to assign the info returned by letters.sort() to lettersletters.sort() does not return a value.. when a function has no return statement within itself - None is returned. .. and is therefore assigned to lettersletters.sort() sorts the items within letters internally. no external interaction., Resolved,8
Sunday September 22nd 2013 10:44 pm -04:00,>>> numbers = numbers.reverse()>>> print(numbers)None>>> numbers>>>numbers.reverse()  reverses the list order - but returns norhing.take the line 1 step at a time.1) you are asking python to firstly run the function .reverse2) assign the return value from that function to variable  numbersso we haveresult of step 1 is - reverse function is reversing the order of items in the list.at this point  - numbers list is reversed  [3 4 1]that reverse is not being shown anywhere.but this is only half way through what you are asking python to do on the 1 linethe function returns None.step 2 - then assigns that returned value into the variable numbers.  overwriting its current content.the function .reverse has no actual return value... so python assigns None to the variable.numbers now contains None.  if you print its contents - it shows None.  If you ask python to show the contents - it shows nothing - and that is what is being shown by the last line., Resolved,1
Friday September 20th 2013 3:56 am -04:00,Correct..  if no return statement within function  None is returnedIts Pythons way of saying - the function did not have any instruction to return any value when this function ended but you want me to assign the result to a variable... so I will assign None...  since I dont know what else you expect me to do., Resolved,3
Saturday September 21st 2013 9:03 am -04:00,If we look at help for List.sort it sayssort(...)   -> NoneThink of when you shuffle a deck of cards.  You start with a deck of cards - you shuffle them.The actual act of shuffling the cards is the function.  It returned None.  We will ignore the cards that we had to pick up off the floor after we dropped them and pretend it never happened.  Within the shuffling function it reordered the cards.The only way to know the new order of the cards is to look at the deck.The same with the list - the values within the list are sorted - but no info is passed out of the function.  You must look at the list later to see the new order. , Resolved,1

Wednesday September 18th 2013 12:47 am -04:00,as part of testing  - to see if my thoughts agreed with python I wrote a function sort(L)def sort(L):	L.sort()	return LIf that existed elsewhere in code then another answer was also correct.  So I checked 1 more option than was expected.Meant I got 13.75 out of 14.00.First errors so far. :(I suppose I should assume that unless it says otherwise... the only code we have is that given.  None other relevant to answer exists., Unresolved,0
