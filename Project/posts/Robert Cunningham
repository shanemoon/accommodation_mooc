Tuesday October 1st 2013 2:46 am -04:00,I have solved every other coding task in Assignment 6 but for some reason the solution to read_board eludes me. I have gotten every single kind of output except for the correct one! Would someone PLEASE explain to me how to break each line of the file into its characters and put them in list. Here is my latest attempt:board=    row=        for line in board_file:        for i in line:            if i !=:                row.append(i)           return rowAny help would be greatly appreciated thank you!, Resolved,0

None of the posts addressed the exact gap in my knowledge that prevented me from finding the solution however so I made my own post.Thanks so much for you input...I actually finished up the program very shortly after making the post 37/37 yay!, Resolved,0
