Wednesday September 18th 2013 3:40 am -04:00,Hi Im also having the same problem with this function. Below is my code (not sure if I can paste code here). The output in shell is fine but while submitting I get an error. def is_valid_sequence(dna):     (str) -> bool    Return True if and only if the DNA sequence is valid    (that is it contains no characters other than A T C and G).    >>> is_valid_sequence(ATCGGC)    True    >>> is_valid_sequence(ATCTA)    True    >>> is_valid_sequence(atcggc)    False    >>> is_valid_sequence(AAAAGCATCTA)    True    >>> is_valid_sequence(WXYZACKJ)    False        result = False        for char in dna:        if char not in ATCG:            result = False        else:            result = True                return result, Resolved,0

Thursday October 3rd 2013 11:46 am -04:00,Are you returning the score in update score? If yes then dont do it. Thats the mistake that I did. You just have 7 points to score. , Resolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 12:58 pm -04:00,Why are you opening a file? The file is already open so skip it. Just use the variable to read etc. This applies for both read word list and read board. , Resolved,0

Here is my code. def update_score(player_info word):     ([str int] list str) -> NoneType    player_info is a list with the players name and score. Update player_info    by adding the point value word earns to the players score.    >>> update_score([Jonathan 4] ANT)        ##check if the word in the correct word.        new_score = 0    if player_info[0] != :        current_score = player_info[1]        new_score = current_score + word_score(word)        player_info[1] = new_score    return player_info            ## if the word is correct then update the score    ##call the word_score function to update the score, Resolved,0
