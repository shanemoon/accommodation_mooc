Friday October 4th 2013 2:26 am -04:00,Hi guys! I need help with read_words. I encountered a MemoryError while executing my code in the shell.Here is my code for def read_words:    words =     line = words_file.readline()    while line != :        words.append(line)    return words*NOTE: In the code above I have not included the part to strip away the newline character. I wanted to test whether this worked before I did that.I executed the code in the shell using:read_words(open(/path/wordlist1.txt r))At first I there was no output but after letting it run for about 5 minutes this came out:Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#63> line 1 in <module>    read_words(open(/path/wordlist1.txt)  File /path/a3.py line 169 in read_words    words.append(line)MemoryError, Resolved,0
