Monday September 9th 2013 3:13 pm -04:00,s1.find(s2int(s1.find(s2) + 1))Ok so:single expression - checkno square brackets - checkonly call str.find and use the arithmetic operators (+ - etc.). - check ( I think)so....still not seeing my problem. Also I did many tests in idle and am sure it is working properly., Resolved,2
Monday September 16th 2013 3:57 pm -04:00,Im at this question and am not sure what it is they are asking. Do they want what returns 3 and only 3 occurrences of lola or is anything up to and including 3 occurrences of lola acceptable?For example if one of the functions returned 2 occurrences of the song lola would that be a right function? , Unresolved,0
