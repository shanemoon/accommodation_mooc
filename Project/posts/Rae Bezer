Monday August 19th 2013 2:23 pm -04:00,A study group for those of us who have little or no understanding of programming.  Here we can share problems worries discussions etc.There are also some guidelines for asking for help which you can see here:[How to get help],None,44
Monday August 19th 2013 2:42 pm -04:00,Welcome to all who join! I doubt that this will be a group that will meet given that its not concerning a geographic region but hopefully well still be able to support each other on this programming journey! ,None,0
Monday August 19th 2013 6:07 pm -04:00,The more the merrier Gerry.  It will probably be beneficial to us too given that you have experience in programming and most of us have none at all!  ,None,0
Monday August 26th 2013 9:39 pm -04:00,for 2. the division operator you are using returns float numbers only.  To return an int you either need to declare an int in the return statement (as shown in 3. or you need to use the integer division operator //.HTH.,None,0
Monday August 26th 2013 9:39 pm -04:00,I have a different body part than the answer gives but so far all the tests Ive done return correct answers:return abs(day1 - day2) // 7Instead of asking it to return type int i have instead used the integer division operator.  Can i do this?  Would this still count as a correct answer?,None,0
Friday August 30th 2013 1:47 am -04:00,Yes if my Maths part of the return statement was long I just went back over it and tried to simplify wherever possible.  Once I knew that my formulas worked - no matter how long winded - it was really easy to go back and revise them to make them look more elegant wherever possible., Pinned Resolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 12:14 am -04:00,I agree with Jim.People are making the statements more complicated than they need to be.  I thought the same in the discussion regarding certain questions in Exercise 2.  In fact when reading the comments made about Exercise 2 it really worried me! I thought that I wouldnt understand it.I think we all need to bear in mind that this is a beginners course and we wouldnt be asked to do anything in the assignment that we havent covered in the lecture material.  Whilst the pages of instructions for the assignment may seem daunting once you actually read through it all what we are being asked to write (e.g. one line of the function code) isnt that difficult at all.  When it comes to writing the 3 full functions if you follow the Function Design Recipe video and if you read the other functions properly it isnt that bad!I think that the other thing beginners need to be aware of is that it isnt a race to complete.  Whilst there is a deadline I gave myself from Thursday to Sunday to complete the assignment.  I finished it all on the Thursday and didnt need the extra days but just because others finished in a few hours doesnt mean that we all will (or that we all should for that fact!).  , Pinned Resolved,12
Friday August 30th 2013 1:45 am -04:00,I submitted after every step.  The facility is there for us to use so take full advantage I say!  It was really useful to know I was on the right track.  It boosted my confidence to go on and complete the next step and so on., Pinned Resolved,9
Friday August 30th 2013 10:06 pm -04:00,HiGo back to the video on Function Design Recipe. If you havent already take notes on the 6 steps of the Function Design Recipe.  What each of them are what do they do and what each part looks like in a function definition.Then look at each function definition in the a1 file - print the text if necessary (I did).  Are all the steps there?  Once youve done that go back to the assignment handout and just go through step 2.  Nothing else just step 2 using both the design recipe the a1 file and the assignment handout.  See if anything jumps out at you.HTH, Pinned Resolved,4
Friday August 30th 2013 10:13 pm -04:00,Just wanted to add that the taking the first step on this assignment is the hardest... not because its the trickiest it isnt or most complex (it isnt) but because most of us have never done this before. The whole assignment handout seemed so daunting to me but just taking that first step checking the code using the submit function and realising I had it right boosted my confidence to the point that the whole assignment didnt seem so scary anymore!There really isnt anything in there that hasnt been covered in the material its just a matter of us all training our brains to be able to see what is wrong with the code in much the same way as we have when we see a word that is spelt incorrectly.  Good luck., Pinned Resolved,9
Friday August 30th 2013 10:27 pm -04:00,Youre welcome.  We are all here to help each other.  Take your time with it.  You dont have to complete all the steps at once.  Let me know how you get on with this approach., Pinned Resolved,2
Friday August 30th 2013 2:11 am -04:00,Im in too! I think that this scheme is great!What do we need to do?  Just read the forums and post replies whenever we can?  , Approved,1

Monday September 2nd 2013 12:52 am -04:00,The way I read it was that they forgot to add a test (presumably the call to_24_hour_clock but we dont know that for sure).  However since lots of people had submitted already the didnt want to penalise anyone.  Therefore the total amount the assignment is graded from remains at 41.  But because they added the test in the maximum marks you can achieve is now 42. If you have 41/41 then to get 42 you need to ensure that you have followed all instructions to the letter and you should receive the 42.  I have 42 and ensured that I called the above function but I forgot about it the first time I submitted and still achieved full marks for this step.  I realised my error and resubmitted and still got the same marks. Its only now that my marks have gone up to 42., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 5:52 pm -04:00,I created one.  Once you have changed the a1_histfilename to asksaveas you have to specify a file to save as or you get an error message back.I literally created one with the same name and extension as Paul uses just so I would have something to select when running the program.I thought this lecture was very informative and extremely useful but I think that this point should have been explained more clearly. , Unresolved,2
Saturday September 28th 2013 6:00 pm -04:00,Thanks Tom for telling us that.  I just wanted to highlight that this wasnt explained in the lecture (Paul already had one created) and when I tried following along realising I had no file made me confused.  I just went back to my documents and created a file so that I would have something to select. If Paul had explained in the lecture that we could create a file for ourselves here it would have saved me some time and a lot of head scratching! It maybe useful for them to note this for future runs of this great course! , Unresolved,2

Sunday September 29th 2013 1:42 pm -04:00,Slowly working my way through this assignment and so far all seems to be working.However upon reaching this function call I feel stumped.The way I read it I think I need to call 3 functions within this function call:make_str_from_rowmake_str_from_columnboard_contains_wordmake_str_from_row and make_str_from column both return Type str whilst board_contains_word returns Type bool.I understand that the function wants me to return an int.However I just dont know where to start.... Can anyway just point me in the right direction to getting started with this function please?, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 2:51 pm -04:00,Ok so let me see if I understand this correctly...The make_str_from_row and make_str_from_column functions are called within the board_contains_word_in_row and board_contains_word_in_column functions respectively.  The board_contains_word_in_row and board_contains_row_within_column functions are both called within the board_contains_word function so this is the only function I need to call directly.  Is this right?I still dont know how to start the function body off though. I think I understand what I need the function to achieve but Ive been going through this for a couple of hours now and I still cant work out how to start it off., Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 3:18 pm -04:00,Sorted!! Thanks so much for your help! I had the counter variable (initialised to 0) but just couldnt get started from there... was using too many functions... Once I just had the one to call and knowing that we should have a loop really helped!! , Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 3:06 pm -04:00,I think so... will give it a go now!Thanks for your help!, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 3:11 pm -04:00,Looking at the above instructions it seems you need to call the board_contains_word function... not the board_contains_word_in_column function., Resolved,1
Sunday September 29th 2013 3:20 pm -04:00,I think as well its good practice to call other previously created functions. If you have already created functions that you know are correct and have worked under all test conditions it means that you are less likely to make any syntax errors because you arent typing as much., Resolved,0
