Thursday September 26th 2013 2:21 am -04:00,Im having the same issue as Sandy.  My average is the number at index [0][1] in the list divided by the length of the nested list.  I cannot work out why the function adds up all the items at index [1] within the indices in the list.  Heres the code Im entering:>>> def calculate_average(asn_grades):    total = 0    for item in asn_grades:        total = total + item[1]        return total/len(asn_grades)    >>> calculate_average([[A1 90] [A2 80]])45.0What am I doing wrong here?  Thanks, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 8:01 am -04:00,Thanks I figured it out.  It looks like I had the return line tabbed over too far so it was just returning:total = total + item[1]...     return total  /  len(asn_grades)and not  all the lines of the function., Resolved,0
