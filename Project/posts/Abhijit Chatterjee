Tuesday October 1st 2013 2:59 pm -04:00,Hi guys!My assignment was great till I stumbled across the last two questions in it. I have watched the week 6 videos but I am still hopelessly confused. What am I supposed to do for thee questions?I copy-pasted the information from the internet about the words-list and the board into my Idle saved it in .txt files but couldnt open then when I used their location in my open() function. Help please! I feel so stupid right now, Unresolved,0

Thursday October 3rd 2013 6:26 am -04:00,Hi guys!I just finished my assignment 3 (week 6) and I submitted it but my score was 24. I spent the last hour checking and re-submitting my assignment but my score didnt change. My functions work for ALL the examples in the docstrings. The only thing that I thought might be affecting my score is that I sometimes used functions like make_str_from_row in other functions. Is this the problem?I really cant find any other problem. Avery example I put in the function gives desired resultsThanks guyes!, Unresolved,0
