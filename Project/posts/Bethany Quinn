Monday August 26th 2013 6:38 pm -04:00,Its pretty confusing the way its written - in the summary they strongly encourage you to go through the exercise with the visualizer but its less clear that youre supposed to do that/what youre supposed to be paying attention to in the video. In the first week they mentioned the order in which rules etc. are executed but its pretty vague at the time (or seemingly self-explanatory until you get the questions wrong at the end of this video). It might be helpful to recap those rules/orders in this video (as such) and/or to be clearer about why the red/green lines are where they are (because they dont go in order).Â , Unresolved,2
