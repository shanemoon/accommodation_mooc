Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:20 pm -04:00,Ok this doesnt seem like a very helpful or constructive question and quite honestly its confusing people. Myself included. Ive been programming in Java for about a year now (which I know isnt a lot of time) but I understand how to call a function within another function and I STILL couldnt get the question correct. [code removed]I mean I got them wrong but I dont know what mistake I made. I feel like attempt 2 or 3 should be correct.Could anyone explain my mistake??, Unresolved,1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:55 pm -04:00,Oh... wow. Embarrassing. Always something little like that. Sorry totally my mistake I didnt get. I dont know why I was using an actual argument. Thanks!, Unresolved,1
Sunday September 29th 2013 11:31 pm -04:00,Hey guys Im working on A3 and Ive submitted my code to check to see if Im on the right track and on the detail submissions Im coding some failures on methods that are working properly and Im not sure why.Ive completed methods:is_valid_wordmake_str_from_rowmake_str_from_columnboard_contains_word_in_rowboard_contains_word_in_columnBut the only ones Im getting successes on are make_str_from_rowis_valid_wordWhen I test them calling the example calls all work correctly.Any ideas?, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 11:38 pm -04:00,The ones from the Autotesting?, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 11:43 pm -04:00,Ok well for example for make_str_from_column I get these messages from the AutoTeststudent: test_a3.Test_06_MakeStrFromColumn.test_01_return_typestudent: test_a3.Test_06_MakeStrFromColumn.test_02_middle_columnstudent: test_a3.Test_06_MakeStrFromColumn.test_03_end_columnsBut when I run the example call I return the correct string and when I change the column_index I return the correct string. What gives?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 12:06 am -04:00,Ok so look. I got the error student: test_a3.Test_06_MakeStrFromColumn.test_01_return_type which tells me thisMethod Description:NoneMessage:FAILURE: AssertionError<class NoneType> != <class str> : Expected a <code>str</code> to be returned.but when I do this in IDLEtype(make_str_from_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]] 1))I get this type(make_str_from_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]] 1))<class str>...? Wtf?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 12:20 am -04:00,make_str_from_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]] 3)TBTheyre all working correctly man. Its even saying that same error message for my methods that return Boolean values...whats going on??, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 12:25 am -04:00,Its returning the string. And are you sure we can post the code without getting in trouble?Here...indexString =     for i in range(len(board)):        indexString += board[i][column_index]    return indexString I mean Im not an idiot. Ive been programming for about a year now. Im taking this to learn python so I know the fundamentals. I feel like that is absolutely correct?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 12:34 am -04:00,Ok Im gonna delete the file redownload a3.py and the post all my code in it. Save it. Then resubmit it. I was uploading the correct file though. Ill give it a try. Thanks for the help sir!, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 12:37 am -04:00,Well I just resubmitted after following the steps I laid out above and it works now. All the methods Ive completed test correctly and Im getting the correct marks. I dont know what was happening before. Thank you!, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 12:51 am -04:00,Hi Sandy! Dont be discouraged every single person can learn to program. Have you tried asking specific questions on the methods youre having problems with? Dont give up! The hard deadline isnt until a week from now. , Unresolved,5
Monday September 30th 2013 2:49 am -04:00,This method should not return anything., Resolved,1
Monday September 30th 2013 1:32 am -04:00,Your code as of now is updating player_info to ONLY have the integer score. Its getting rid of the string attached to player_info, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 2:24 am -04:00,Hi Alison. You shouldnt be setting player_info to anything. You should only be updating the player_info integer that contains the score., Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 2:28 am -04:00,Sorry. Maybe I wasnt clear enough in my previous post. You SHOULD NOT be setting player_info to anything new. Just updating the score integer. You have the code to complete this method worked out already just get rid of the assignment statement., Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 2:32 am -04:00,Nice! Good to hear it worked out., Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 2:47 am -04:00,Ok well I feel like I could have confused you. You need ONE assignment state. How do you assign an update value to the previous value? Let me know if you have questions., Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 1:45 am -04:00,Are any of you taking this course coming from a different language and not liking Python? Im in college right now as a CS major and Im using Java and I really love it.When I come on here or read my book Python Programming: An Intro to CS by John Zelle I always feel kind of bummed out. I mean I still like doing it cause I enjoy learning more about CS and other languages but Im just really not seeming to like Python. I dont like the syntax.I know how the simplicity of the syntax for Python is supposed to be one of the greatest things about it but I just dont enjoy writing the code.Any opinions advice or questions?,None,0
Monday September 30th 2013 2:31 am -04:00,I plan on learning c++ fairly soon after completing this course and working through my python book. ,None,0
