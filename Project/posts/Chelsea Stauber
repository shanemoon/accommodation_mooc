Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:09 pm -04:00,HeySo I was under the impression that assignment 1 was due at 8:59 P.M. and was therefore very surprised when I submitted my work for zero points even though my code had passed all the tests. I had finished the assignment last night and would gladly have submitted it but I thought I had the time to more thoroughly review everything before turning it in today. Is there anyway I would perhaps get some type of partial credit for my work?This wont happen again.Chels, Unresolved,-1
