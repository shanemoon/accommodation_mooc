Sunday September 15th 2013 4:18 pm -04:00,Im having a problem with auto grader as well.  Im receiving failures on functions which Ive tested.  For example:my code for get_complementary_sequence yields the proper result when I test it in the shell: >>>get_complementary_sequence ( AT)TABut the auto grader marked it as a failure.Similarly I submitted the assignment after step 2 and received a 13/24 then submitted after step 4 and received 0/24; and I did nothing to my code for step 2., Unresolved,0

Sunday September 15th 2013 5:35 pm -04:00,Ive improved to 21/24 but would really like a 24/24.  My problem functions seem to be get_complementary sequence and get_complement.  The following are the errors Im receiving but Ive tested my functions and they give the proper results in the Python shell:Method Description:Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorError != TA- Error+ TA : Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?Method Description:Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences        of each nucleotide?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorError != TAGCTAGC- Error+ TAGCTAGC : Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences            of each nucleotide?Heres my code:   dna_sequence =     for nucleotide in dna:        if nucleotide in ACGT:            dna_sequence = dna_sequence + get_complement(nucleotide)        elif nucleotide not in ACGT:            dna_sequence= dna_sequence + Error    if Error in dna_sequence:        return Error    else:        return dna_sequence                    Method Description:Have you tested your function with all 4 nucleotides?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorError != T- Error+ T : Have you tested your function with all 4 nucleotides?Yes I have tested my function with all four nucleotides.Heres my code:if nucleotide is A:        return T    elif nucleotide is T:        return A    elif nucleotide is C:        return G    elif nucleotide is G:        return C    else:        return Error, Unresolved,0
