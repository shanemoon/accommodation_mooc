Wednesday September 18th 2013 9:21 am -04:00,sry for my unclear question. What I dont get is why that is not what is happening when it is in:digits = 0123456789result = for digit in digits:    result = result + digit * 2print(result)To me the above looks like  + 0123456789*2but I must be overlooking something, Resolved,0
