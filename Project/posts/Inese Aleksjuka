Sunday August 18th 2013 9:32 pm -04:00,I was watching another course that deals with programming in python and one of the users suggested to use Macs built-in terminal as a python alternative. So far its been working great and I wanted to know if I could use that instead of installing python 3?To use the built in python all you need to do is open up terminal and type in python and it will work just like that.,None,1
Sunday August 18th 2013 9:37 pm -04:00,Okay thats fine. I just wanted to know since I had tried to install python previously and it kept giving me an error in IDLE. Ill try again. Thank you,None,0
Sunday August 18th 2013 9:54 pm -04:00,This is what I get when I open up terminal and type in python:Python 2.7.2 (default Oct 11 2012 20:14:37) [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple Clang 4.0 (tags/Apple/clang-418.0.60)] on darwinType help copyright credits or license for more information.----This might be too complicated but I found a how-to on updating python on the mac going to try it now http://wolfpaulus.com/jounal/mac/installing_python_osx,None,0

Friday September 6th 2013 6:12 pm -04:00,The first time I did exercise 2 I received a mark of 8 out of 18. Needless to say I didnt really feel comfortable just leaving it like that and over the past 2 days I worked through the lectures once more tried running the questions in the visualizer and even had my husband look at it. Then I had 4 more questions that really stumped me and I decided to look on the forums to see if anyone who already had posted a discussion could point me in the right direction and it helped TREMENDOUSLY!!! I have never experienced such a phenomena where so many people are willing to help you along so you dont feel like giving up. I may be a beginner at this programming stuff but I feel like I can actually learn and accomplish something with this course.Thank You!!!!, Resolved,1
