Wednesday August 21st 2013 9:12 pm -04:00,Not sure when -- i hve not done the exercises yet.  However as I was listening to the lecture I was following along in IDLE.  I like to pause the lecture and play with the programming a little.  I stumbled across the same issue i.e. that Python doesnt automatically repoint variable z to the sum of x + y .  I think that is a little counterintuitive to a novice.  If you assign z = x + y I think the most natural thing to assume is that if you change the value of x or y then z would automatically update.  So it might bear pointing that out in the lecture., Resolved,1
