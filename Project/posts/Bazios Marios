Wednesday September 25th 2013 11:30 pm -04:00,from a quick view of your code im pretty sure you ve got 2 functions wrong...At first the is_valid_sequence function does not do what it is supposed to do...test it for example with  is_valid_sequence(ACGATT) which is a valid sequence...The second function is get_complementary_sequence...get_complementary_sequence(G) is valid and should return C. , Unresolved,0
