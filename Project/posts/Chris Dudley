Sunday August 25th 2013 11:20 pm -04:00,Didnt know where to post this question but here goesI was doing the exercises in the book and on chapter 3 question 7 the answer to the question uses the sum function. When I use the sum function like the answer does i get back an error saying that the sum function can only have 2 arguments but for the answer there are four:def top_three_average(grade1 grade2 grade3 grade4):	 (number number number number) -> number		total = sum(grade1 grade2 grade3 grade4)	top_three = total - min(grade1 grade2 grade3 grade4)	return top_three / 3>>> top_three_average(60 70 80 90)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#13> line 1 in <module>    top_three_average(60 70 80 90)  File <pyshell#12> line 5 in top_three_average    total = sum(grade1 grade2 grade3 grade4)TypeError: sum expected at most 2 arguments got 4I was wondering why the sum function here will not work? or if I am doing something wrong what am i doing wrong here? thanks, Resolved,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 11:48 pm -04:00,here is the books answerdef top_three_avg(grade1 grade2 grade3 grade4):     (number number number number) -> number    Return the average of the top three of grades grade1 grade2    grade3 and grade4.    >>> top_three_avg(50 60 70 80)    70         # Here is one solution that does not use average_grade from Q6.    total = sum(grade1 grade2 grade3 grade4)    top_three = total - min(grade1 grade2 grade3 grade4)    return top_three / 3, Resolved,0

Friday September 20th 2013 7:02 pm -04:00,I am going through the exercises in the book and I am on this one:Write a for loop to add 1 to all the values from whales from Section 8.1Storing and Accessing Data in Lists on page 129 and store the converted values in a new list called more_whales. The whales list shouldn’t be modified whales refers to [5 4 7 3 2 3 2 6 4 2 1 7 1 3].And this is what I cam up with and it does add 1 to each of the values but I cant for the life of me figure out how to convert the more_whales variable into a list in the for loop. it just prints the values individually on a single line. I keep getting the int object is not iterable error. here is my code:whales = [5 4 7 3 2 3 2 6 4 2 1 7 1 3]for i in whales:    more_whales = i + 1    print(more_whales), Resolved,0
