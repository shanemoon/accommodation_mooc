Monday September 16th 2013 5:37 am -04:00,Hello! Was reading discussions about this get_complementary code but still doing something wrong though. Can you please help me with pointing on my mistake?     complement=    for char in dna:            complement = get_complement(char)            dna = dna + complement            return dnaWhen I test it:>>> get_complementary_sequence(TA)TAAI understand that I just count together old dna sequence with new complement but how to replace it with that one x=x+1 statement? , Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 6:26 am -04:00,Thank you! The thing is i understand the idea complitely - what i need to do and how it should look in the end. The thing is I cant understand how to get complements all to gether to replace them. this row -> dna = dna + complement have tried different variations of it but highest is to get 2 complement characters not all. tried dna=complement+complement it just doubles 1 and the same. complememnt+get_complement(char) gives me 2 characters but its invalid with more. I just dont get how to make it take all the string in count. , Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 7:07 am -04:00,So if dna is just an input and im making new complement string by adding complemented characters from dna string i should return the new string which is defined as complement at the start of function. At the end it should contain all the characters of dna complemented. I need to complement all the characters not just first or first two and exit the loop in order to get return under the for. Probably im just thinking in some box because i cant find out how to complete the new string with all the complemented characters from dna. Is ok! :) Thank you very much for your help. Hopefully someone will post the answer after the deadline will pass.  , Resolved,0
