Tuesday August 20th 2013 3:30 am -04:00,In addition to the video lectures the in-video quizzes the weekly exercises and the suggested text I would like to suggest yet another helpful resource for this course. To aid in understanding the process of designing a program and its logic as well as how a program functions I have been reading Joyce Farrells Programming Logic and Design published by Thomson Course Technology.I acquired my copy years back for a different introductory programming course (my copy is the Third Edition). Heres a link to the listing for the book on Amazon:http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=joyce%20farrell%20programming%20logic%20and%20design I hope that this helps anyone whos able to acquire a copy. ,None,1
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 8:07 pm -04:00,There is an apparent issue with my expression for the get_seconds function. For some reason it is returning a remaining seconds amount for seconds below 60 or less than one minute. I dont know if I can post the code here because it is an assignment but I need some help figuring out what Im missing with this particular portion of the assignment. Is anyone else experiencing this issue?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:53 pm -04:00,Thank you for addressing this. Im not sure of the range I apologize. Ive written it so that it calls back to the to_24_hour_clock which in this case contains an argument for the seconds modulo sixty. This has served to return the correct amount of remaining seconds after the hour and minute amounts have been determined in the previous functions but for some reason seconds including 59 and below are returning a remaining seconds total. For example 59 seconds returns 11. , Unresolved,0
