Monday August 19th 2013 7:26 pm -04:00,round function works as follows:>>> round (15.1291232)we are telling python to round the value 15.129123 keeping only 2 decimal places then the result would>>> 15.13since the amount of rounding 15.129123 only shows 2 decimals after the point and rounds the number omitted in this case the number was 9 and that was still as it was more than five is rounded and complete the figure of 2 decimal places.>>> round (15.1291232)15.12912315.13 (rounded only shows 2 decimal places), Resolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 7:53 pm -04:00,We can also combine several operations:for example>>> round (pow (558) + 5.1292)or>>> round (5 ** 5 % 8 + 5.1292)is the same.and the result is:>>>  10.13python have told us round the amount of 5 ** 5 which is 125 split (%) 8 (residual) which is equal to 5 and we join with 5.129 which is 10.129 and we only show 2 decimal places 10.13 would be rounded off., Resolved,1

Monday August 19th 2013 3:10 pm -04:00,In this exercise:>>> z = 5>>> Y = y + 1>>> z = 10After These statements execute que of the Following That describe the values ​​z and y point to?- Z points to 5 and y points to 6- Z and y points to 10 points to 6- Z and y points to 10 points to 11- Z and y Both point to memory addressesfor me the correct answer is:z and y points to 10 points to 11 because the value of the variable z has been changed.However in the exercise indicates that the correct answer is:z and y points to 10 points to 6.I think that is correct if and only take into account what we are seeing at the moment but my reasoning tells me that 11 should be the value of z because it already has been given a new value to the variable z., Resolved,1
Monday August 19th 2013 3:32 pm -04:00,Forgiveness is all in lower case:>>> z = 5>>> y = z + 1>>> z = 10the problem is that z has a value of 5 then y has a value of z + 1 at that time would be 6 more then the value of z changed to 10 which would change the value of y the new value 10 + 1 = 11., Resolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 3:49 pm -04:00,then if the value of y and was assigned not change even when updated beyond the value of one variable., Resolved,0
