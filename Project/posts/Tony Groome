Saturday September 7th 2013 5:10 pm -04:00,Good point! Im using Windows 8. I downloaded Python 3.3.2 and ran it. It runs like a command prompt - very basic. I can find Idle does it come too or is it a separate download?, Unresolved,0

Sunday September 22nd 2013 7:20 pm -04:00,I keep on getting 22/24. Finally I have figured out where the problem is. It is in the insert_sequence part. I got my code to work out exactly the asked problem. But the test uses a longer code than mine and so mine does not work. Does anybody know how to find the midpoint in a string and return it. I tried     s = len(dna1)/2-1    return dna1[s:] + dna2 + dna1[:s]only to be told that I cant use s ie there must be a number in there. I have hit a wall here. I cant find the answer in the lectures at all....., Unresolved,1
Monday September 23rd 2013 3:02 am -04:00,Thats what I thought too. I used the midpoint based on the midpoing of AAGG and it worked. But when I submitted it it came back with an error there. They tested it with a 8 digits and it failed then as my midpoint was after 2 characters. , Unresolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 10:26 am -04:00,I did get the example they gave and got it to work. It has 6 digits like AABBCC. I got the AT to go in the middle so it returned AABATBCC. But when they test it they used an 8 digit code like AABBCCDD and mine didnt work. So only 22 out of 24. :(, Unresolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 11:22 am -04:00,Thank you all for your help. I re-read the question again. Man alive I was way off. Just uploaded my new code (which doesnt work!) and got 24/24. When I tested in Idle it says that is cant slice at index s - the index must be an integer. Still dont really get it but at least it passed...., Unresolved,1
