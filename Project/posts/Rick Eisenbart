Wednesday August 28th 2013 11:48 am -04:00,To view and edit hotkeys within IDLE:go to the pulldown menus at the top of your screen click IDLE -> preferencesa new window opens where you will see a keys tabin the keys tab you can view existing/default hotkeys or even set-up your own.These steps are for a Mac but I assume its very similar in Windows., Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:09 pm -04:00,Call it my lack of imagination but Im wondering when Id ever want to use triple quote strings. I understand it prints each bit on a separate line. Could anyone provide an example of where/how this might be useful?, Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:18 pm -04:00,Thanks. I see another example in the very next video lecture. This would be a lot easier than using  all the time., Resolved,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 1:27 pm -04:00,While I seem to generally understand whats going on in this video (and the course in general) Im having a hard time with memorizing the terminology. Even back to week 1 when we were learning about memory addresses and values the terminology has been hard to really understand. Am I worrying too much about the differences between memory addresses & values call stacks and frames and assignment statements and expressions? Or are these really critical distinctions that Id better learn quickly?, Resolved,1
Thursday September 5th 2013 1:52 pm -04:00,Thank you both for your answers. Etienne: Thats a very nice offer!  The need for that depends on how much more terminology were going to need to learn. Considering how alien the terms have seemed so far if theres significantly more to come then yes a Glossary might be really useful!  , Resolved,1
Friday September 20th 2013 6:00 pm -04:00,Im having the same problem and unable to solve it using whats been provided above. Heres what I have...def cap_song_repetition(playlist song):    (list of str str) -> NoneType    Make sure there are no more than 3 occurrences of song in playlist.        while playlist.count(song) > 3:        playlist.remove(playlist.index(song))    print(playlist)And in IDLE I have this...>>> playlist = [Lola Venus Lola Lola Let It Be Lola ABC Cecilia Lola Lola]>>> song = Lola>>> cap_song_repetition(playlist song)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#8> line 1 in <module>    cap_song_repetition(playlist song)  File /Users/rickeisenbart/Dropbox/Python/python coursera/deleteme.py line 67 in cap_song_repetition    playlist.remove(playlist.index(song))ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in listWhat am I doing wrong?, Resolved,1
Sunday September 22nd 2013 8:05 pm -04:00,At the top of the week 5 exercise it says These exercises are intended to get you to open IDLE and work on small pieces of code. If you have been copying/pasting/editing/running the code and trying out expressions in the Python shell then congrats youre doing the right thing!Although I struggled with this particular question a long time looking back on it now I think all we need to do is plug the 4 answers into the equation and see which one(s) work. Then study those that worked and didnt work to understand the code., Resolved,1
Friday September 20th 2013 10:12 am -04:00,I thought that was strange too. But the more I reviewed this the more it made sense. The insert method inserts an item at the current index position (-2 in this case is currently occupied by blue) and then it pushes anything that WAS at that index position to the right. So yeah it is confusing since now what we inserted at -2 is effectively at -3. It would seem to make more sense if the insert method was passed the index you wanted the item to reside at but the developers of the language probably had a reason to do it the way they did.>>> colours[taupe magenta hot pink blue auburn]>>> colours.insert(-2 brown)>>> colours[taupe magenta hot pink brown blue auburn], Unresolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 12:11 pm -04:00,Ive seen others approaches and realize my approach isnt quite right. Still I dont understand why the following leads to an infinite loop.sum = 0 i = int1while i <= int2:    addend =  int1 + 2    sum = sum + int1 + addend    i = addendprint (sum), Unresolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 12:31 pm -04:00,Heres the full function...def summation(int1 int2):    (int int) -> int    Return the sum of the even numbers from int1 through int2 inclusive    >>>summation(4 10)    28        sum = 0    i = int1    while i <= int2:        addend =  int1 + 2        sum = sum + int1 + addend        i = addend    print (sum), Unresolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 12:48 pm -04:00,Thank you Pradeep!With your suggestion I came up with an abbreviated version removing addend altogether. That seems to work (and no infinite loop).And Ashwini I didnt understand your suggestion at first. But now I completely understand it - you were absolutely right.Thank you both for your help!    , Unresolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 10:35 am -04:00,Alison and Pat Please continue asking your questions!  Ive come to the forum to ask several questions so far and Ive found the two of you have already asked the same question on more than this occasion. Youve saved me a bunch of time! Out of 35000 students you can be sure if something isnt clear to you it isnt clear to a LOT of others. And as for continuing after this course there is another class offered starting October 7th that will emphasize putting Python to use on small projects. It should be a great way to practice. From my experience studying JavaScript all the study in the world doesnt help when its time to sit down and actually program something on your own. The only thing that helps (me) is actually using what youve studied., Unresolved,2
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 3:33 pm -04:00,Having similar problems here:   words_filename = /path_to/wordlist1.txt   words_file = open(words_filename r)After completing that step in Visualizer I get the following...NameError: global name open is not defined, Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 4:33 pm -04:00,When I run my read_words() the shell returns a list of str with each of the 4 strings in wordlist1.txt. As I understand the assignment this is exactly what I should be seeing if Ive written the function properly. But when I submit the assignment I see ...student: test_a3.Test_01_ReadWords.test_01_return_typeERRORstudent: test_a3.Test_01_ReadWords.test_02_one_line_fileERRORstudent: test_a3.Test_01_ReadWords.test_03_multi_line_fileERRORSo apparently Im misunderstanding the problem(?). Or is there some other way I should be testing this? , Unresolved,1
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 4:49 pm -04:00,:)Its been weeks since Ive had to do that! I forgot that help was available. Method Description:NoneMessage:ERROR: DisabledBuiltinErrorCalling the open built-in is not permitted.And I see that has been mentioned in other threads so Ill look there for a better understanding of what this message means.Thank you!, Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 5:35 pm -04:00,I seem to be going nowhere. Im not even sure that Im referring to the right file. The file provided is an xml file that references a text file on Amazon. I downloaded that text file and am referring to THAT (what I downloaded).

How do I refer to the filename without it being a string?  I removed the quotes around the file name and of course that led to an error. , Unresolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 7:26 pm -04:00,My latest attempt results in an endless loop. Ive been at this so long I cant think straight. Id take a break but this is the only day I have available to finish this.

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 8:26 pm -04:00,I got read_words to pass (finally). For anyone else that has spent an entire day struggling with this this post finally provided the help that I needed to complete this function.  It seems much of the info Ive read here in the forums is SERIOUSLY misleading. Apparently you DO need to open the file just not within the function., Unresolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 8:19 am -04:00,Hello AnaI would love to be more help. After struggling so long with this yesterday I know exactly how you feel. But I think my previous post gave all the help I can give without violating the rules of the class. Please just re-read my previous post carefully and follow the link provided in there. I suppose I may also be able to safely say that I didnt use for line in words option in my solution. Maybe there is another way to solve it using that option but I used a different option to read through the file.Rick, Unresolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 10:30 pm -04:00,This one had me wondering too. Credit our TA Adrian Kentleton for pointing out that in this fourth option found is being assigned a new boolean value during each iteration of the for loop.  , Unresolved,0
