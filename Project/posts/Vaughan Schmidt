Tuesday August 20th 2013 3:02 pm -04:00,This veers off your original question but somewhat related:One thing to remember is Python is loosely typed compared to other languages like Java that are strongly typed.  A variable in Python can change type as needed in the code - you dont have to pre-specify what type a variable will hold.  For example somewhere in your code you can haveresult = 7 + 1and the variable result will be an integer type (int)later in your code you can have a line result = 7.1 + 1.1 and when that statement is evaluated the variable result will now be a float type.This should be covered in future lectures but people with experience in strongly typed languages may take some getting used to the flexibility this gives Python and you cant always assume you know the type of a variable without checking., Resolved,1
