Friday September 13th 2013 7:43 pm -04:00,The assignment description gives great directions on how to get started with this function. I created a boolean variable and a variable that held valid letters of a DNA sequence. Then I used if / else statements to return the appropriate boolean value based on whether the sequence was valid., Unresolved,0

Saturday September 14th 2013 12:36 pm -04:00,You code prints the string True or False for each character in the sequence. You have the right idea with:valid = (ACTG)The parenthesis are not necessary though.Instead of printing True or False your code needs to return a boolean value True or False. I suggest reading through Etiennes pseudocode above., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 10:14 am -04:00,Im a bit confused with the error message I get after submitting my code. First off Ill submit the code I have so that you may give feedback.def get_compliment(nucleotide):     (str) -> str    Returns the compliment of the specified nucleotide. Must use a capital letter.    >>>get_compliment(A)    T    >>>get_compliment(C)    G            [~ep]def get_complimentary_sequence(sequence):     (str) -> str    Returns the complimentary sequence. Capital letters must be used.    >>>get_complimentary_sequence(AT)    TA    >>>get_complimentary_sequence(TCGGCAT)    AGCCGTA        [~ep]This code works fine in IDLE; the output is correct. Why would the grader give me an error? Do you see any problems in the programs logic? Should my get_compliment() function look like this?def get_compliment(nucleotide):     (str) -> str    Returns the compliment of the specified nucleotide. Must use a capital letter.    >>>get_compliment(A)    T    >>>get_compliment(C)    G            [~ep]Should there be an else that returns ERROR or some other string to let the user know an incorrect nucleotide has been used?Thanks in advance for the feedback., Unresolved,0
