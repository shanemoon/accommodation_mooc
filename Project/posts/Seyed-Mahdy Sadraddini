Monday September 16th 2013 9:11 pm -04:00,Im not sure if I understand this: when numbering the indexes on zymurgy z is index 0 but i = 0 represents the empty string  . Can you please explain how could this be? , Unresolved,2
Friday September 20th 2013 7:40 am -04:00,Thank you for explaining but why would s[0] produce a different result than s[0:0]? Would that be because one is indexing and the other slicing? I guess thats it. Slicing is different than indexing., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 12:21 pm -04:00,Im not sure why None is returned when the line print(increment_items(values 2))is executed. Is it because we dont have any return or print statement within the body of the function? If so then it makes sense., Resolved,2
Wednesday September 25th 2013 8:12 am -04:00,Im a  bit confused about some code towards the end of the lecture for write:...>>> to_file.write(Copy)5>>> to_file.write(contents)540...He did not explain why he wrote >>> to_file.write(contents) or whether the returned value of contents contains the word Copy. I mean to ask We have 545 characters in the new to_file right? , Resolved,1
