Wednesday September 11th 2013 6:20 am -04:00,Tsy In the function time_to_utc the first parameter is the time zone and times zones are just integers and are not floats i.e. there is no time zone 1.5 there are only time zones 01 2 3 .... and their negatives. To my understanding time zones reflect the difference in full hours from UTC+0. Could that help?Bye Fred, Resolved,0
