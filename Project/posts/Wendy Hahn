Thursday September 26th 2013 1:09 pm -04:00,I have run my program and it seems to work correctly but I submit it and get these errors:student: test_a3.Test_02_ReadBoard.test_02_square_symmetric_boardFAILUREstudent: test_a3.Test_02_ReadBoard.test_03_rectangular_assymetric_boardFAILUREstudent: test_a3.Test_02_ReadBoard.test_03_square_assymetric_boardFAILURE, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 1:10 pm -04:00,I have even printed out the results of the Read_Board code and it looks correct., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 1:14 pm -04:00,It works with the files that were given as well.wordlist1.txt (a sample words list file)board1.txt (a sample board file)a3_driver.py  (a complete file that calls your functions and drives the game)And it compiles correctly.  I am at a loss.  I am not sure what a square assymetric board is either.  I am going to try to make new wordlist and board text files to see if this helps., Resolved,0

Thursday September 26th 2013 3:47 pm -04:00,Yes those are my results.  I will work on making up new files to check that it is generic enough.  I thought I made it generic enough but it sounds like I need crazy tables that are not rectangular or square.   So I will work on that tonight.  I think I am almost there just want to make sure that it is working correctly., Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 8:53 am -04:00,I worked on the program again last night and made several different txt files with crazy tables and then words that were not in the tables and a table with only one character etc.  They all worked.  So I am confused at what should be done at this point.  I am doing a for loop.  For the column length I find the maximum column length and then use that in my function.  It seems to be working.  Is there another corner case that I should consider?  I keep getting the same results that are stated above even though I made several different tables with different column numbers and row numbers which all work.  If anyone has suggestions please let me know.  I am at a loss.   , Resolved,1
