Wednesday August 28th 2013 1:00 pm -04:00,you need to write a function like convert_to_celsius(usa_city_temprature(seattle)...what this does is: first it finds temprature of seattle in farenheit and then it is converted to celsius using convert_to_celsius function, Unresolved,1

Wednesday September 4th 2013 7:00 pm -04:00,in such cases you always refer it as module.funtion.....recall the  videos where you to had find square root of a number...the way that was done it:import mathmath.sqrt(8)i hope this helps u in understanding., Resolved,2
Thursday September 5th 2013 1:16 pm -04:00,No they want the factorial of 8 not any other number.if u look at video to find sqrt of no:Sqrt of 4 is 2. Output shd be 2.First u need to import math module.Math module has many functions like tansinsqrt  factorial etc.U need to import the function as math.sqrt(4)... o/p wil be 2, Resolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 6:33 pm -04:00,The question here is not of time management..Its about the difficulty level. As the weeks are progressing the lectures are become more difficult. For beginners like me  we need time to understand the lectures first and then go to the exercises and assignments..the goal is not just to finish exercise and assignment; its to understand concepts clearly first and then do the exercises. Everyone dont have the same pace., Unresolved,2
