Friday September 6th 2013 7:54 am -04:00,Let me try to help you.You function receives 2 arguments: 2 numbers that express some timestamps in seconds. You are required to compute the difference between those timestamps also in seconds (so you are lucky enough not to worry about measure units at least at this step). Youre right the answer is very simple.Hope my explanation gets you to the correct solution., Resolved,1
