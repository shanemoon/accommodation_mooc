Sunday August 18th 2013 10:34 pm -04:00,In Python 2.x.x if you  type 3 / 2 = Youll get 1.But in Python 3.x.x if you 3 /2 = Youll get a floating point number (an accurate number Id say)So if you want to stick to Python 2.x.x (not recommended in my opinion) you have to type 3.0 / 2 and so on.Youll hit some hard rocks later on since Python 2 and 3 differ.I suggest you take the time and install the recommended stuff from here (https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/wiki/view?page=Resources), Resolved,5

Sunday August 18th 2013 10:49 pm -04:00,As Devin pointed out youll get to that part soon enough.Dont rush things. Also in my opinion installing the stuff on your PC will help you understand some extra things. The problems youll face during the installation are worthy going through since you may also face them in future work and so on. Learning more now is doing better later :P, Resolved,0

Monday August 19th 2013 10:37 pm -04:00,Ord is a really cool function if you always wondered how to do a specific symbol you may see somewhere on the internet.So for example I open http://unicode-table.com/en/Do you see the wall of characters there?So if you click on a character you see the unicode number. Thats what Pythons function ord does.ord(character) and you get the unicode number.For if I do ord(ڄ) I get 1668 which is the unicode numberBUT!How can you create this characters you may wonder? Aha! Geeky stuff incoming - you hold the LEFT ALT key and type the numbers USING ONLY THE NUMPAD NUMBER KEYS!Voila thats all :), Resolved,5

Sunday August 25th 2013 3:15 pm -04:00,Well you debug it.You type it without quotations - you see an error.You try with quotations - it works.Most of the functions need to be tried at least once so you fail but know how to use them properly afterwards.P.S the description needs to be better (of that given function)edit: I assume that you have already used help to read the documentation about the function., Resolved,2
Saturday August 31st 2013 10:28 pm -04:00,For anyone saying that you dont need to call the to_24_hour_clock function to complete the 6th step - you are right.You can complete it without it but its the quality of the code were aiming for.Its inefficient to neglect a function that can save you time writting code. Topic is covered in Week 2 - Function reuse (https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/lecture/30), Unresolved,2
Saturday August 31st 2013 10:31 pm -04:00,I wrote this from my experience with the assignment. I think itll be of help to you since after you finish some functions you understand what to do in the other ones. Heres how (in my opinion) you should go through the functions. The standard way is kind of harderhttps://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1025, Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 10:34 pm -04:00,Also to understand what the errors mean read this (https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=941#post-5964)If I may give some hints - get_hours can be solved easier by using the to_24_hour_clock functionBut get_minutes and get_seconds cant be solved within one line of return statement.Some more thoughts of mine here -> https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1025, Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 6:01 pm -04:00,!Im assuming that youve already read the instructions at least 2 times and understood the type contracts and examples.Start with seconds_difference hours_difference as theyre the easiest.Dont forget what you learned from Week 1 - Python as a Calculator ! Before writting the return statement ALWAYS do the expression manually outside the function call.Or you can write it in a notebook (but why when we have a notebook in python which can solve expressions too?)Now look at to_24_hour_clock. Understand the idea behind it. Head to the more easier (in my opinion) - time_to_utc and time_from_utcAgain do simple math expressions with the given examples. See where your function fails. Think of it as a clock. You should get it now.The harder ones (imo):get_hours get_minutes get_seconds and to_float_hours.Save to_float_hours for last.Go for get_hours get_minutes get_secondsAgain do simple math expressions within python with the given examples and think of some more too.You should be able to do get_hours as the other functions with only a return statement.But I myself couldnt complete get_minutes and get_seconds like that.Dont limit yourself to only one return statement. Think outside the box but within the 2 given functions.Youll figure it outAnd for last - to_float_hours should be a cake after you do the other functionsI hope this helps for anyone wholl bother reading everything. I tried to make it easier to read., Unresolved,6
Saturday August 31st 2013 10:18 pm -04:00,Sorry for the late response!Heres how I handled the a1.py file.I downloaded it right click -> edit with IDLE and from there I just save it often when Im changing something.I submit the file from the Assignments page (https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/assignment/index)and I upload is as a Code Submission.You saved the file as the same name - a1.py ( and py only not .py.txt!) - make sure you have the file extentions always shown (in windows)., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 12:56 pm -04:00,Anyone reading the front page? lolQuoting:Assignment 1: scoring 42/41Thanks to your feedback we realized that we were missing an Assignment 1 test case. We decided to add it but we didnt want to penalize anyone for our mistake. To address that we left the mark for Assignment 1 out of 41. It is now possible to get 42/41.
