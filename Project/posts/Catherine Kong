Monday August 19th 2013 11:07 am -04:00,Hi Marcus Im from Toronto Canada.I use Windows but am currently at work and havent had a chance to install Python.  I read this in another thread:If you want to access the IDLE Click Start -> All Programs -> Click the Python 3.3 Folder -> IDLE (Python GUI)Faster Way: Start -> Type Python in the text box below the All Programs - > Click IDLE (Python GUI)IDLE is not accessible in C:\Python33\ But it is accessible through start menu. Pin it in the taskbar to save more time.Good luck.  Ill give it a try when I get home.,None,1
