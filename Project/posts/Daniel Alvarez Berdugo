Friday August 23rd 2013 6:20 am -04:00,Hi thereI have learned some time ago the basis of C language and I wonder which are the pros and cons between Python and C. I would also like to know if similarly as with C Python programs can be written on .txt format and then be compilated with IDLE (which would be helpful if I had to write a program somewhere I dont have IDLE installed).Thanks!, Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 4:00 pm -04:00,I was practicing what we learned this week with a function capable of asking the user which is the DNA sequence. It would be part of a bigger program but by now it doesnt need an argument as I only want the function to ask and save the answer (and print it in a sentence to check if it worked). But python doesnt allow me to run that function and if I set an argument which isnt used later the function doesnt work. By now my solution has been this:def DNA(number):        seq = input(Set the DNA sequence)        void = number        return print(Your sequence is seq)which worked well but I wonder if theres any way to avoid giving an argument to the function.(please dont take into account that I didnt follow the funciont developing receipt), Resolved,0

Tuesday August 27th 2013 3:28 am -04:00,I think we havent been taught how to split a string into its parts (letters) or manipulating the string content so I find it hard to transform a text letter by letter. Anyway Ill gladly do it as soon as we get that knowledge! Thanks for the challenge,None,0
