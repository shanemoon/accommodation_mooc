But when I press to open the IDLE (GUI) it opens the Python shellthat has a name  7K 3.2.3. Python Shell but on videos I see that the name should be plane IDLE.I did not pay much attention before I noticed that the function call dir ( _builtins_) mentioned in the video  Buil-in Functions throws an error:>>> dir(_builtins_)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#25> line 1 in <module>    dir(_builtins_)NameError: name _builtins_ is not definedWhy does this happen? Do I have the wrong version?Also when I go to  edit - undo to change something I have written wrong it does not undo anything.....Help please!!!!, Resolved,0
