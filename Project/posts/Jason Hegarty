Sunday September 22nd 2013 8:17 am -04:00,My code is checking out fine on all my tests in idle but I am losing marks and I dont really understand the reasons as seen below:I could post my code but I fear it might be right and therefore against the T&Cs. Help appreciated., Resolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 8:16 pm -04:00,If I changed the variable message to:message = Happy 27th!and then run the code the result is 38 which is kind of putting me off trying to understand the code in the for loop.Is it just incrementing both numbers by 1 and by luck it turns out OK because if you add 1 to 2 you get 3 % 10 = 3 and if you add 1 to 9 you get 10 % 10 = 0.Because in my variable above you would first add 1 to 2 (3 % 10 = 3) and then add 1 to 7(8 % 10 = 8) which leaves 38. So whilst this works conveniently for the question in hand its not doing my understanding any good and it threw me for a while unless Im missing something here?, Unresolved,0

Select Week 4 if it isnt already expanded and then select Submit. Now you have two choices in the pop up window. Select the first option Code Submission and click browse. Find the file you have been working on called a2 unless you have renamed it and then click Open. Finally Click Submit., Unresolved,0
