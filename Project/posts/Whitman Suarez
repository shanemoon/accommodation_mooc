Thursday September 5th 2013 11:44 pm -04:00,Hello Im new to programming and this error is driving me crazy. After running the module of the function get_hours I keep getting the error: unsupported operand type(s) for //: function and int. What am I doing wrong? I have checked the spelling and everything seems to be ok. Please help!, Resolved,1
Friday September 6th 2013 6:59 am -04:00,Thanks for your answer José I am not using the words function or int. Here is my function:def get_hours (seconds):     (int)->int    Return the number of hours that have elapsed since midnight as seen on a 24-hour clock.     >>> get_hours (4800)    1    >>> get_hours (7200)    2    >>> get_hours (9528)    2    >>> get_hours (12521)    3    >>> get_hours (140)    0        return (get_hours //2)%24Here is the error Im getting: get_hours (12521)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#119> line 1 in <module>    get_hours (12521)  File /Users/WHITI/Desktop/Learn to program/assignment 1.py line 103 in get_hours    return (get_hours //2)%24TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for //: function and int, Resolved,0
