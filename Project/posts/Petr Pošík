Thursday September 5th 2013 5:51 am -04:00,Dear staff and allPEP 257 (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257) is a document describing the official suggestion what structure and contents Python docstrings should have. The suggestion for the first line of a docstring says that it shall contain a one line summary of the function purpose not its contract (input and output types).Let me point it out it is a suggestion not a rule. Yet I believe that this convention is broadly accepted in the  Python world. Moreover many standard documentation tools like docutils make use of this first docstring line and I believe they expect a short description of the function purpose rather than the function contract there.So my questions are:- What were your reasons when you decided to break this convention and suggest something different to the students of this course in your function design recipe? Why you actually think that your approach is better?- Can you list some broadly used Python packages that have their docstrings structured as in your function design recipe i.e. having the contract on the first docstring line?Thanks a lot Petr, Unresolved,0
