Monday September 2nd 2013 9:35 pm -04:00,The last sentence of the lecture was this:so what this example shows is that not only can call functions from within function definitions as we did in the semi-perimeter example but we can also pass function calls as arguments to functions since function calls are themselves expressions.Correct the above sentence if it is incorrect.This was a loaded sentence.First can we clarify:1) expression2) arguments3) parameters, Unresolved,0

Friday September 6th 2013 10:02 am -04:00,Why does step 2 require you to submit code? My project is incomplete? Wont I get a bad score??Once you have tried all the example calls and are happy with your function go to the Assignments page and submit your code. To do this click the Submit button and select your code under code submission. Ignore the additional submission part of the screen. Click Submit. This will send your program to our testing program which will call each of the A1 functions and test whether they are producing the correct values, Unresolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 11:18 am -04:00,at 3:27 of the first video in week 3 the lecturer says The current stack frame was created during (the second instances of minutes). Wasnt the current stack frame created in the first group of code? the video makes it unclear about which lines are being executed vs which lines are being discussed. I thought the convert_to_minutes stack frame was referencing the top part of the code no?, Unresolved,0
