Tuesday August 27th 2013 9:44 am -04:00,A triangle can have a length of side of 3 or 4.89789 so it can be an int or a float- so number was used to indicate that either an int or a float could be passed to the function. As far as I can recall in the quiz we were looking at the number of vowels or consonants in a string.Â  Since the number of these can only be an int type int was the correct data type to use (cannot have 8.3 vowels for example).Does this help?, Resolved,1
