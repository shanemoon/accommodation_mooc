Wednesday September 4th 2013 1:12 pm -04:00,Hi all I was having trouble with my version of idle in that every time I opened a second window the program would freeze up. I reasoned that maybe I had the wrong version of idle and deleted and tried to re-download it. Now I have no idle and cant seem to download it. Any recommendations or links for a download? Im on a mac version 10.6.8., Unresolved,0
