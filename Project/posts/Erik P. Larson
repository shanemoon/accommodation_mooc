Sunday September 8th 2013 5:08 pm -04:00,Im really stuck on this concept and cant figure it out.  Please help....Consider this code:def sum(number1 number2):    print(number1 + number2)result = sum(1 3)new_result = result + 1What is the outcome of executing the code above? - I have a hard time understanding why new_result does not equal 5 and instead results in an error.j- Likewise if I wanted Python to calculate it correctly to equal 5 what would be the proper commands instead???This seems that it should be basic but I appear to be missing some clear point.  Thanks for your help!!!!!, Unresolved,0
