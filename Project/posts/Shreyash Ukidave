Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:34 pm -04:00,Hello   I am getting the same reply back from server when I submit my code. I also do get False when I test my function with invalid capital letter. I see it is some problem on the other side and not us.   I am also getting a zero length error for the same function.But when I test my function with empty string   I get False as I would expect., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 4:13 pm -04:00,Hello Don   I got rid of zero length error by passing True if the string is empty. That was counter-intuitive but who cares! My code works. Thanks for your comment.   I am still getting invalid capital letter error. After your comment I am now comparing the given string with ATGCatgc instead of ATGC. So this should pass true if I input either A or a. Is this what you meant?, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 4:38 pm -04:00,Got it! I have to wait for half an hour before I submit again but I am sure this time there wont be any errors.Thanks a bunch for your comments., Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 3:44 pm -04:00,Try as Tom saidif num > 0:   return Falseelse:   return True, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 4:20 pm -04:00,Have you tried pasting your program in python tutor and walking through it? In my case I programmed it using the first method mentioned in the assignment. I kept getting the error. Then I changed to second method where you initiate a variable counter at the start of program to zero and whenever you find invalid sequence increment the variable counter by 1. Check for counter > 0 at the end of program. That should be it., Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 4:52 pm -04:00,Stop thinking about it. Sometimes in real life expectations from a program are vague and this is an example of the same., Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 3:54 pm -04:00,We find string s2 in s1 by s1.find(s2). That would by default give us the first occurrence of s2 in s1. The question wants to search for the index of second occurrence.So at least we can safely assume that now we have to pass two arguments to the function str.find. Something like s1.find(s2index). But the index here is a variable and it depends upon the index of first occurrence of s2 in s1.So try finding index of first occurrence using find function add 1 in it and pass it as index for second call to function find above.  , Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 17th 2013 4:46 pm -04:00,In order to answer your question about how to setup a loop:You can set num = starting point of sum (here 1523) and sum = 0.Write the code exactly as you worked out the problem in your head. At the start of loop check whether num < 10504 (we want to include 10503). If it is then add num to variable sum and increment num by 2. This should help a little.   , Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 17th 2013 5:38 pm -04:00,sum_even = 0num = 1523# while or if loop (missing code here) :sum_even = sum_even + numnum = num + 2print(sum_even)See if this helps. sum_even = sum(num+2) is not the proper way to loop through the odd numbers., Unresolved,4
Wednesday September 18th 2013 1:18 pm -04:00,i in sum(range.....) is not correct use. sum would give you one number after it is executed. How would you loop i through one number and secondly it is counter-intuitive.correct use i in range(....), Unresolved,1
Monday September 30th 2013 10:19 am -04:00,Are you high? I am a new programmer too and I have never seen such wonderful teachers like Jen and Paul in my life. If you want to criticize it is OK but this is not the language dude.Look at this way.They are full time teachers but still investing hundreds of hours in building the course materialrecording lecturesanswering questions and signing certificates in the endfor FREE.Is it not good enough?Even a stupid app on smartphones sometimes charge you $ 0.99.,None,4
Monday September 30th 2013 5:49 pm -04:00,Dear Shannon I welcome your criticism.Sorry from the bottom of my heart if I misrepresented my professional standing and misled others. You are correct in saying I have MATLAB experience. But if you read my profile carefully then you should have also seen me mentioning I rarely used MATLAB in my work. You forgot to mention this fact. Anyways frankly I have not programmed in last three years and this has made me forget most of my programming knowledge. Hence I referred to myself as a beginner. In the end I agree with you for misleading others. I did not want to discourage others and I am sorry. I truly feel that I am a novice. Second thing is this LTP course is my first CS course on Coursera MOOC or on CS for that matter. I have never completed any other CS course before. Enrolling in a course and completing it are two different things and I have been enrolling in may courses and dropping or not paying attention to most of them. If only Coursera could provide you with my course records. Anyways I apologize again for my actions. In the end just remember that even if we disagree we are students learning the same class. So dont give up and come back to this forum again and again. There are so many great people on this forum wanting to help others. I wish you the best for finals.,None,4
Friday September 27th 2013 12:58 pm -04:00,Same thing happened to me. I have spent 8+ number of hours on this assignment.I had read_board(board_file) nightmares. It took so much of my time and eventually I did in 3 lines of code with only one loop.So I felt good about myself.This is really hard assignment by far and I hope the exam would be simpler.Juggling these courses and working full time is very hard.I wish good luck to all who stuck up with this course so far.A few days and it will be all over guys!!!  , Unresolved,1
Friday September 27th 2013 5:29 pm -04:00,Yes I would like to ask the same question. It seems to me that you must be having good programming experience. Not only that you must be coding very frequently.In my case though I have programming exp in MATLAB I did not use it for last three years which made me forget most things about programming.Slowly getting back on track., Unresolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 5:36 pm -04:00,Yes the docstring did not really describe the purpose of the function.It was confusing. Most people on the forum have the same complaint.At last you are done.Cheers!!! , Unresolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 12:45 pm -04:00,Your assumption that program for finding words in a row should work for column too is WRONG.In the given list we have two rows and 4 columns [[A N T T] [X S O B]]. So when you increment index i in a loop the range will be different. I hope this helps a bit., Resolved,2
Friday September 27th 2013 3:24 pm -04:00,What do you mean? Can you please elaborate a bit?, Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 1:05 pm -04:00,What a relief!!! I feel like I have to party tonight for working so hard on this assignment and finally cracking it. Oops I forgot that its Friday. All the more reason to party.....I found that in read_board(board_file) function I was using line.rfind() and it was giving me errors.I changed it line.rstrip() and all good.Thought that somebody might be in the same boat., Resolved,7
Friday September 27th 2013 3:22 pm -04:00,Matti is correct in pointing out the mistake. Try len(board[0]) for indexing, Resolved,2
Friday September 27th 2013 8:55 pm -04:00,I see that the output is wrong. For example look at the list[0] element [E F J A J C O W S S ]. Do you see that the last element in this list is . Why is it like that? It should be      [E F J A J C O W S S]., Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 5:34 pm -04:00,@ Todd < 2 hours. You sure gave me inferiority complex. Do you still want to optimize the code?Really???@ Matti What is p(complexity) is n2n^2, Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 10:30 pm -04:00,I have n1 complexity in my code if I count one for loop as n1. But in a deeper sense I am using range in my code and it is a kind of loop.It is just that the looping is done by the range function automatically. For example range(1100)means increment 1 by 1 until 99.So it is just like a for loop.Sorry if it does not make sense :) I am not an expert programmer.... By the way I wrote read_board(board_file) in just 5 lines including def and return statements., Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 5:55 pm -04:00,Thought it would be something like that. Your answer made it clear. Got it boss!!!, Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 3:16 pm -04:00,This means your code is not generic enough to pass in the evaluation test.By the way do not use open statements in your code.Also try using line.rstrip instead of line.rfind. For me that was the cause of error.Please come back and post questions on this forum.It seems that there are a lot of experts commenting and helping on this forum.You might get an answer., Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 10:11 am -04:00,Final exam will be posted later in the course. There is still one more assignment to go and I think one or two more exercises.Please see the logistics page.To give you a heads up: Final exam will be a timed exam of 3 hours duration., Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 10:23 am -04:00,Correction. There is only one more exercise remaining and final exam will be posted today.See Anonymouss response above., Resolved,0
