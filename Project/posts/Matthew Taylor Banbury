This includes your str.replace() method.But thats OK since the problem is actually simpler than your making it out to be. Without using replace you can complete the function in just a few lines if you call your get_complement function.Think of this way: start with an empty string then for every nucleotide in your DNA sequence call the get_complement function. Make sure to return your new (now non-empty) string and not your original DNA parameter., Resolved,0

Its among the most registered courses on Coursera so no doubt theres a huge demand for it.They may be tweaking it or thinking about when its best to schedule. But Im just hoping as well. :),None,0
