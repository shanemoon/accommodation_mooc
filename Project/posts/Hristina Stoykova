Monday September 2nd 2013 6:23 am -04:00,Привет и от мен сега ви видях та ще ви се натреса :) @baconi в този курс няма 50 % penalty за late submission (иначе да в други го има) така че до 9ти можете да го правите без да се притеснявате от наказания. - Хриси,None,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 5:13 pm -04:00,I absolutely agree with Joshua about this:It would actually be nice if Autograder had an option to cancel submissions as I have five duplicate submissions waiting in the queue. Being able to cancel some of them might help Autograder catch up., Resolved,4
Monday September 2nd 2013 5:51 am -04:00,It means that your results are (way) different than what was expected -> you are not calculating it right. Why dont you try a more simple approach? For instance if I am to calculate someones time in my head (say I need to call them) what Id do usually is just subtract my offset from the current time to get the UTC and then add their offset to UTC. Once you get there you just need to convert the value to the 24 hr format. They have explained how in the to-do sheet. Tip: try to use ONLY stuff that was taught in the videos :) Youll make your life waaay easier ;) , Unresolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 8:00 pm -04:00,It means your calculations for get_hours is wrong. The test case result is 105 the expected one is 9.Keep in mind that the prerequisite is to get the hours since midnight i.e. the value for get_hours  *must* be between 0 and 23 always. 105 is way larger than that. You need to make a function that would do that here is a test you can use to check your function:get_hours(380000) (it should return 9) Tip: in the to-do list they told you to use the to_24_hour_clock function :-) , Unresolved,0

Sunday September 29th 2013 8:53 pm -04:00,Hey guys.. I got stuck on the num_words_on_board function and I thought someone might be able to help... I am wondering how to put it since I do not want to breach the honor code but basically (I thought) I have figured out how to create the function all my tests return correct values but I keep getting this error:student: test_a3.Test_11_NumWordsOnBoard.test_02_normalMethod Description:NoneMessage:FAILURE: AssertionError7 != 13 : Wrong number of words found on board.I wont put my code since I think the actual code is correct perhaps one of the previous functions does not return the correct value... I really dont know but I am wondering if anyone knows how is this tested? Perhaps if I know the test query  I can figure out where to look for...Here is the output of some tests with my current code which turns out not to be correct: >>> num_words_on_board([[A N T T] [X S O B]] [ANT BOX SOB TO])3>>> num_words_on_board([[A N T T] [X S O B]] [ANT BOX SOB TO AX])4>>> num_words_on_board([[A N T T] [X S O B]] [ANT BOX SOB TO AX TT])5>>> num_words_on_board([[A N T T] [X S O B]] [ANT BOX SOB TO AX TT TB])6>>> num_words_on_board([[A N T T] [X S O B]] [ANT BOX SOB TO AX TT TB AS])6>>> num_words_on_board([[A N T T] [X S O B]] [ANT BOX SOB TO AX TT TB AS ATT])6>>> num_words_on_board([[A N T T] [X S O B]] [ANT BOX SOB TO AX TT TB AS ATT XOB])6>>> num_words_on_board([[A N T T] [X S O B]] [ANT BOX SOB TO AX TT TB AS ATT XOB BT])6>>> num_words_on_board([[A N T T] [X S O B]] [ANT BOX SOB TO AX TT TB AS ATT XOB BT NS])7>>> , Unresolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 11:16 am -04:00,I am guessing that you are looping over the board  using a range for either of the previous two functions (board_contains_word_in_column / board_contains_word_in_row).  One of these (or possibly both?) is out of range so the iteration stops at the error instead of returning false. If I am to guess check what range are you using for board_contains_word_in_row :) Test this function separately see if it works. , Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 11:37 am -04:00,My bad what I really meant is make_str_from_column - please excuse me. There is something tricky in the range there so I suspect its what its giving you out of range (I did have the same issue). P.S. Its a good idea to remove the code for make_str_from_row from the post above :) , Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 11:42 am -04:00,The previous code for make_str_from_row was fine (this is why I mentioned it was a good idea to remove it :) ). As I said I wrote row  but what I really meant was column. To simplify what I want to tell you: How are you counting the number of columns? :) , Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 11:59 am -04:00,Exactly :) When I try that I get:    for i in len(board[0]):TypeError: int object is not iterable, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 12:07 pm -04:00,To give you an idea for a different approach:1. You cannot iterate through integers.  Why not using while loop instead?2. For the example given (two rows 4 columns) - we expect to get a 2-letter word. So the loop must execute *twice*  or as many times as the number of *rows* 3. Our word must be formed out of the letter at column_index index on each row so you iterate through column_index in board[x] and board[y]Does that help? :) , Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 12:30 pm -04:00,The one you posted a few posts back? I have it in an email because I am subscribed to email updates.  I will re-post your initial post so you get an email about it but then Ill delete it. For the while loop: go back to the videos and see the examples they give you for while. Youll notice that they use a variable for the index that is set prior to the function much like word.  Use it :) , Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 10:03 am -04:00,Isam you need 70 % to pass the course and earn the certificate. Exercises and assignments are worth 75 % of the grade if done perfectly. This means that if you do all the work up to week 7 you hardly need the exam to pass whatsoever. Since the beginning I have thought of the exam as something that allows you to make up for imperfect exercise / assignment score. Now even more so since they made it clear in the announcement that it is not intended to be a learning experience. , Resolved,1
