Sunday September 15th 2013 6:23 am -04:00,can someone please tell why this code is wrong?s1.find(s2s1.find(s2)+1len(s1)), Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 1:27 pm -04:00,1. I agree with the len() being unnecessary. Realized it much later in the day. 2. The starting point for find()  is  s1.find(s2) + 1. Since 1 has been added it looks for s2 in the index immediately after the index where s2 is first found. I have checked it with all the examples and got a correct answer. So Maybe reason number 1 is why my answer was graded wrong.Anyways thanks for the help. :), Resolved,0
