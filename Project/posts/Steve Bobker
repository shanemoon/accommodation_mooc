Thursday August 29th 2013 9:47 pm -04:00,Im using the very same parameters for several days on and previous days that were accepted in my code for time_to_utc yet when I use them in my code for  time_from_utc they explicitly come back as failures. Frustrating beyond words., Unresolved,1

Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:41 pm -04:00,The problem summary:This aint a rocket science question and I easily figured the right answers (and was later verified by the question feedback). So I check and double check theyre still checked right before I submit and bingo they up as unchecked and wrong. This has happened at least twice. Im totally frustrated and Im going to just accept the score I have now., Unresolved,1
