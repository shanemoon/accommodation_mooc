Saturday September 28th 2013 8:01 am -04:00,Just wondering what should be the return format?[[E S A H A P J] [F D S E N M E] [J G R A S S P] [A K J N D N Q] [J S D D N F L] [C R U N C H Y] [O F S D N H N] [W D K J E E X] [S F L W O J D] [S F K A P E L]]Or [ESAHAPJEDSENMEmore]Please help me :), Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 8:10 am -04:00,I guess its from the last function read_board function. My read_board function returns this[[E S A H A P J] [F D S E N M E] [J G R A S S P] [A K J N D N Q] [J S D D N F L] [C R U N C H Y] [O F S D N H N] [W D K J E E X] [S F L W O J D] [S F K A P E L]]Is there anything wrong with my answer?

Sunday September 29th 2013 5:15 pm -04:00,Why dox =  for two times? you just need that in loopIts a good practice not to waste CPU,None,1
Sunday September 29th 2013 5:01 pm -04:00,Well i was just playing with python and wrote this simple functiondef count(x):    if x < 99999:        x+=1        return count(x)So basically i am calling the function in return over and over again until the condition fills So why i am having this error? More importantly What it stands for?Error is  File /usr/lib/python3.3/idlelib/PyShell.py line 1320 in write    return self.shell.write(s self.tags)RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object,None,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 12:44 pm -04:00,First this is not an infinite loop as it will return None when x < 99999And its just okey for small number like 99 something.Maybe there is a restriction in python?This was really just test code. I didnt meant to use it anywhere. Thats why i am naming what comes into mind first,None,0

Monday September 30th 2013 11:19 pm -04:00,Ok Let me explain why people use python 2.7At first this course was all about python3.3 so when i decide to create a website with python i pike Django Framework and Mysql server as back end and it said python3 does not have a mysql driver.The most popular networking library like Python Twisted does not have support for python 3.3 yet.So If we need to do something solid we can use python3 but when we take big projects or something that might contain 3rd party library they might not support that.Sorry for bad english.,None,0
