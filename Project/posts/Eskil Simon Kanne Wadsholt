Friday August 23rd 2013 7:52 am -04:00,Basically Anonymous is right. Here is my version of it:\frac{2}{-3}=-1+\frac{-1}{-3}\\ \quad\\ \frac{-2}{-3}=0+\frac{-2}{-3}\\ \quad\\ \frac{-2}{3}=-1+\frac{1}{3}\frac{2}{-3}=-1+\frac{-1}{-3}\\ \quad\\ \frac{-2}{-3}=0+\frac{-2}{-3}\\ \quad\\ \frac{-2}{3}=-1+\frac{1}{3}From the above it follows that:2//-3 = -12%-3 = -2-2//-3 = 0-2%-3 = -2-2//3 = -1-2%3 = 1You can say that a//b always yields the largest integer less than or equal to a/b. From this the remainder is uniquely determined., Resolved,1
