Sunday August 25th 2013 5:14 pm -04:00,Hello Ive downloaded QPython for my Nexus 7 Google tablet but I cant figure out how to use it. Ive posted this in the editor: def area(num1 num2):    return num1 * num2 / 2I click the run button (the arrow) and when I go back into the console and type area(3 4) I get an error. Can anyone tell me what I may be doing wrong? Thank you  --Aaron, Unresolved,0

Saturday September 14th 2013 8:15 pm -04:00,I want to terminate a program. I found something online but it doesnt work for some reason. Am I doing something wrong?import sysif (answer == n) or (answer == N):        sys.exit()Any thoughts much appreciated. ,None,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 8:47 pm -04:00,I tried that and no luck. It didnt terminate the program. But thanks.,None,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 8:52 pm -04:00,I am starting the program with >>> menu()That how I start the program. I dont think Im doing anything weird. It runs through the processes just fine. At the end Im basically asking the user if they want to go through the program again or if they want to quit.,None,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 8:59 pm -04:00,Not a silly question at all. My import sys is at the top of the program outside of all the def modules. And the sys.exit is in the proper block. I will play around with it more. ,None,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 9:01 pm -04:00,What happens when the answer comes up and the user types n is that the program does not terminate. It just restarts as if the user had typed y for yes. Weird.,None,0
