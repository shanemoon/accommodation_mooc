Tuesday August 20th 2013 5:04 pm -04:00,Well.I studied Laws (yes you could ask yourself what Im doing here :p). Python is my first approach to any language program. And I find it quite easy to understand and very useable. For me that I come from a degree that has nothing to do with programming and computer languages​​ I find more difficult to understand the teachers pronunciation than python itself: P.,None,8
