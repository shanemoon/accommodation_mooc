Monday August 19th 2013 6:23 am -04:00,HelloI was wondering if you are planning to offer the verified certificate for those students interested? I reckon it is a great step forward and gives a plus to the course. I have done a few courses already in Coursera with the verified statement of accomplishment and the diploma looks considerably better...also in regards of a potential employer it is much more appreciated a verified cert. Any comments welcome and thank you for offering this course.,None,14
