Wednesday October 2nd 2013 11:58 am -04:00,Also under the int function description string can contain not just digits but also an optional leading minus sign.Coming back to the float function description where it mentions that it accepts a string containing only digits and zero or one decimal points (possibly with a leading minus sign -) I would like to add that since zero is a digit the phrase digits and zero is redundant. I would suggest a string containing an optional leading minus sign at least one digit and an optional decimal point. as a possible correction., Resolved,0
