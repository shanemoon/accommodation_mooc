Monday August 19th 2013 2:54 pm -04:00,Hi StevenI use a Mac and I have installed an additional Tcl/Tk framework that I run in parallel. This has been successful for me and I have not experienced any problems but unfortunately I cant state whether or not this would present any problems for your installation.

Monday August 19th 2013 1:25 pm -04:00,If youre just starting out with Python and programming Id suggest sticking with IDLE for this course.  However if you already have some experience you could consider something like PyCharm http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/. PyCharm is commercial software but there is a 30-day evaluation.  Its not Mac specific.  There are a number of other editors and IDE options too but I dont know of anything that is specifically written for Mac and Python.My personal preference is to use Sublime http://www.sublimetext.com/  (which is a commercial text editor) but it isnt really an IDE., Resolved,2
Monday August 19th 2013 2:56 pm -04:00,Hi StevenI have now replied in your original thread.  Unfortunately I cant really help out as I dont run R so I cant comment on whether or not a parallel Tcl/Tk installation would present you with any difficulties.  I run two frameworks and havent experienced any difficulties but YMMV.RegardsByrne G, Resolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 2:13 pm -04:00,Hi JustinIm just wondering if perhaps you are misinterpreting the green checkmark on the feedback page?  If you have correctly left an entry blank you will see the green checkmark. For example for Question 10 you may have selected 2 of the 4 options as being valid and in the feedback you may see all 4 of those items have a green checkmark.  This means that you correctly selected the 2 valid options and you also correctly left the invalid options unselected.I hope this makes some sense.RegardsByrne G,None,7
Monday August 19th 2013 2:46 pm -04:00,Hi Connor  As a simplified explanation there is a mapping of numbers to characters. One example of this is ASCII (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters). The ord() function allows us to ask Python what number is associated with a character.  There is a reciprocal function called chr() that takes a number and gives us a character.For example:>>> ord(A)65>>> chr(65)A>>>Byrne G, Resolved,6
Wednesday August 21st 2013 7:46 am -04:00,Osawaru for Windows you would use Alt p for previous.  Its a bit confusing because on a Mac it is Ctrl p., Resolved,3
Wednesday August 21st 2013 7:27 am -04:00,AllRather than posting the actual question from the quizz try and use alternate examples to discuss the problem. Often there are examples in the video lectures or the lecture notes that you could use. It may sound silly but if you use the actual questions people are inclined to provide the answers and this ends up violating the Honour Code.As to the question of precision for the answer you shouldnt go wrong if you copy and paste the answer from IDLE.ThanksByrne G,None,2
Thursday August 22nd 2013 2:27 pm -04:00,Zhang - As you work through the course you will see that your score for the exercise or assignment will be displayed.

Wednesday August 21st 2013 7:16 am -04:00,HiYou may want to try and figure out how to obtain the latest version of Python for your computer as there are a few other differences between Python 2 and Python 3 that will become evident as you work through the course.  Most Linux platforms I have used in the past have provided access to recent versions of Python so perhaps it is a matter of finding Python 3 in your package manager?  Thats where I would start.Byrne G,None,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 8:57 am -04:00,It may be helpful to read http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html and http://floating-point-gui.de/. Using round() doesnt necessarily solve the problem depending on how and when it is used. The Python tutorial mentions using round() for post-rounding. As I mentioned in another thread understanding the binary representation of numbers is not really important for this course. Its good to understand that this problem exists and to know that it can result in subtle errors.Byrne G, Resolved,2
Tuesday August 20th 2013 8:48 am -04:00,Youre right that this is related to floating point numbers. I believe the problem is referred to as the Representation Error. You may want to have a read of http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html and http://floating-point-gui.de/ as they provide some additional information. Its not something you need to understand for this course but may be of interest as you progress and need to deal with precise numbers.Byrne G, Resolved,2
Tuesday August 20th 2013 1:31 pm -04:00,David is correct there is no real limit on the length of a variable name I have seen people testing in excess of 50000 characters.  I have no idea why you would ever want such a long variable name.  The length is dependant on the memory available to Python. For practical programming purposes you dont need to worry about the length of your variable names in Python.  Pick something that is descriptive but keep it reasonable as you may end up typing it a lot ;-)As for the maximum storage size again that is dependant on the environment. In simple terms Pythons memory limits are determined by how much physical ram and virtual memory disk space your computer and operating system have available. You certainly shouldnt be bumping in to any of these limitations during this course., Resolved,1
Tuesday August 20th 2013 1:46 pm -04:00,Hi Afzaal Gourabchanda is correct but it will depend on whether youre using Windows / Linux or Mac in Windows (and I think Linux) it is Alt + p for previous and Alt + n for next.  In Mac it is usually Ctrl + p and Ctrl + n.Byrne G, Resolved,1
Tuesday August 20th 2013 1:39 pm -04:00,There are a number of ways to implement version control for your code and git (or GitHub) is certainly one such option.My personal recommendation is that you stick to learning the basics of programming first.  Once youre up and running and need the ability to keep track of changes that youre making to code youre writing or you need to maintain different versions of the code that would be a good time to explore tools like git.Having said that if you feel youre up for the challenge you could easily locate a git tutorial on the Internet and give it a go.  If you do decide to make use of a public site like GitHub (as opposed to creating a local git repository on your computer) be sure to look at the permissions. I doubt you want to be sharing your homework with the world ;-), Unresolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 10:59 am -04:00,@Nissi - Are you using Python 2? The input() function in Python 2 works differently to the input() function in Ptyhon 3., Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 11:05 am -04:00,Thomas - Each function stands on its own.  You need to write the get_hours() get_minutes() and get_seconds() functions.  You dont need to worry about how theyre used you just need to make sure they do their job.  The a1_gui.py file exercises all the different functions youre writing.  You can think about the assignment as writing the engine that is used by the a1_gui.py code., Resolved,1
Saturday August 31st 2013 9:05 am -04:00,Indeed Tom - that is what the to_24_hour_clock() function does ;-), Unresolved,1
Saturday August 31st 2013 9:30 am -04:00,Ramon - Try to break the problem down using the examples and the information provided as part of the assignment. We are given the hours minutes and seconds and we need to somehow combine them. What do we know? We are given the number of hours so we just have to add the minutes and seconds to that number. There is a precondition that tells us the minutes will be less than 60 so never making more hours and seconds will always be less than 60 so never making more minutes. All of this means that we already know the number of hours we just have to figure out how to deal with the fractions (or parts of the hour).What do we know about time? We know that 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour. A quarter (1/4) in float is 0.25. That looks a lot like the first example. If we want a quarter of an hour perhaps we could express it as something like 15/60 (60 minutes in an hour)?You can apply the same thinking to seconds.To get your final result you want to think about what mathematical operator allows your to add your results together., Unresolved,1
Saturday August 31st 2013 8:41 am -04:00,The code as displayed above works just fine. It may be that youre mixing single and double quotes? I would recommend that you use the # symbol to comment out single lines of code. So something like:def fun(x):     (int) -> int        return an int        #return x%100    return x//100, Resolved,2
Saturday August 31st 2013 8:54 am -04:00,I have been a little reluctant to post a comment in this thread as it violates the Honour Code. Remember were not supposed to post the code used in an assignment even if it isnt working. Whilst this may make asking questions a little more difficult you may find that trying to explain the problem without actually posting the code will help you clarify the problem in your mind. Also there is no problem if you give an example of code that is not used in the assignment but essentially does the same thing.In answer to the problem above if youre getting the answers from get_hours() as you have shown above I suspect youre not using Python 3.x. In Python 3.x your code would result in a float and our signature states we are supposed to return an int., Resolved,2
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 1:48 pm -04:00,Lyamina - Your code is returning a float but should be returning an int. Also you need to remember to use the to_24_hour_clock() function as per the assignment.  Hopefully that should get you back on track. :-), Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 8:34 am -04:00,Using automated testing such as doctest is covered in more detail in the next course LTP: Crafting Quality Code.  If youre already familiar with these techniques there is no harm in using them. If youre new to programming and reading this thread youre welcome to try out the code above but I would suggest sticking with what you have learned in this course as trying to figure out some of these more advanced features may just complicate things for you., Resolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 10:34 am -04:00,Yakov - Python doesnt expect that. The precondition is something the programmer has decided to use.  In this case the precondition was provided as part of the assignment for the reasons Jonathan. I suspect that explaining modulo arithmetic with negative numbers was felt to be outside the scope of the course.  Most people are able to grasp the concept of modulo with positive numbers., Unresolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 2:09 pm -04:00,The grader is expecting a value of 9 when it calls get_hours() with the test input but instead receives the value 105. If we take 105 % 24 we get 9. Thats what happens when we call the to_24_hour_clock() function as required by the assignment., Resolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 10:44 am -04:00,Sudhanshu - Have you tried testing your time_to_utc() function with all of the examples provided for that function as part of the assignment?  Do you get the correct results for all of those tests?, Resolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 11:20 am -04:00,Sudhanshu - The examples are already included as part of the assignment so I would be surprised if that was causing any problems.  You may want to be sure that you have thought about the examples to be sure you arent missing any.  For example have you tried something like:>>> time_to_utc(+1 0.0)23.0, Resolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 10:47 am -04:00,Gregory - Submit your a1_full.py code using the code submission button. Just ignore the additional submission button as it is not used for this course.  Its there because it is part of the Coursera platform and is used by other courses., Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 2:01 pm -04:00,Technically this is incorrect as per the assignment. I have highlighted this to the staff. The assignment specifically states that the get_hours() function should use the to_24_hour_clock() function and the result should be a value between 0 and 23. This is a case where the test code doesnt adhere to the specification ;-).Update: Ignore the above - I got myself mixed up., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 5:39 am -04:00,Alan - Youre correct.  When I first looked at the result of the assertions from the autograder I assumed that the result from the function being tested was on the left hand side and the expected value on the right. I had omitted the to_24_hour_clock() call for get_hours() in my initial test run; later I updated my local copy of the code but forgot to submit it to the grader.  So I thought the grader was expecting 105 instead of 9.  Hope that makes sense and I apologise for any confusion I created.In summary - make sure you remember to call to_24_hour_clock() as per the assignment. ;-), Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 1:58 pm -04:00,If you were looking to test the pre-condition there are several solutions.  Python is pretty cool in that it will let you do something like this:>>> x = 10>>> 0 <= x <= 60TrueThats fun for another time though :-), Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 1:55 pm -04:00,Camoya - The input is in seconds as per the assignment:>>> get_hours(3800)1>>> get_minutes(3800)3>>> get_seconds(3800)20You need to write each of the three functions. They are independent. I would also recommend trying some other tests like say less than an hour one minute and just less than one minute and perhaps also something larger like more than 24 hours. Use these tests for each function., Unresolved,0
