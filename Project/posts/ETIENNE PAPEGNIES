This is why the unary - has higher precedence than the binary -.Were entering the second case of that grammar snippet because the first token is still - and whats on its left must be another u_expr.The second time around the only choice is the first one because none of the other possible first tokens are on the input stream.And the rule becomes...power ::=  primary [** u_expr]Theres a few more steps involved but the point is the expression is valid Python syntax.  Side note: when there is no way to process the input stream using the Python grammar thats when a SyntaxError is raised.For those that didnt run away and that are still interested I recommend Pr.

Tuesday August 20th 2013 3:43 am -04:00,Yeah it is a question of memory but I dont think it relates to the garbage collector.  Instead I believe that the id() function looks up the address of the object referred to by the variable because the object can exist even if it is not assigned to a variable.  Heres an interesting snippet to illustrate:  >>> hex(id(4))0x8bb9e0>>> x = 4>>> hex(id(x))0x8bb9e0>>> hex(id(4))0x8bb9e0, Resolved,6

However if you are very motivated you can submit a bug report:  Start creating a new thread in this section of the forum.At the top of the new thread check the box to signal a bug report.Choose a concise but meaningful title.Summarize the problem in the summary section.In the Steps to reproduce section start by listing the characteristics of your environment to the best of your knowledge in order:   -  Device designation (iPad model x)  -  Operating System designation (whatever version of Mac OS its running.) and version of the operating system  -  Web browser you tried and their versions.  -  Version of the Flash player.  -  Specific link to the Video on which you experienced the bug.Then explain what you did just before reaching the bug what your tried and whatever result you got.I dont think you have to bother with a screenshot in that particular case but if you can take one it wont do any harm.  Post your thread and the report should be sent up the food chain., Unresolved,0

Thursday August 22nd 2013 6:06 am -04:00,In any case do not be afraid to ask a questionPeople in the course staff are a really nice bunch and there is a boatload of students here that made it their mission in life to help others.   What follow is only some suggestions on how to ask for help. Step 1 - Ask a RoBoT      (Search the forum)Common practice on the Internet.With over 65 000 students (and counting) registered for this course it is likely that someone ran into the same problem so take a few minutes to search the forums using keywords and Check the FAQ.Step 2 - Choose where to askIf you dont want to ask in English or if you feel like you can express your problem better in your native tongueConsider asking in a language-specific study group.The Arabic Study Group. اذا احتجتم للمساعدة، تعالوا واسألوا هناThe Dutch Study Group. Als je hulp nodig hebt vraag het hier.The Spanish Study Group. Si necesitas ayuda preguntanos aquí.The German Study Group. Wenn Ihr Hilfe braucht fragt uns hier.The Chinese Study Group. 如果有任何問題歡迎到這裡發問！-- 如果有任何问题欢迎到这里发问！The French-Speaking Study group. Si vous avez besoin daide venez demander ici !The Russian Study Group. Если вам нужна помощь задавайте свои вопросы здесь.The Italian Study Group. Se vi serve aiuto chiedete qui!The Brazilian Study Group. Se você precisa de ajuda venha e nós pergunte aqui.  If you decide to ask in English choose the right sub-forum.       The forums here have a lot of sections and sub-sections each with its own purpose.  If you prefer Facebook You can also get help on the official Facebook Study Group.Step 3 - Watch out for the special case of the [Platform Problem]If you can determine that your problem is of such nature (because its obvious because nobody could help you because someone told you so because you tried everything else etc...) then you dont have a lot of choices left but if you are very motivated you can submit a bug report.Here is a real live example of a problem another student encountered in which I explain in detail the process of submitting such a report. Step 4 - Choose a meaningful title that will also help competent people notice the threadIt is generally better to start a new thread rather than posting in an existing one that way your question will be more visible than if you post in a slightly related thread with a lot of comments.If you have a coding problem then a lot of students will be able to help you but if your issue appears to be related to your environment (Example: you have trouble installing IDLE) then mentioning the Operating System you use (Windows OSX Linux flavor etc) is a good idea.I am totally useless when it comes to Apple computers or Windows 8. Step 5 - Describe the issue in detailsGive some context explain how you got there.If the problem is related to a video lecture say which one.If it is a programming issue then give some code using code blocks.If youre not sure where in the code is the error give all your code using a pastebin-type website such as the Debian Pastebin.  Take care of not breaching the Honor Code when the coding problem concerns the graded Exercises / Assignments.  Its OK to post code that you know dont workIts not OK to post code that worksYou can also think about posting links to screen captures of the bug in action using a picture hosting site such as imm.io  Step 6 - Post your question and check for an answer after 5 minutesThe course forum is a very active place.Sometime you will get an answer or a request for additional details literally in seconds. Step 7 - [The end]: post to say if / when your problem is solvedThat way people who helped you can move on to helping others.If you started a new thread to post your question please mark it as resolved.[Notice: this is a work in progress]  , Pinned Approved,22

Wednesday September 4th 2013 7:51 am -04:00,If you are using IDLE there is no built-in way to clear the shell.  The closest would be to define a function like so:  def clear():    return  * 100To just output new lines until the previous text disappear.  If you are using a Terminal you can try CTRL + L or clear or cls under Windows, Pinned Approved,0

Thursday September 12th 2013 1:51 am -04:00,Yeah you cant have a return outside of a function body.  What you can do however is evaluate the function call:  >>> def sum(lhs rhs):...   return lhs + rhs... >>> n_1 = 6>>> n_2 = 7>>> sum(n_1 n_2)13Take a look at the course wiki.

Thursday August 22nd 2013 7:38 pm -04:00,Why do I get a SyntaxError when I try to define a function?Thats probably because you forgot to add a new empty line after you finished writing the function body.Here are the important points:>>> def f(x):          # <-- Dont forget the colon at the end!...     return x ** 2  # <-- Dont forget to indent this line with four spaces left of return!...                    # <-- Leave this line empty!>>> f(4)    # <-- Now you can call the function!16, Pinned Locked,0

Thursday September 5th 2013 11:16 am -04:00,Hello AgnieszkaSure Im gonna tell you why I would recommend Python over Java for an introductory programming course please keep in mind that this is my own personal opinion though not a concerted answer from the course staff.  1 - Python allows for quick experimentation and therefore is Fun.With a capital F.  Being an interpreted language you dont have to perform a compile step when you want to run a program so you can change your code and execute it right away.That reduces the chance of modifications to the code not being reflected at execution time I cant tell you how many times I forgot to recompile a Java or C++ program and didnt immediately understood what I did wrong.The fact that you can use it as a quick and dirty calculator is also most helpful when in the classroom. 2 - Python has a very rich standard library and is easy to useIt allows the user to do a great deal of things without always having to rely on third party libraries.It is also ideal to build quick and dirty tools that will make your life easier.I use it (amongst other things) to create the PDF versions of the in-video quizzes each week.I described some parts of the process here.  3 - Python removes the need for the user to constantly worry about resources managementMemory allocation is a very important thing to understand when youre a full blown CS major but for most users that just want to have fun writing small and non-critical programs this is an added layer of complexity that is not strictly necessary.  4 - Python is beautiful forces good programming habits onto beginners and the documentation process is supported by its designMy personal favorite.There is a lot of cool things in the Python syntax.That makes for easy-to-read code both for teachers evaluating homework and for students reading example code.The control of the logic flow is done through indentation and thats very useful I went into some details about that here.  Im sure theres a lot of other valid reasons to use Python but those are the main selling points for me and thats why yes without a doubt I would recommend Python over Java for an introductory course.

Tuesday August 27th 2013 7:27 pm -04:00,Michelle: I wouldnt say intuitive but when you know how the interpreter processes code it kind of make sense.  When it reaches a function definition the body as a whole is evaluated to create the function in memory.  So it does not go evaluating each lines one by one.  Check out this screenshot of the visualizer: http://i.imm.io/1gkSL.png  You can see the previous step that was executed marked by the blue arrow.  Cheers, Unresolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 12:52 am -04:00,May I ask why you guys are sticking to such an historical version of the Caesars Cipher?  It certainly made sense at the time because Mr. Caesar did not have a handy tool such as ord() at his disposal and the only ordered sequence he could use was the letter sequence but if you forget that limitation you can do something thats a little bit harder to decrypt and more fun too:  >>> def caesar_encrypt(msg key = 5):...     (str int)-> str... ...     Return an encrypted version of message msg using a caesar-like cipher with...     a shift dependant on the key and the length of the string.... ...

(str int)-> str... ...     Return an decrypted version of message msg using a caesar-like cipher with...     a reverse shift dependant on the key and the length of the string.... ...     Precondition: key is in the (arbitrary) range [O 255]... ...     ...     return .join([chr(ord(char) - key - len(msg) % key) for char in msg])... >>> scrambled = caesar_encrypt(This is a test! 255)>>> scrambledŢŶŷƁĮŷƁĮůĮƂųƁƂį>>> scrambled = caesar_encrypt(This is a test!! 255)>>> scrambled  # Notice how adding one character changes the shift.ţŷŸƂįŸƂįŰįƃŴƂƃİİ>>> caesar_decrypt(scrambled 255)This is a test!!Cheers,None,2
Saturday August 31st 2013 4:06 am -04:00,Lakka:  I agree that this is just a small step up in difficulty but youre not supposed to have access to the encryption code when you are trying to break the Cipher on someones communications.  Now picture the enemy soldier trying to decrypt Caesars message:  - Omg what in the seven hells are those weird looking charactersNow suppose said soldier has access to an antique version of ord() and know what those characters are.  Line one:  - Yeah I finally broke the cipher now all of the message will make sense!  Line two:  - Oh sh*t.,None,1
Saturday August 31st 2013 4:39 am -04:00,Hi Diane  Im not arguing with the choice of the exercise only with the fact that it sticks to the exact historical version of the Cipher.  It made sense at the time to restrict the range of the encryption mechanisms output to the range of inputed characters ([a-zA-Z]) but given that we are using a program to implement the shift Cipher it is actually not necessary.  If you take a look at the code I proposed youll see that it actually removes one layer of complexity.  Cheers,None,0

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 9:06 am -04:00,Im gonna try and come up with an acceptable response but I think that ultimately this would be better handled by an instructor.  There is actually some value to the concept of not concern[ing] yourself with how it does this.  In a lot of situations you wont be able to know such a thing and will have to use the tools at your disposal either way.  To illustrate my point Im gonna try and explain how the longer function would do it:  It would be a Python function that calls the len() built-in Python function twice and compares each calls with a comparison operator. It would then based on the result of that comparison return the string passed as argument that has the biggest length.  Please note that at the time of AKs posting we were still in Week 2 so in order to answer the how he would have had to introduce Week 3 concepts.  Now that was a rather short-to-explain example but in the future you will have to use tools to solve problems and you wont at all be able to know how they work.  During the second Week of the course I coded a crude tool in Python to help with producing the PDF versions of the in-video quizzes.  I did that because without the tool the process of generating said quizzes would have been extremely painful:  Take three screenshots for each question (question correct answer explanation)Manually cut each image so that only the interesting part of the screen would remain in the image.Create a new file to hold that cut version of each image.Name each new file in a sequential manner.Convert each cut file to PDFsGlue each of those PDF files together to produce the final PDF documentNow that I have the tool I can just take screenshots and run the tool to produce the final PDF.  To code that tool I used a Python module named PyPNG.  I had to use a number of functions from that module and the point of the exercise was to do less work not more.  So I consulted the module documentation for each function and did not concern myself with how they worked only with what they were supposed to do and how I was supposed to use them and build on their work.  That kind of scenario is as I understand it one of the main points of the concept of function reuse.  I think the whole point of the exercise is to help students figure out what information is important and what information they can safely ignore.I hope I managed to answer your question somewhat.  If I didnt please dont hold that against me and please keep in mind that the CTAs in this course are people who try and help however they can but were never actually trained for this., Resolved,2

Tuesday August 27th 2013 8:03 am -04:00,Hi  Basically everything in a logic block (Here that would be a function body) must have the same indentation. That means that after a def statement every line must be deported to the right by a constant number of space characters.  def dummy_function(lhs rhs):     <-- note how the dummy docstring is indented with four spaces?        # And here we can start to write code still with four space indent.    lhs += 2    rhs -= 4    output = str(lhs)    output += You can leave empty lines but not if you type your function in the shell!    output += str(rhs)    return 42# <-- And now that youre done with the function you can break the indentation., Unresolved,2

Saturday August 31st 2013 5:57 am -04:00,Shoguns!Thanks a lot for signing up!Following is the game plan Ive been thinking about for the Guild it is open to discussion so dont hesitate if you have other helpful ideas:Stuff you can do without having to write anything:1 - Upvote helpful posts you notice in the forums.An helpful post is one who guides the person asking a question to the answer while not introducing concepts he doesnt know yet.This will encourage helpers to help more.There is only a handful of reason why you would ever need to downvote anyone please be careful to not downvote people expressing their own point of view even if it does not help or totally misses the point.Stuff you can do that needs actual keyboard action:0 - Be careful not to breach the honor code when you answer a questionHint to the answer help the student reach it by himself. 1 - When you answer a question watch out for cases where people obviously never read this thread or are asking questions that are already answered in the FAQ.When you encounter such a case invite the person asking the question to take a look at those threads (try and be nice about it) and if he is asking about a specific FAQ item provide him with a link to that specific item. (You can link to individual posts / comments - the link is on the right of the posters id) This will help educate your fellow students on the best practice when asking for help and will reduce the probability that such questions from the same student appear in the weeks to come. 2 - If you know of a link to a specific thread where a question is discussed at length feel free to direct the student asking about that subject to that thread.3 - When you actually have to answer the question yourself format it nicely.Use code blocks for code or shell snippets use bold text for important words etc...4 - If you feel like it you can go back on your posts when you know they helped and sign those with a link to this thread.Example: Anon - The GuildThis will recursively help us recruit more members.Stuff you can do if you can come on the IRC channel:Drop me a line in private when needed. 1 - Hunt down FAQ items.We are currently late in setting up the Week 2 FAQ. Well start working on it but any help is welcomed. 2 - If you stumble upon Honor Code violations alert us so we can edit the posts.If Im not connected or afk you can alert nitish` or d4vey if you see them. The guidelines about posting code samples or attempted answers for the Exercises or Assignments are as follow:If someone posts an answer / code that he knows is right then thats a problem and you can alert us / notify the poster.If someone posts an answer / code that is wrong then thats not a problem.If someone posts an answer / code that he think is wrong but isnt thats a problem too and you can alert us / notify the poster.If someone after seeing a wrong answer posts some helpful advice without giving the answer such as Please be careful what operator you choose to use thats not a problem.If someone after seeing a wrong answer posts something like Just replace / with // and thats right then thats a problem too and you should either alert us or notify the poster.    I know this is a fuzzy line but please use your best judgment. , Approved,2

Thursday August 29th 2013 11:42 pm -04:00,The -1 % 24 = 23 bit is due to the mathematical properties of the modulo operator actually this is one thing to watch for when you start a new programming language: not all language use the same definition of modulo operator. I once lost an hour while coding a bit of C# because of that.  But anyway the other thing to know is that this is heavily used in Video Games.  Consider an Asteroids kind of old retro video game: you are commanding an alien space battleship in a screen that is 24 positions wide.  When you are at position 23 right before colliding with the right side of the screen your position on the screen is 23 % 24 = 23 .  When you collide with the screen your position is now 24 % 24 = 0: you reappear on the left side of the screen.  When you are at position 0 on a collision course with the left side of the screen your position is 0 % 24 = 0.  And then again when you go through the left side of the screen your position is  -1 % 24 = 23: you reappear on the right side of the screen.  Cheers, Resolved,4

Saturday August 31st 2013 6:59 pm -04:00,I see a lot of people struggling with Assignment 1 and pasting the raw feedback summary over and over again.   This post is to explain that the feedback is not only there to tell you that something failed but also what failed and how. If you dont see well enough the screenshots copy the image address by right clicking and choosing the correct option in the contextual menu then paste it in the address bar in a new tab. I made some modifications to my personal a1.py file in order to make it fail some tests and illustrate my point please excuse my poor editing skills:   To get to the Feedback click on the view button:   Youre gonna see the awful stuff that people enjoy posting on the forums because they think that it contains meaningful information.However heres the kicker: thats not all there is to it!On that page please direct your attention to the mid-summaries link.   And then click it. This will show you a more detailed version of the feedback.When considering the next screenshot please note that every function that you are supposed to write is assigned a series of tests referred to as test_<function name>.   Here you can see that two of my functions failed: seconds_difference and hours_difference.I only introduced one error in my code. Im gonna let you speculate but at that point its pretty fair to assume that one function failing caused the other one to fail.This is specific to the code I wrote for the Assignment and it does not mean that if your function seconds_diff fails your function hours_diff should fail too. Now hey were well on our way to having a clue about what went wrong!Now is the time to get slammed in the face by the overwhelming amount of informations you get when clicking the Details link on the top right corner of the table. Brace yourself: this is rough!   As you can see for each function a number of different tests is executed.In that particular case it seems that all the tests in the docstrings are run and then some. Now you can get even more information by clicking on the FAILURE link on the right of each test report.Youll get something like this:   This gives you somewhat human-readable information about what was tested and what went wrong.  For the story I introduced a random * 0.999 in my code to derail the calculation that the grader performed.  The value on the right 12.1654etc.. is what my function returned and the value on the left is what was expected.Now if you followed the Handouts recommendations and submitted your completed steps as you went you should be able to get a grip on whats going on or at least where the problem is.   I hope this will be useful to some of you.I will update this post with a second example in a while.Cheers   , Pinned Resolved,22

Sunday September 1st 2013 10:02 am -04:00,Hello Renée   Python uses indentation to delimit logic blocks inside a program.A function definition is such a logic block:   Everything after the functions header that is part of the function must be indented by the exact same amount of whitespaces characters.When you start writing a logic block you end the first line of that block with a colon :.Every statement coming after a colon and inside the logic block must be properly indented to the right.If the immediately following statement is not indented the interpreter will raise a SyntaxError.   When you break the level of indentation it tells the Python interpreter that the following instructions are not part of the previous logic block.Because of that youll sometime see other SyntaxErrors when you broke the indentation too soon due to the fact that some statements such as a return statement cannot appear outside of the logic block.   In about a day when Week 3 goes live another kind of logic block will be introduced: the if statement.In the same way we indent the content of function definitions well have to indent the content of the if statement.   In a lot of other programing languages logic blocks are defined by opening and closing sequences so the indentation of their content is usually not mandatory.Because its not mandatory people can feel free to indent in a very irregular manner and that tends to produce code that is very hard to read.

Monday September 2nd 2013 4:11 pm -04:00,I dont mean to be rude but you do realize were an international crowd of students with no connection whatsoever with UofT that we dont get paid for doing this and that the course staff cannot possibly monitor each of our keystrokes from over our shoulders - mainly because were in other countries in different timezones?  Also and Im quoting coursera staff on this one: The student who originally posted the question may also resolve the thread.,None,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 4:50 pm -04:00,Hello  Its good that youre playing around with Python and please keep on doing that. :)  Technically your code does not stick perfectly to the design recipe theres three things Id like to point out:  The actual return type of your function is NoneType because it prints the result without returning it.Because of the previous point the docstrings description is a bit inacurate. You dont need to enclose your colon separators in parenthesis but you can add spaces after each comma to enhance readability.  Have you watched the Week 3 videos yet?  If you did then you can now rewrite the function so that it sticks closer to what you wanted in the first place. :), Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 5:03 pm -04:00,This kind of things can happen when you introduce a Syntax error somewhere in your file.  Ive tested that a while ago: removing a colon at the end of a function header caused the very same kind of feedback with only 8 test attempted (one per function thats probably the test that checks if the function can be called) and all tests failed., Resolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 9:20 pm -04:00,Step 4 is to_float_hours.  Are you calling the function inside its own body?  If you are then the function keeps on calling itself ad infinitum and at some point Python runs out of memory.  That would explain a RuntimeError: max recursion depth exceeded.  Cheers, Unresolved,0

Thursday September 5th 2013 9:38 pm -04:00,The quiz is not wrong but I get why it might be confusing:  When the function is called at the moment of the assignment the sum of the numbers is printed.  It is not however returned. The fact that the sum appears on the screen is merely a side-effect.  Because the value is not returned the function exits and automatically returns None.  If youre still not convinced check this out:  >>> def sum(number1 number2):...     print(number1 + number2)... >>> result = sum(1 3)4>>> print(result)None>>> Cheers, Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:27 pm -04:00,When the line return g(y) is executed y is first evaluated and replaced with its value: the object 1. Then the function g is called with 1 as an argument and inside of the function call the parameter x is made to point to the object  1. In python the memory management model is designed so that existing objects are not automatically duplicated but reused when possible whereas in some other language each parameter would end up in a truly local variable. At the point in the execution where your screenshot was taken both y (Edit: the y in the frame of the function f) and x are pointing to the same object value 1. If you step forward in the execution youll see that the object 1 cease to exist when the f() function call returns because the value is not needed anymore., Unresolved,2

Wednesday September 4th 2013 7:26 am -04:00,Gerard When you use the Run Module functionality of IDLE its pretty much the same thing as pasting the code into the shell except it does a quick Syntax check on the file first. Theres a modified version of the import statement that produces a similar result in Python: from module import * Howeverdoing this is sometimes considered bad practice.  If you have previously defined a function and the module contains a function with the same name the function you had will be silently replaced by the function in module which can trigger unexpected behavior., Unresolved,0

Thursday September 5th 2013 3:43 pm -04:00,Hey sorry about that. The way you choose to implement the functions is entirely up to you each function can actually be written so as to not depend on any other functions. It is recommended to use to_24_hour_clock because it makes you practice function reuse at least once in the Assignment but again its up to you. Both ways to go about it have their own advantages: If you go with function reuse youll minimize the risk of introducing bugs in your code. If you go with independent functions troubleshooting using the autograder will be easier. As for get_hours get_minutes and get_seconds it is important to understand that the values those functions should return are restricted in range much like it would be on a digital clock: That would be 15 hours 5 minutes 40 seconds. You would never see on that clock something like 25 hours 70 minutes 61 seconds., Unresolved,3
Thursday September 5th 2013 1:09 am -04:00,Stephen actually thats not quite how it would go: Nothing inside a function body can be executed after the program flow has reached a return statement. A function always returns one single value this is true in any programming language that I know of not only Python. This is the reason why the elif statements are not necessary here. Actually the last if statement himself is not necessary you could write:    if scheduled_time == estimated_time:        return on time    if scheduled_time < estimated_time:        return delayed    return earlyAnd the function would behave in exactly the same way. Theres only three different cases were concerned about regarding the values of scheduled_time and estimated_time. If we ever reach the second return statement its because the first condition was not met or else the function would have exited at the moment it would have reached the first return statement. And for the same reason if we ever reach the third return statement it would mean that the first two conditions checked were not met. Does that make sense?  Cheers, Resolved,1

Saturday September 7th 2013 3:39 pm -04:00,Hi Bradley  Using Python visualizer off-line is possible but just so you know it is quite painful to set up.  Basically you have to install a web server that will serve local http requests and run the Visualizer inside it.  Theres also a less painful way to set up a visualizer with Google app engine but it uses Python 2 not Python 3.  Still it can still be useful to watch frames unfold on the stack but if you rely on it for arithmetic you better make this your bible.  Anyway if you feel motivated take a look here.  Now about the path thing Im not a Windows expert but maybe you can find an answer here.  If I were in your shoes Id try either this or the following statements in the shell:  import syssys.path.append(C:\\path\o\he\\folder)(Note the escaped (doubled) backslashes.)  I hope thatll do the trick.  Cheers,None,0

Saturday September 7th 2013 10:20 pm -04:00,Hey Anon What you can do is try this:Heres an example call for the function seconds_difference in Step 2:>>> seconds_difference(3600.0 1800.0)-1800.0This is the example call thats written inside the documentation string in the file a1.pyDo this in IDLE:>>> time_1 = 3600.0>>> time_2 = 1800.0Now you have two variables each with a value and its the same values they would have in the function during the example call.Then go back to the Week 1 videos about Python as a calculator and the videos about Variables. You can try and combining those variables into expressions using the arithmetic operators from the Python as a calculator video. Example:>>> time_1 + time_25400.0time_1 + time_2 is an expression and it is evaluated when you press enter as the value 5400.0. Now theres other operators available including the minus - operator. Try and use it instead of plus and see what result you get. Try different orders for the variables with different operators like time_2 + time_1 and so on. When you get an expression that evaluates to -1800.0 (the result of the function call in the example) then youll most likely have the correct expression for the function. Then go back to your a1.py file and write a return statement for the function right under the documentation string and with the same indentation as the documentation string (so 4 spaces character on the left of the keyword return). On the right of the keyword return leave a space then write the expression you found that evaluates to -1800.0. Then save the file using either the menu or CTRL + S. Next either use Run -> Run module or copy all the code for the function seconds_difference by selecting it then using CTRL + C and paste it into IDLE using CTRL + V then hit enter until you get back the prompt >>>.  Once thats done go back to your file and copy an example call then paste it into IDLE and check that it returns the correct value according to the Examples.  Do that for each example call in the documentation string.  When thats done and you got the right value each time go to the Assignment page click the Submit button on the bottom-right. Using the dialog that opens select your file a1.py and make sure that is the correct file that you modified. Then click Open and then Submit again. When thats done go back to the Assignment page and click the View button at the bottom right and you should see that your function seconds_difference passed some tests and got you some points. Then go back to your code and re-read the instructions about the function from the handout read again the function description from the documentation string and understand why the code you wrote make sense.  Then you should be able to go to Step 3., Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 4:08 am -04:00,Alright you open a1.py in IDLE and then:   Tackle the very first function definition in the file: seconds_differenceWhat I recommend you do is type this in IDLE: >>> time_1 = 3600.0>>> time_2 = 1800.0Now you have two variables with the same name as the parameters in the function.Play around in IDLE using the first week material especially from the Python as a calculator and Variables videos.Use those variables and arithmetic operators to write in expressions and evaluate them.Try different operators and different orders for the variables.  When one of the expression evaluates to -1800.0 you will have most likely found the exact expression that you need to write in your return statement.So add that body to the function then try and run the module in IDLE.If it runs fine and you see the RESTART status message try and copy the examples from the docstring of the function into the IDLE shell and see if they produce the expected results.   When you have successfully tried all the examples in the docstring go to the assignment page and upload your modified file (make sure youre really uploading the file you worked on people forget that a lot.)   With chance you should see that your function has passed some tests and earned you some points.Then you will be on track to go on to Step 3.Can you try that?Cheers  , Resolved,1

Ive tested the code in IDLE and I get the correct result every time!You are most likely using the print(...) function instead of the return statement to show the results of your functions.If the feedback says something that more or less None is not <whatever> then go back to your code and replace every print(...) function call with the appropriate return statements./!\ Emergency Update /!\Houston we have a problem.Pythons Syntax is so nice that people tend to use words instead of symbols thinking its gonna work out fine.For a few days now Ive noticed an outbreak of people using the is operator in their code.The is operator is the object identity operator it most likely does NOT behave the way you think it does.If you use it in your code and you cant figure out why your functions are failing this is probably the reason. Use the equality == operator instead., Pinned Approved Unresolved,18

Thursday September 12th 2013 11:07 am -04:00,Why does the autograder says All=8; Errors=8; Failures=0; Successes=0; Warnings=0?

Friday September 13th 2013 1:55 pm -04:00,This exercise is about function reuse and how to apply a function to every characters in a string. A good example of a very similar use case is the implementation of the encryption step of a shift cipher. A shift cipher works by replacing each character in the input string by the character obtained if the first character is shifted by a number of places. So for example A becomes B with a shift of 1. A shift cipher with a constant shift key of 1 could be implemented like this: def shift_one(char):     (str) -> str    Returns the character obtained by shifting char one time to the right.    >>> shift_one(A)    B    >>> shift_one(B)    C        # Get the number corresponding to the character add 1 to it    #  and returns the character corresponding to that new number.    return chr(ord(char) + 1)def get_encrypted_message(message):     (str) -> str    Returns an encrypted version of message obtained by shifting every    character one place to the right.    >>> get_encrypted_message(AB)    BC    >>> get_encrypted_message(BC)    CD        output =                            # Initialize the accumulator variable.    for char in message:                  # For every character in message...        output = output + shift_one(char)     # ...add the shifted char to output.    return output                         # When every char was added return the result.>>> get_encrypted_message(This is a test!)Uijt!jt!b!uftuNow for the get_complementary_sequence code instead of the shift_one function you would be using the get_complementary function., Resolved,5

Wednesday September 25th 2013 10:42 pm -04:00,Well when Python evaluates a boolean expression the last thing evaluated becomes the value of that expression. >>> True and TT>>> False and TFalse>>> False or TTRecall the rules for evaluating boolean expressions:     From left to right    and binds more strongly than or. (It has higher precedence)                If the left hand side of an and expression is False the right hand side is not evaluated    The right hand side of an or expression is only evaluated if the left hand side is False.And theres an extra rule: if a string shows up in place of a boolean value its considered False if its the empty string  and True if its not.So in the code nuc == A and T  if the left hand side is True because its an and operator the right hand side is evaluated its value is T so it becomes the value for the expression and because what followsis the right hand side of an or expression its not evaluated. However if nuc is not equal to A then the whole and expression evaluates to False and the right hand side of the or expressionis then evaluated etc..., Pinned Approved Resolved,2
