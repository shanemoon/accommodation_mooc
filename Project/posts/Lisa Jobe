Friday September 27th 2013 12:56 pm -04:00,I got a 0/37 after uploading. Granted Im not finished I just wanted to see how I was doing so far. As for what I have done so far everything worked in the shell. Ive done up to and including make_str_from_column if thats relevant. This is the only feedback the autograder gave me?  Method Description:SomeOtherKindOfProblemMessage:ERROR: ExceptionYou probably have a function that calls itself either directly or indirectly.Im just not sure how to interpret this. Any suggestions for where to look in my code? , Unresolved,1
Friday September 27th 2013 10:08 pm -04:00,No I dont have any while loops just for loops and I thought the body of the for loop exits once it reaches the end of the string (or whatever parameter it is looping through). Thanks though. , Unresolved,0
