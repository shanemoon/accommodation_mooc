Sunday September 8th 2013 7:14 pm -04:00,It has been really amazing so far with the course. I am a Math enthusiast. So far with the course I understand that it really helps to use programming for Math problems as an application. But I am wondering if we could actually do and practice higher(University) level Math using programming alone? I mean to actually study Math via programming(instead of writing it down on a paper). In that way one can improve Math and coding skills at the same time. I suppose I could also ask a similar question for learning Physics?Thank you. VJ.,None,1
Sunday September 8th 2013 7:28 pm -04:00,I am sorry if I didnt make myself clear. But my question was not about whether I need to know Math to do programming. I know that we need some knowledge of Math to do programming(Math is a path to programming). But can I actually study higher level Math using programming that is my question? In other words can Programming(as a tool) be a path to Math?,None,0
Monday September 9th 2013 12:27 pm -04:00,Hey Alan Thank you take your time to post a detailed view. I am not that young. I am 30. I am actually doing my PhD in Molecular Biology but all I do there is physical work. There is no real thought process involved let alone use of imagination. I am not very satisfied with my work. I have always been fond of Math and Physics(wanted to study them since school) but due to circumstances I chose to do Medicine and continuing now with a PhD. I am in a transition stage right now. I started studying Math on my own and attending few online courses as well. Hence my question about programming and Math as I am relatively new to this area. I am actually finding myself more and more involved. I might as well discontinue my PhD and start full time with Math and Physics. I havent made the decision and I am doing all this on my free-time. I just finished revising all my school Math and going to start with University level Math. In this whole thread I seem to find that I actually cannot use programming as the only tool to study Math and Physics rather there are some places where I can use the power of programming to execute my problems in a much efficient way. For example in the coursera course: Introductory Physics we used python to understand Newtons 2nd law it was way better than doing all of that using paper and pen. Hence I opted for this course in programming. Now I am trying to figure out to what extent programming can actually help me understand Math and Physics. I observe that to have a conceptual understanding of Math and Physics I must study them as they are. To state a real example I actually understood boolean logical operators(and or if statements which I am studying in Intro to Math thinking) better after joining this course.  Hence I was wondering if programming could actually help me learn Math and what are the ways that I could use programming to learn Math. Any suggestions are welcome. :) :) :) ,None,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:08 am -04:00,Hello allI had asked similar question in calculus one course forum theyve given me information about  Project Euler and Sage. They also agreed with the fact that I can indeed use programming as a platform to study maths. Though I feel at the beginning one needs to know both programming and some level of Math to begin with that means I might not be able to use programming as a stand-alone platform rather as an additional(a very good additional) platform. Especially Project Euler seems to be exciting as it tries to combine programming and mathematical problems to get deeper insights. In addition to the amazing links given in this forum I think I now have a pretty good overview and decent information to start working on it. And some more: Mathematica seems to be cool as well Book:  Calculus&Mathematica by Davis Porta UhlAnother brief example: I have also been doing Intro to Math. Philosophy course and they were using  not(p) or qquite often and I never was able to understand it. After Alains example above on Implication statement I actually seem to understand it better. It kinda gave me that something which was missing.  Thank you all you guys are just great!! PS: I deleted an earlier post of mine which seemed irrelevant to the topic of discussion. ,None,0

Monday September 9th 2013 7:19 am -04:00,Thank you very much for awesome links!! I really appreciate it. This seems quite close to what I have been thinking. I guess doing maths with hand has become obsolete. We need to switch to better tools to do better work. ,None,0

Friday September 13th 2013 1:47 pm -04:00,I cant stop wondering since Paul told us about importance of how programming is crucial air plane control and hence our life depends on it.Can anyone tell me if there has been a major mishap due to a single wrong code? Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.-Oscar Wilde Thank you.  ,None,0
Monday September 16th 2013 11:30 pm -04:00,I actually did notice something interesting: When I deliberately took off the last indexing part like this:>>> s = brbrbrey>>> l = 0>>> while not (s[l] in aeiouAEIOU):	print(s[l]*6)I encountered it goes on forever:bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb  .  .  .  .  .Is there a way to stop it without actually closing the python? , Resolved,0

Tuesday September 17th 2013 9:30 pm -04:00,For the question 10: >>> a = [1 2 3]>>> b = a>>> # MISSING CODE HERE>>> print(a b)[1 A 3] [1 A 3]Which of the following code fragments(s) could be the missing code in the program above?This is one of the options: b[1] = ABa[1] = a[1][0]I used python and figured out the answer and it is one of the correct answers. But I really dont understand what this does:a[1] = a[1][0]Thank you. , Resolved,8

Thursday September 26th 2013 2:27 am -04:00,Thank you so much Tom!! You are awesome!! It seems I had used word in all the way from board_contains_word_in_row and I deleted all of it. It works like a ferrari now. , Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 11:37 am -04:00,you are asking for word but you are using a different index for calling that is i. So replace i with word. and word inside the board_contains_word to words. ie. words[word]. Probably they are going to delete both these comments as it contains the explicit answer., Resolved,1
Thursday September 26th 2013 5:47 pm -04:00,as far as I see it this code should work. But dont forget this function depends on few other functions so maybe check all those others again...., Resolved,0
