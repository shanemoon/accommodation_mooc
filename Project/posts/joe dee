Tuesday August 27th 2013 3:17 pm -04:00,The Wing IDE has both a free lite  version and a commercial version which is free for students if you can answer 3 easy questions.  That will give you a student license free for 6 months and it is a full featured IDE., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 3:39 pm -04:00,These questions are probably based on ignorance so bear with me:1)   I dont understand the purpose of the visualizer...it seems that we dont really need to know what the computer is doing in the background.  Im trying to learn to program and I dont really understand why knowing what the computer memory is doing is helpful toward the programming goal.  If I know x = 4+5 what does it matter where x is stored;  its out of my control and doesnt seem to me to make any difference.  Perhaps in advanced programming courses this may be helpful.  But in an introductory course?  2)  Way too much time spent writing function descriptions.  Every function Ive ever seen in real programs  are something like def f(ab): ...return(a+b)...I have never seen the types of explanations as outlined in this course.  Again shouldnt  this be a topic for an advanced class?   Right now in the beginning my main focus is learning to write a function that works and not highly motivated to write self help for the functions.Thanks in advance., Resolved,1
