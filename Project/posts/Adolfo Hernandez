Wednesday September 4th 2013 9:07 pm -04:00,Hi guys! This post was great for me because I could study all the stuff Ive learned so far my code is the following:def collatz(coll_num):    print (int(coll_num))    if coll_num == 1:        print (Done!)    elif coll_num%2 == 0:        coll_num = coll_num / 2        collatz(coll_num)    else:        coll_num = 3 * coll_num + 1        collatz(coll_num)I wanted to include a counter so I can display the total numbers contained in the chain at the end but I couldnt figure it out where to put my counter reset to zero when the function is called If you can give me a hint because Im lost. By the way I did this code just with stuff from the first 3 weeks!Great exercise THANKS!,None,3
Wednesday September 4th 2013 10:17 pm -04:00,I had it something like that but I wanted my counter reset within my function I wanted a way without adding another parameter but I couldnt find one and it ended like this:def collatz(coll_num counter):    print (int(coll_num))    if coll_num == 1:        print (Done! Total numbers displayed: counter + 1)    elif coll_num%2 == 0:        coll_num = coll_num / 2        counter = counter + 1        collatz(coll_num counter)     else:        coll_num = 3 * coll_num + 1        counter = counter + 1        collatz(coll_num counter)Of course as precondition counter would have to be 0.Thanks Tom!,None,0
