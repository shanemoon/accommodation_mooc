Thursday September 26th 2013 10:27 am -04:00,I got it right but Im not happy with the way. 1. In the shell it worked only with a Print command i.e. it printed each and every result till the end. 2. I was also able to get just the result using Return but only when I did so in a new function I created in a py file. 3. When I tried the same function I used in the PY file directly in the shell (not running the PY) I got an indention error that I couldnt solve. any Idea? The commands I used are here:1 - The PY file: (worked nicely)def total(startendjump):    total=0    for num in range(startendjump):        total=total+num    return total2. The shell that didnt work (without the PY)>>> total=0>>> for num in range(524105102):            total=total+num            return totalSyntaxError: return outside function3. The shell that worked (without the PY)>>>total=0>>>for num in range(524105102):            total = total + num            print(total), Resolved,2
