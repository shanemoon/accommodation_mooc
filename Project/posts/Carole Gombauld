Friday September 20th 2013 10:04 am -04:00,What happens in the initial code  is: In the first for loopYou go through every character of the string seq and check whether its of the ATCG kind. If its not A or T or C or G you add it into a string called new_seq => new_seq contains only characters that are not ATCG. Before checking the next character of seq in the second for loop you check each character new_seq and if its not ATCG kind you return a false result. The reason you can only get it to return False is with your first if statement new_seq stores only the wrong letters. A good DNA sequence will keep new_seq=- . So new_seq will either contain the value -awrongcharacter or the value -.Thats why you will never get to the instruction:return True which is after the if statement:if char in ATCG:Thats why you could only get your code to return False. I hope it helped. , Resolved,0

After the execution of the for loop  the sequence new_seq would be empty if and only the DNA sequence seq only contained ATCG characters and thus was valid.   You would start like this:    new_seq =     for char in seq:        if char not in ATCG:            new_seq = new_seq + char    #Here at this level of indentation after the for loop check whether new_seq is empty. If it is return True. If its not return False.That might work. See the difference? , Resolved,0
