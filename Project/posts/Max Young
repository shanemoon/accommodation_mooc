Its tempting to just start defining functions but its often so much faster if you really understand the problem first and have run through a few examples in your head.,None,2

Theres a few elsewhere Im pretty interested in too like the Complexity Explorer one... looks pretty interesting!Id like to take some more in Data Science/Data mining and also more programming ones. This course is pretty awesome so far!,None,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 9:21 pm -04:00,Hey everyone nice to meet you!I just discovered Accredible which Im going to be using to to track my learning for the course... thought it might interest some other people on here too! Its basically a profile to list the courses youre taking and it lets you upload a portfolio of your notes assignments completion certificates etc to each one. One pretty cool thing about it is they let you use your portfolios as extra proof of your learning to enhance your resume. Theyve got a gallery of examples here https://www.accredible.com/gallery. Anyone using it or something like it? :),None,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 2:58 pm -04:00,Im not sure myself but I am enjoying it so far actually. Its quite nice to have a sort of record of my learning. @Tom theyve not really emailed me much so doesnt seem spammy. Let me know if you try it out Id be interested to see what you think!,None,0
