Saturday August 31st 2013 12:53 pm -04:00,Is there somewhere where the max points for each step are listed? I had to search through the forums just to determine whether I had submitted correctly because the feedback isnt clear ( especially listing failures etc.). Ive done other coursera courses ( including on python) and each is different; the format of this one is a bit more confusing than Ive seen before., Resolved,1

Saturday August 31st 2013 2:34 pm -04:00,I am step #6. I dont have any questions about how to write the functions. But Im not sure what the output of time_from_utc or time_to_utc should be.All of the examples give whole hours; so are we just supposed to be converting hours in different time zones?It seems from the other steps that we should be able to enter times in seconds and time zones and give an output something like>>> time_from_utc (+0 10993)03:03:13 >>>time_from_utc (+2 10993)05:03:13So I dont understand why the time arguments for time_from_utc in the examples are given as the number of hours and the outputs are just in hours as well?  Are we just trying to build the functions for the clock gui to use?, Unresolved,0
