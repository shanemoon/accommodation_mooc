Thursday September 26th 2013 1:33 pm -04:00,Hi WendyDid you manage to get the read_board function to return a list of list of str?  Your results should look something like this.>>> read_board(file)[[E F J A J C O W S S] [S D G K S R F D F F] [A S R J D U S K L K] [H E A N D N D J W A] [A N S D N C N E O P] [P M S N F H H E J E] [J E P Q L Y N X D L]]If you are able to get the above results and yet encounter the errors you mentioned above I am guessing that its probably because your coding isnt generic enough.  You may want to try re-writing your code in another way.Hope this helps.Cheers., Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 12:24 pm -04:00,its really difficult to see what may be wrong when we cant see the exact codes which were written (but we cant share our codes in the discussion forum...(-_-)....)just to share (if its any help) that i wrote my codes for read_board using only for loops; i didnt use any while loops at all.  i used 1 for loop to extract the different lines in the board1.txt and another for loop to break up the lines into individual characters to get the results., Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 12:55 pm -04:00,Hmmm.. I used the rstrip() function in my code and it seems to be okay.  Probably you can try using rstrip again? since it removes the trailing white spaces only if they exist.But totally agree with you on that the error feedback makes no sense.  I hit some errors in my initial submissions and reading the error feedback doesnt help at all.  Its like some geek-speak e.g. False is not true?? (haha).  Was left doing some trial-and-error changing my codes till they work finally., Resolved,1
Thursday September 26th 2013 6:33 am -04:00,I keep encountering the same error when I tried to open a text file.  Tried various text files from different sources (including the text file from the lecture) but still experienced the same problem.The code and error message is as follows.>>> open(myfile.txt r)<_io.TextIOWrapper name=myfile.txt mode=r encoding=cp1252>I have checked that the file is in the correct working directory and have tried to google this error message but I could not find anything that is useful to solve this problem.Would appreciate some enlightenment here.Thanks., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 8:30 am -04:00,Hi JonnyThanks for your advice I tried it and the open function works as expected.  Now I realized why I wasnt able to find anything useful related to this error message on google - it isnt really an error message!  Silly me.  Nonetheless glad I learned something here. :)Thanks again!Cheers., Resolved,1
Friday October 4th 2013 2:37 am -04:00,Thank you so much Jen and Paul! I enjoyed this course in Python thoroughly.  From the video lectures to the exercises assignments and exam I have had fun every step of the way.  Both of you made learning Python simple and fun and I certainly look forward to learning more about Python in time to come.Cheers and a great job done!  :), Unresolved,1
