Thursday September 26th 2013 8:13 am -04:00,I barely passed other function tests but ReadWords and ReadBoard functions are very difficult for me.I sumitted my a3.py code already although a3_driver.py file did not work properly.I thought that I could find some clues in detailed summary after auto-scoring process. But I was disappointed because it was not very helpful for me. Please~. I need some help.How can I approach these problem in reading file and system IO part?Which part is wrong in my code?Thanks.def read_words(words_file):     (file open for reading) -> list of str    Return a list of all words (with newlines removed)     from open file words_file.    Precondition: Each line of the file contains     a word in uppercase characters    from the standard English alphabet.        file = open(words_filer)    content =     file_list = file.readlines()    for line in file_list:        content = content + line    file.close()    return content        def read_board(board_file):     (file open for reading) -> list of list of str    Return a board read from open file board_file.     The board file will contain    one row of the board per line.    Newlines are not included in the board.        file = open(board_filer)    line = file.readline()    content =    while line !=:        contnet = contend.append(file.readline.rstrip())    return content, Unresolved,1
