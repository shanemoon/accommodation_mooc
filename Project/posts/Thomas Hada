Thursday September 19th 2013 7:32 pm -04:00,Is there a error in this problem??? and or the answer????  I made a series of numbers in excel... 1523 to 10503 and then deleted the even numbers.  I then did a sum of the range and got the same answer as i got with my while loop.  It was marked wrong on the exercise. I made sure to include 1523 and 10503 in the answer of both Excel and my loop.    I had my loop print out each iteration...so i get 1523. 30484575etc until the answer.i set the beginning num to 1523...the sum to 0 and added each iteration to the sum.....i checked the last iteration and it is 10503 more than the second to last value for the sum......Grrrrr, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 3:23 pm -04:00,def for_version(L):    found_even = False    total = 0    for num in L:        if num % 2 != 0:            total = total + num        found_even = True    return totalfor_version([1234])4i dont understand why this does not terminate after the first iteration and give an answer of 1.Thanks, Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 9:04 pm -04:00,Please check the example 1523 to 10503  that the answer is correct.I have written a while loop and also did a manual summation in EXCEL and i got the same answer... It was marked as wrong...Could you please check the answer for this example..sum(xxxxe(1523105042))answer  xxxxx383, Resolved,1

Friday September 27th 2013 4:08 pm -04:00,yes that is MUCH clearer......... I spent many hours with the same question...what to get......what a waste of time!!!, Unresolved,2
Friday September 27th 2013 4:46 pm -04:00,PLease...Please  Make a video going over this weeks assignment.  I think many people spent excessive hours going through this assignment.  Maybe it was too much material maybe more examples and exercises were needed...but im sure many people would get alot out of a clear explanation of the answers.... It would really help solidify the knowledge and help with the next week and or finalThank YOU for your effortsTom, Unresolved,4
Saturday September 28th 2013 10:25 am -04:00,I asked for a video from the professors to clarify the concepts and help students learn what was expected.  Im not sure if the poorly and misleading doc statement was intentional for the last example.  Perhaps it was to give the students some perspective about not having all the answers to complete the problem and or misleading information.  But as beginners I think better clarification is warranted.If you agree about the video...give it an UP VOTE...Of course this is a free course...so i appreciate the hard work that the team have provided so far... , Unresolved,-1
