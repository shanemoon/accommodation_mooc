Monday September 9th 2013 11:04 am -04:00,I want to understand one more thing about this assignment.  Looking at the to_24_hour_clock(hours) we can see that it takes only one parameter and that is hours.  And when we look further at the starter code given for this problem the type contract for to_24_hour_clock(hours) is a number. So the suggestion given by Matthew for the problem I asked earlier involves a conversion from seconds to hours inside the brackets (seconds_past_midnight//3600)...  Its like we are using three things or type contracts inside the bracket: a number(seconds) an operator(//) and a number (3600).  So isnt it against the rules of Python though it runs the code fine?  Or are these three things equivalent to a number i.e. the type contract?, Unresolved,0
