Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:26 pm -04:00,Hi Tamara and ErikaI (perhaps like both of you) am doing this course just for fun- my own self interest and have found that sometimes the computer jargon and discussion is not in plain English but in pythoneese as you said- which is frustrating (and can cause disturbed sleeping patterns!)  Fernando Jimenez and Jeffrey Leung have done a fantastic job- Thanks guys! , Unresolved,1

Thursday September 26th 2013 8:34 am -04:00,This STUPID STUPID machine and it’s incompetent user (=me) I get the correct answer for this question using thismethod:>>>i=0>>>result=0>>>while i<10509:                result=XXXXXX                I=XXXXXXprint (result) BUT WHY when I use return result or return (result)instead of the print statement above do I get an error message: SyntaxError:return outside function.I have tried this dozens of times placing “return result” ondifferent lines after >>> or trying return then result in parentheses., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 11:15 pm -04:00,OK Anonymous thanks for that explanation.I as you can see am not familiar with computer  language so I expected something like:return (answer) to give me an answer on the screen and print (answer) to make the answer available to print on a piece of paper, Unresolved,0
