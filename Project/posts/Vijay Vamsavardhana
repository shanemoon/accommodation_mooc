Tuesday August 20th 2013 11:30 am -04:00,Many of us want an intensive course on programming with python. I was looking forward to a ton of homework that I would be graded or evaluated on; At the least I expected three assignment papers which made you think work hard and get through with an amazing educational experience. This seems far too easy. I hope you guys up the ante. Coming from Madras India where I do not have the opportunity to sit for classes on programming where the teacher actually says something interesting. I am really thankful to you guys for taking the time to post this but I want a brain workout I mean what is this? I want more. Many other guys out there want more. I want this to be a defining mark on my academic profile. I am thankful that you guys are devoting so much time to helping the world but I want it to be a wee bit more challenging at the least.  Thanking you Vijay, Resolved Locked,-30
