Friday August 23rd 2013 4:28 pm -04:00,This worked for me until I got to the last lecture of the week and realized I dont have Run or Format in my toolbar. It downloaded version 3.3.1 not 3.2.3. I tried using the same phraseology in my terminal to get version 3.2.3 but it doesnt work.Reading package lists... DoneBuilding dependency tree       Reading state information... DoneE: Unable to locate package python3.2.3E: Couldnt find any package by regex python3.2.3 Is their any way to add Run and Format to my toolbar? , Resolved,0
