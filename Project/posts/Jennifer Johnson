Thursday September 12th 2013 5:08 pm -04:00,Do we need to consider invalid characters entered into the dna string parameter for the get_complimentary_sequence function?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 5:36 pm -04:00,Secondary issue..... and I have seen this mentioned on multiple other threads but so far no resolution that applies to me...... I too am receiving points off for things that are successful in IDLE like when an empty string is entered when nucleotides are repeated multiple times in the dna string entered and using the test case from the handout. I am NOT using print anywhere in the entire module - all return statements.Â , Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 5:44 pm -04:00,Nope.One thing did occur to me. Is it important that we include these cases in the function examples? I do not have empty string multiple repeating or the given AT argument in my list of examples., Resolved,0
