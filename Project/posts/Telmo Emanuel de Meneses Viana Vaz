Now you need to understand that if you want to apply this infinite floating number to something that is either practical or quantifiable you need to round the number in order to do that. Note that when you divide 1 by 3 (0.3) and then you multiply this result by three you should have the initial unit but you dont you now get 0.9 and not 1. The way to solve this is by rounding by the decimal points.Im sorry to disagree with my friends above they are right on their explanation but on my point of view this is not an error. Its a solution computer makes due to this math curiosity. However Im just really subscribing what they are saying.Hope Ive make it explicit to you., Resolved,3
