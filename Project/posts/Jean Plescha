Friday August 23rd 2013 1:15 am -04:00,Hello allI have installed IDLE before the course started and in the lecture it pointed to the x86 package... but I installed Python 3.3.2 Windows X86-64 MSI Installer (Windows AMD64 / Intel 64 /X86-64 binary [1] -- does not include source)instead... is that ok? I chose this because I have an AMD CPU and Windows 7 64x.just want to make sure is there any real difference between the two?Thank you,None,0

Thursday September 5th 2013 1:12 am -04:00,Well... it maybe better if the actual Lecture used Types expected in the quiz...We are here to learn I think not here to do Guest work I do not have a Crystal ball to be able to guess that the Quiz expects int str float .... when throughout the lecture we are using (number) -> numberObviously my answer was  (word) -> (number) intuitively...which was wrong.Consistency in Teaching eliminates confusion and improves learning and ultimately Test results.Otherwise testing people to see if they learned something is pointless and not representative of peoples ability to learn or proof that they have learned and understood.Thank you and with all due respect., Resolved,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 7:59 pm -04:00,helloYes the correct format is  (.....) -> ......  so replace the dots by the correct type., Resolved,0

Saturday September 7th 2013 7:44 pm -04:00,HelloThe exercises on the type have me concerned. So I am asking this question in relation to the Triangle.py example.In this Lecture we see again the type being (number number) -> numberBut in an exam...or well in actual programming it would be false to use this speudocode yes?In a hypothetical exam where we would be asked to formulate the Type for this Function (the area of a triangle)...would the correct answer be(int int) -> float (since there is a division in the equasion?)Thank you, Unresolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 1:20 pm -04:00,Yet he quiz did not accept this... O.oOn the other hand if a function can accept both a float and an Int then a more generic explanation is needed...a number would include both. In that sense I can see it working but I would like to know for sure. I do not like Guess work when I am learning... I think it is good to have clear explanations and clear expectations., Unresolved,0

Monday September 9th 2013 1:51 pm -04:00,You can test these in IDLEint + float2 + 2.4int + int 2 + 2int + str2 + hiAnd see what gives :), Unresolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 2:34 pm -04:00,It is Sep 9 2:32 PM...I get amessage that it is past Due and will not get Credit but hard date is Sep 9 11:59 pm...Just a fluke?, Resolved,0
