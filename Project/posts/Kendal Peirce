Wednesday August 21st 2013 8:24 pm -04:00,I am just curious why after reassigning base to 2.5 that we cant just type in area and get the new result. Why do we have to recall the assignment? Isnt area searching for the value of base and the value of height? Not the previous base = 20 and height = 12?, Resolved,1
