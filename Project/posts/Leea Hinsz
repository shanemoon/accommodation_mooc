Monday August 26th 2013 9:40 am -04:00,Thank you Jen :) for the reply. Please dont take the request the wrong way as I am sure the book is worth the price!! but money is pretty tight right now... and it sounds like there might be a lot of us here that could really use any possible discount! , Resolved,2
Wednesday September 4th 2013 1:31 pm -04:00,I am waiting on the answer to this question also... it shows a badge that Staff Replied but I dont see a post from a TA or instructor??Any possibility this very first assignment will be given some wiggle room?,None,1

Thursday September 5th 2013 4:44 pm -04:00,@Anonymous: about other Coursera courses I certainly understand why people joining late could be a logistical problem. However I did read that if there was a glitch or common misunderstanding that the deadline could be extended...So... at the very least the ambiguity with the extension granted for Assignment 1 versus Exercise 1 should be allowable IMHO...,None,2
Friday September 6th 2013 11:29 pm -04:00,Thank you for acknowledging that you are considering the option at least. I do hope that you will consider the fact that at least some of us are not only completely new to programming but also to the posts and deadline emails (including the confusion over Exercise vs. Assignment terminology...) here at Coursera. It seems a little harsh to lose 5% of our grade for the misunderstanding over such a minor syntax error  [he he he - pun intended :-)  -- I know I know - bad joke but I couldnt resist!]  I am already struggling somewhat with the subject matter and to lose the points for that first assignment might mean the difference between success and failure in this class for me.  In any case although of course I hope for a favorable resolution I do thank you all for the consideration and time you spend considering the issue!,None,1
Saturday September 7th 2013 9:33 pm -04:00,Thank you for your comments Pat. I agree that the left-hand menus are very difficult to navigate as they all lead to completely separate compartments to the course and have been confusing with the exercises and assignments along with the lecture notes and quizzes inside the video sections too...However I do thank you for your kind words :-) -- Im thinking that Ill just probably end up auditing this course so to speak as learning Courseras terminology alone has taken away from my ability to focus on the course itself...I think Ill have to do some more preparatory reading as well. Although this course says no previous experience required I know everything is coming at me too fast to truly comprehend it all and I dont have enough extra hours in the day to spend learning it all at once ;)  Your encouragement however is appreciated as well as all the helpful posts in other forums by other student so at least I wont be giving up just preparing for the next course dates I think.,None,1
Sunday September 8th 2013 4:27 pm -04:00,@Siana C: It definitely sounds like we are in the same boat here.  Thankfully we have lots of encouraging and helpful people here who seem to be happy to share their knowledge -- which is just so motivating!,None,1
Sunday September 8th 2013 5:24 pm -04:00,@Siana:  did you know that both the lecture summaries and the exact word-by-word text of the videos are available to download? (The .srt format even links the voice-over to the exact timing of the video so you can go right to it. For me that makes note-taking much easier as I can just highlight the points I want to note...)   Post back if you need more info ;),None,1
Sunday September 8th 2013 4:24 pm -04:00,To anonymous above who says dont start asking for extending deadlines...  I was somewhat insulted by that comment as there are many of us here who are only asking for one extension for the very first Exercise and only because of the confusing terminology between assignments exercises quizzes homework etc.  I dont think that takes away from the focus of learning either. In addition this thread was specifically marked for a non-specific question so I dont think it took away from those focusing on specific questions.I also have to add though that I feel this thread has greatly helped me and it seems like a few others in our pursuit of learning as such supportive people as Pat have given out a tremendous amount of information tips and ideas about how to navigate and work through the flow of this course for those of us that are beginners here at Coursera.  I for one want to thank everyone here especially Pat that have been so helpful and given me such encouragement to get through this intensive course.  I have not continued to beg anyone for an extension yet I have continued to participate in this thread for all the logistical help support and like-minded learners :),None,2

Wednesday September 18th 2013 6:06 pm -04:00,When I signed up for the current class there was a 2nd class that was going to be starting just about the time this one finishes up. I have gotten very far behind for a variety of reasons including a death in the immediate family. However when I went to sign up to start the next class there wasnt one listed.Has it been cancelled or rescheduled? Or will it be coming up soon as earlier shown?  Alternatively if it is not going to be coming up soon how long will the materials from this class be available online for self-study after the class ends?Thank youLeea, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 7:32 pm -04:00,I was sure there was another one of this exact class because I couldnt decide which one to sign up for... But now its not showing at all :(However thank you for your info about extended deadlines - I have been away from my computer for several days and hadnt caught up with all the news yet :), Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 9:42 pm -04:00,Thank you Alain. Grrr I was SO CERTAIN I saw another sign up date but I guess I was wrong. I appreciate your answer :) I especially appreciate knowing that at least the class materials will be around for a while with the forums and so forth because I really want to finish it even if I cant manage to catch up enough to get a certificate!P.S. I am going to leave this thread unresolved until one of the instructors can maybe give me more details so please dont take offense to this :), Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 1:04 pm -04:00,Thank you for the offer! I think I will just do that :), Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 1:05 pm -04:00,If you dont care about getting a certificate for the class you can jump in. As you see above the materials should all be here for quite some time after the course officially ends., Unresolved,1
