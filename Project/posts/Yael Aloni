Saturday September 28th 2013 5:24 am -04:00,Good night.I am very happy when I get the correct answer in my Python. But then the auto corrector sends me this:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFEARL != FEARLCWONR- FEARL+ FEARLCWONR : Wrong data returned for a rowAnd from here I dont know what I am doing wrong., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 2:30 pm -04:00,Tom Enos. I read all your posts carefully and finally got the points from the autocorrector on this. Now onwards to the next. Your explanations are simple and clear. Thank you., Unresolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 9:50 am -04:00,Another frustration to add to the list.Having an idea to perhaps change the code to get the correct answer but having to wait that  hour to get the autocorrector to check it. Espeically when the code is working in Python., Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 6:31 am -04:00,That happened to me. I went back and through my file and discovered that somehow I had copied and pasted wrong material into the file. Outed it and everything was fine., Unresolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 7:43 am -04:00,Now that time has basically run out I would like to understand how to see the code. The crunchy cows etc. I never got that part. I would like an a b c of how to see the letters and words. Even after Monday. Thanks a lot to everyone who has posted. It was all a big help. , Resolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 1:49 pm -04:00,Chrissie Thanks. Would love that. After Monday is good. Just show me how to see those words and letters on Python. I followed Nadines lovely chart. But I never got to see the crunchy cows., Resolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 3:41 pm -04:00,Wheres the crunch?That was funny Tom.You cant see me laughing but my family sure heard me.I think I mean I havent been able to read the crunchy cows. , Resolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 3:56 pm -04:00,I did. I actually got the 37 a long time ago. I just kept submitting and resubmitting til I got the 37 points. I understand Nadines code. I was just never able to read the words on my computer. Im not being clear. I could never see my mistakes. The autocorrector would tell me what I was doing wrong. So I would fix it without seeing it. , Resolved,0
