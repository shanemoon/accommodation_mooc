Tuesday September 10th 2013 4:16 am -04:00,Im running into the same issue. My answer works for the 2 examples stated in the question and the two posted above. Works just fine though I may have had more brackets than the minimum needed but the syntax is still correct.Â What should I do here?, Unresolved,1
