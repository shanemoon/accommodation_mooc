Tuesday October 1st 2013 11:28 am -04:00,Just a thing: eat isnt in the board even when it is in the wordlist.Because: To make it a bit more challenging there may be words in the words list that do not appear in the board.I think thats stupid (if you want to make it more challenging do something like also check words in reverse not make a wordlist that should be a list of solutions with useless words that arent into the board thats unrealistic) but they set that condition.Even so your code should find cows of course.Cows is the only word in a row in board so you should check the functions related with checking the rows., Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 7:13 am -04:00,Oh. I understand Anant. Well... In my case I get 32 of 37 xDAnd... I left it that way. With this course I have the policy Just one try. What I get in one try thats it.If the course was of more quality I would try more. But after the first weeks I realize that wont be the case.The grade tools are obscure. I can know if really my code is bad of if the grade tools are bad. If the grade tools by example are asuming certain code structure. I dont like the grade system in this Course. The grade system should be more transparent. We should know a few bunch of the assert conditions they do for check locally and for know more precisely where is the error (in case here is really a error...). This way people learn more. I thought that is the target here. Do many complaining that his working code didnt grade and unaware of WHY.Obviously I tried in my local machine a case that the grade said was bad. And obviously it runs fine in my local machine. So... xDI guess that the exam will be a party with this system :DConclusion: Dont take so seriously the grade you get. If you get a 36/37 thats really a good grade :p, Unresolved,0
