Sunday September 8th 2013 12:11 pm -04:00,The problem summary:  After watching a lecture I can access the lecture summary but when I try to access the summaries for a second time there is no result.  I have tried using both html and flash.  Neither work.  I have tried signing off and returning but the problem persists.Steps to reproduce:Screenshot:, Resolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 6:06 am -04:00,Im sorry I didnt explain the problem very well.  Im still getting used to the rigour of programming.Heres another go.I log on to the course and access the lectures.  I find the lecture summary helpful so I click on the icon and down load it to get a copy.  The I go to the next lecture which works fine but I cannot access the lecture summary of that lecture nor of any of the other lectures including the first lecture summary that I accessed OK.  Neither can I access the forum or quiz facilities via the icons.So then I log off and log on again but still there is no response from clicking on any of the lecture summary icons.So then I log off and restart my computer.  Now I can access the lecture summary via the icon but only one time.  After the first successful down load of a summary I then get no response from clicking on any of the icons.Im wondering if there may be a problem with my machine if I have to restart to get the system to work once correctly.Sorry to be so long winded.  I would really benefit from some advice about this difficulty., Resolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 12:06 pm -04:00,Thank you for all your comments and suggestions.  Its really nice to have people out there to help when you are feeling defeated.  For David I am using Firefox and I have cleared the cache following instructions found on the internet.  I have no real idea what I was doing but it seems to have worked!! Ive been back and forwards several times between lectures and lecture summaries and it worked every time.  So thank you very much.  You have been a diamond. By the way is cron important?  Ive looked on the web but not found much that seemed relevant.  And do I have to clear the cache regularly?For the staff of Coursera it looks like this is resolved., Resolved,0
