Wednesday September 4th 2013 1:22 am -04:00,Please see the below 2 examples:1 Example>>>x=[1234]>>>y=x>>>x[1234]>>>y[1234]>>>x.append(5)>>>x[12345]>>>y[12345]Here both x and y values have changed. So I am assuming that no new Memory is assigned and both the variables point to the same memory address.2 Example>>>x=10>>>y=x>>>x+=1>>>x11>>>y101)Why is there a difference in the functionality of the assigning of values??2)Is there any way to create a duplicate memory in case of lists not just pointing to the same memory?3)Are there any such syntax/programming anomalies in python in this category?, Resolved,0
