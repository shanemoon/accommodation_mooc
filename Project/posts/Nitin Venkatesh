Monday August 19th 2013 3:09 pm -04:00,I am running Ubuntu 12.04 so I use the terminal to get on the IDLE interpretor. I am wondering how you load the external .py file as a module to IDLE on Linux just like how the instructors loaded triangle.py as a module into the IDLE interpretor.Thanks in advance :), Resolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 4:13 pm -04:00,Thanks to Sukrit Gupta on the Skype Study Group this problem has been resolved. We need to use the command import filename to import the external .py file.Please note that the command is import filename and not import filename.py After that all the elements present inside of the .py file can be referenced using something like filename.variable or filename.function. Let me write an example to make this clear.nits@excalibur:~$ python3Python 3.3.2 (default Jul  2 2013 00:15:24) [GCC 4.6.3] on linuxType help copyright credits or license for more information.>>> import triangle>>> triangle.area(45)10.0>>> nits@excalibur:~$ cat triangle.py def area(bh):    return b*h/2, Resolved,3
