Monday August 19th 2013 1:46 pm -04:00,Comparing learning to program a computer to learning a language like French or Chinese is the best way to explain my current level of understanding. I understand the basic grammar and words because I know some math and math is everything as far as programming a computer is concerned but I have no idea how to speak or write a good story (app for a smartphone) because I dont know the laws and syntax and rules of this new language that I want to use to write my perfect story.Continuing with the analogy of a verbal language I know what a story is and how to write one but now I have to learn a completely different language and culture and then write my new story within the correct context with all the appropriate rules. If the final story is good then the program achieved its purpose and runs smoothly and fulfills its original objectives. If the story is bad it fails at some step in the creative process by either being impractical or buggy or unusable.PS... unlike verbal cultural languages like Chinese or French Ive heard that once you learn one programming language you basically can learn all the others with relative ease so learning this first language formally is extremely important.,None,0
