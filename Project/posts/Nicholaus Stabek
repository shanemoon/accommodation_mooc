Monday September 2nd 2013 2:49 am -04:00,When I run the module for the Starter Code of a1.py and enter:seconds_difference(1800.0 3600.0)I would expect it to return a result of:1800.0But when I run the module and enter:seconds_difference(1800.0 3600.0)I simply receive a blank response:>>> seconds_difference(1800.0 3600.0)>>> Can anyone tell me what Im doing wrong?, Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 10:51 pm -04:00,Oh ok. Thank you Deeanna Babcock and José Héctor Albano. Much appreciated. I felt so stuck because I thought the sample code should work. That really helped a lot you two. Time to open a1.py and review the empty bodies. , Resolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 2:54 am -04:00,CharlesI understand your frustration. The fact that youve made it this far without speaking the native language is very impressive. My suggestion is to ask for further assistance once the hard-deadline closes on week 4: Mon 23 Sep 2013  8:59 AM PDT (UTC -0700). Although Im not sure the Teachers Assistants would allow anyone to post the answers even after the hard-deadline Im sure someone would be able to give you a similar example in their explanation. I apologize that I dont have anything useful to add for an answer but keep on trying. And again good job for making it so far in the course. See you at the end pal!  :-), Unresolved,0
