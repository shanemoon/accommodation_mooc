Wednesday August 21st 2013 11:37 am -04:00,I know it is a bit premature to ask this (being totally new to programming) but I wanted to know that once we learn Python fully is there any way to get into actual application development using Python? Or is it just good as an educational tool and if so then will it be easier to learn other languages like Java and C++ after finishing with Python and what should I try to learn after this to get into serious programming.Also have to say Im loving it so far!,None,0
