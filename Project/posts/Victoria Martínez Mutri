Sunday September 8th 2013 8:01 pm -04:00,Well I took this course last year in September but I couldnt go through with it. I thought I had enrolled and I was even getting the mails letting me know that the course would be starting soon.Now Ive realised they never notified me when the course was beginning and its too late for me to hand in the assignments Im really sad.Is there anything I can do or do I have to wait until next time? :(Thank youVictoria, Resolved,0
