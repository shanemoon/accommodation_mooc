Wednesday August 21st 2013 6:54 pm -04:00,It is really problematic to solve the in video quizzes as i have a bad internet connection. Is it possible to have the quizzes separate from the video lectures. I like to download the lectures and watch them more easily on my desktop rather than streaming them. I would really appreciate it if the quizzes were taken separately. Solve this issue if you can staff it is really bothering., Resolved,1

The issue sir isnt whether or not i can see the in video quizzes or not it is rather that owing to the bad internet connection they tend to get stuck on load and cause the entire video to stop functioning. The quizzes if possible should be separate as to allow them to load independently and to be solved independently of the video lectures. If you can change the format of your quizzes i would be much obliged. , Resolved,0
