Sunday September 1st 2013 5:49 am -04:00,The description for get_minutes reads: Return the number of minutes that have elapsed since midnight as seen on a clock. (This means that the return value should be in the range 0 to 59 inclusive.)Am I the only one who found the wording a bit confusing? I suggest that ...that have elapse since the last whole hour... or similar would be more accurate would it not?The same for get_seconds., Unresolved,1
Sunday September 1st 2013 7:02 am -04:00,Got the same failure notice. This does not seem to affect the final score though.I believe the particular assertion has been left from some other version of the test. The function description clearly states that the parameter is a number of seconds since midnight (i.e. seconds<60*60*24) so I do not think calling to_24_hour_clock() is necessary., Resolved,0
