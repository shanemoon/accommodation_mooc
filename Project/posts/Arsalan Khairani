Thursday September 26th 2013 12:24 pm -04:00,i didnt got the point. Why should your second code exit there is no return statement but print.in python this rule holds that every indented statement under if is a part of that statement like:if condition > 1:      statement 1      statement 2statement 31 and 2 are part of if but 3 is not. However in other programming languages semicolon is used to represent a block.I think you didnt got the idea of return statement... return wherever is encountered in a function exits the function.Hence in python (not true for other languages) if you just write return it will brief you that it should always be inside a function.having said that i hope you got the answer for your next question the other if statement would never be evaluated since you have return in if body however if there were no return. both if would be evaluated unless they were nested or you have used else....if condition1 > 2:      if condition1 > 3:            statementin this case second if would only be evaluated if first if is true....... contradictory....if condition1 > 2:      bodyelif condition2 > 3:      bodyif first if is true it would never evaluate second if...... if is false second is evaluated.........print statement doesnot exit the code in code no. 2 both if are independent of each other truth of one doesnot affect other so both of these would be evaluated and both grades would be printed....hope i answered your question., Unresolved,0
