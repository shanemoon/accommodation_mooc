Tuesday August 27th 2013 11:36 am -04:00,As Etienne said the idea is function reuse. When someone define a function that does some job don´t repeat that code in some other place just call the function. In this case they provide two functions count_vowels and count_consonants. Using this two functions you must write one statements that returns the number of letters of the word.Apparently in this case using the functions provided or the built-in function len seems to be the same but in another scenario for example count_letters_in_a_var_name it could be not the same.If you want to count letters in this case the function len could not be appropiated try this:>>> len(ab4t5)Check the response and compare with the number of letters in the word (just 3). This is a valid variable name but has 3 letters and 2 numbers. While len will tell you that theres 5 letters using count_vowels and count_consonants will take you to the correct answer.I hope that this helps., Unresolved,11
Monday September 2nd 2013 10:05 am -04:00,I dont its just a clarification to someone to ask himself why not just use len instead of the two provided functions. You must do a sum using the functions that are provided. My  intention was to show you how the reuse of a function can be usefull in other context besides the original problem.In some cases len could be the same but in others dont whereas using the given functions (if are well implemented) always take you to the correct answer., Unresolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 8:22 am -04:00,By default apparently theres no way to clear screen.Theres an open source project that extends IDLE functionalities called Idlex. You can check it here http://idlex.sourceforge.net/features.htmlIts a zip file that you must decompress in any folder.You can install it or run it directly (instructions for installation are in a file in the zip called Readme.txt).To run it in windows you must just double click idlex.py on linux you must open a terminal change into the idlex directory and run:        $ python idlex.pyOnce in IDLEX (which looks just like IDLE but with all the features described in the home page) you can clear the screen pressing ctrl-lMay be you should give it a try., Resolved,2

Sunday September 15th 2013 12:26 pm -04:00,you must also remove the quotes around dna2 in the body of your function. Take into account that you must reference the parameter name to include the value received. You instead are including the string dna not the value that the parameter contains, Resolved,1
Sunday September 15th 2013 1:04 pm -04:00,Before you change print for return try the following to see that print and return are not the same:>>> com = get_complement(T);A>>> print(com)Then change print for return and try again.Youll can verified that the variable com does not contain the same value in both cases. Note that with return com will have the desired value., Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 6:05 pm -04:00,Im agree with anonymous in the design recipe they encourage you to write examples of invocation to the function in the docstring.Theres a module that permits you to check that your function complies with those test casesCheck this silly function that increments the parameter in one>>> def testExample(param):        >>> testExample(3)    4    >>> testExample(5)    6        return param + 1;>>> import doctest>>> doctest.testmod()TestResults(failed=0 attempted=2)>>> If you think a little this is some kind of TDD.,None,4

Tuesday September 17th 2013 9:53 pm -04:00,You also may have into account that python treats strings as a list of chars.Try this in IDLE:>>> str = Hello>>> str[1]And see what happens., Resolved,5
Thursday September 19th 2013 11:30 am -04:00,You are almost there but there´s a little confusion:When you say:a[1] = AB[0]you are accessing the element of the list at index 0 and not from index 0 to the end.If you want to do that (as I think you know) you must add a colon without the upper index like:a[1] = AB[0:]  #here a[1] will contain AB See this example try it in IDLE and try to understand what I said:>>> st = HELLO>>> st[1]E>>> st[1:]ELLO>>> Hope it helps., Resolved,1

Tuesday September 24th 2013 11:45 am -04:00,Any object can be tested for truth value. There are some special values that are considered False and all the rest are considered True.See this link to check all the cases that are evaluated as False: http://docs.python.org/3.2/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testingWhen you are going through the lines of a file the variable always have a value that evaluates to True. When the EOF (end of file) is reached the method readline returns an empty string () and this is one of the cases that evaluates to False.Thats why While line:works. line is always evaluated as true until the EOF.I hope it was clear., Resolved,4
Wednesday September 25th 2013 8:12 pm -04:00,Hi Artyom:               If I execute this statements (including the definition of the function) in this order (I only added the call to the function and closing the file) I can see the sentences written to the file.Please confirm that if you do this your file is still empty.>>> filename = d:\lecture_code.txt>>> file = open(filename w)>>> sentences = [I wanna be I have to go Would you like?]>>> def write_to_file(file sentences):         (file open for writing list of str) -> NoneType    Write each sentence from sentences to file one per line.    Precondition: the sentences contain no newlines.            for s in sentences:                  file.write(s)                  file.write()>>> write_to_file(filesentences)>>> file.close(), Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 7:41 am -04:00,Lets define the function first and then call it more than once with diferent lists.Try it like this in IDLE (you can have problems with indentation during copy/paste if its happened correct them):>>> def write_to_file(file sentences):	 (file open for writing list of str) -> NoneType	Write each sentence from sentences to file one per line.	Precondition: the sentences contain no newlines.    	for s in sentences:		file.write(s)		file.write()		>>> filename = c:\lecture_code.txt>>> file = open(filename a)>>> sentences = [I wanna be I have to go Would you like?]>>> write_to_file(filesentences)>>> file.close()>>> moreWords = [More Words To Add]>>> file = open(filename a)>>> write_to_file(filemoreWords)>>> file.close()>>> This is working for me and this is the content of the result file:I wanna beI have to goWould you like?MoreWordsToAdd, Unresolved,1
