Tuesday September 3rd 2013 1:01 am -04:00,Call me an over achiever but I now wonder how I can get 42/41 points. You guys mentioned it on the homepage before I got a chance to do Assignment 1. I just finished it but I only got 41 points. Do the test cases check for documentation too?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 1:13 am -04:00,Upon further reflection I see that I have 1 failure. How do I figure out where the failure is?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 1:32 am -04:00,excellent that helped! Now I got the illusive 42nd point. I had failed the large test case cause I didnt call to_24_hour_clock.thanks so much for your help!, Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 10th 2013 6:05 pm -04:00,str.lower(white_rabbit)white_rabbit.lower()are these effectively the same?When Professor Gries explained this in video 3 of week 4 I got confused. Why would we call the method lower on the object white_rabbit in a different way than we earlier called square root on an object (math.sqrt(144))?wouldnt it be easier to just call str.lower(white_rabbit)? That way you use the same syntax of module.method(object).I realize that you save a little bit of space by just calling white_rabbit.lower() but its confusing right? Harder to read later on and to maintain? The first thing Id ask myself if I saw that in code is if there was function called white_rabbit that was previously defined elsewhere..., Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 10th 2013 6:47 pm -04:00,equally I wonder if Im alone in finding the second one more readable than the first? It clearly states call module str with method lower on object white_queen followed by another method count with object jamwhite_queen.lower().count(jam)str.lower(white_queen).count(jam)Are there things you cant do with this cleaner syntax?Whats wrong with it? There have to be reasons not to use it... ;), Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 4:09 am -04:00,Thanks Larry! Everything you a saying makes perfect sense to me. And I get that white_rabbit.lower() is supported and works fine.I am just wondering if str.lower(white_rabbit) isnt t easier to read?It is for me. Mainly because if I see white_rabbit.lower() white_rabbit might also come from a separately imported function rather than a string object.I am also curious if there are certain things that just arent doable with the str.lower(white_rabbit) approach. In my inexperience I dont know what I dont know and Im wondering if anybody here has a better idea.At any rate this is great fun! :), Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 3:06 pm -04:00,Let me start by saying that I think the lecture on Reading Files was inadequate. It was way too short and super confusing. Ive watched it a half a dozen times already and my head is spinning.So Im having a lot of trouble with read_words. Ive been reading the forum posts but to no avail. Everything else in my a3.py file works beautifully. :)Its easy to get the following returned via readlines[CRUNCHY COWS EAT GRASS]but what I want is[CRUNCHY COWS EAT GRASS]so Im thinking I should run a for loop on this and remove the  part. rstrip is supposed to do that on strings right?but now I cant figure out how to include rstrip in my function on the strings in the list. I need help! :), Unresolved,0

Friday October 4th 2013 4:27 pm -04:00,I didnt know there was a restriction. If I did something bad I apologize! I figured there was no harm in sticking heads together like in a study group. And pair programming is cool!I have finished read_words but I dont get how I can use the same method here. Im a little stumped and feeling more than a little stupid., Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 4:55 pm -04:00,good start.my read_words is actually super efficient. Its just a new empty list followed by a second new list that reads in the lines words_file.then i have a for loop running over the second list where a single line appends the rstripped word to the first list. Done. Easy peasy. But Im still struggling with read_board:I have two empty lists followed by a third board_list that reads in the lines from board_file.then I run a for loop over the third list where I append each stripped line to the second list. That list then is[EFJAJCOWSS SDGKSRFDFF ASRJDUSKLK HEANDNDJWA ANSDNCNEOP PMSNFHHEJE JEPQLYNXDL]now I need to read each character of each element from that list and put it in a new list inside the first empty list I created making sure I create a new list after each element is created in the first empty list.I have no idea how Im going to do that! :), Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 5:14 pm -04:00,Im sorry I dont get it. Is this saying I should do a while loop nested in a for loop?how do I go to inner loop?I thought I was on the right track by at least having the first list have this:[EFJAJCOWSS SDGKSRFDFF ASRJDUSKLK HEANDNDJWA ANSDNCNEOP PMSNFHHEJE JEPQLYNXDL]is that not right?, Unresolved,0

But of course Im stumped by that!, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 5:28 pm -04:00,no while loops for this since I know I dont want to end anywhere in the middle of it. And I dont have the problem of the new line char anymore cause I used rstrip to remove that.but I am still confused by what you are saying..., Unresolved,0

That means I just got 70% and passed the course before I even looked at the final weeks material. That feels good! I still feel like the slowest coder in the world. This assignment took me the better part of today and a couple of hours yesterday. Yikes!And the best part? read_board is only 8 lines of code. It feels rather elegant if I do say so myself! Im elated and exhausted!Thank you Anonymous for your help.

Friday October 4th 2013 6:00 pm -04:00,is that the one with the extra space at the end of the list?when you append the line to your list just add rstrip() to the line. Thatll remove the trailing line break. :), Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 6:09 pm -04:00,you need to add it when you run the for loop on each line of the file when you first import the strings into a list. then its gone right from the start.you know you can do this right?list_name.append(line.rstrip()), Unresolved,0

Awesome! I was a little hesitant to even come to forum asking for help in the first place because I couldnt even frame my problem properly. Thank you for helping me out in my hour of need! Im glad I could help you the rest of the way there!I think all of this shows something Ive believed for a long time: Perseverance is the most important ingredient to success! After all it took Edison over 6000 failed tries before he finally found the right filament for his light bulb. Enjoy your well earned weekend break!, Unresolved,0
