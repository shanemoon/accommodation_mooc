Wednesday August 21st 2013 12:46 pm -04:00,Since I use words as words and expect them to represent words I didnt like the wording either.  The addition and subtraction are really independent not sequential (not in an order relative to each other) and I think thats where the confusion lies for those of us not steeped in this mathy logic stuff.It should have said something like:  (Hint:  Theres no need to rearrange the numbers.  Just add parentheses so that the addition occurs by itself and the subtraction occurs by itself and then the result of the addition is divided by the result of the subtraction.)While it does say order of operations that can be read as implying an order one must ALSO apply to the results as one gets them.Make sense?Oh and then it should add:  To verify in IDLE the value you end up with should = -1.4, Resolved,0
