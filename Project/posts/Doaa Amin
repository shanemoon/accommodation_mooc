Friday September 13th 2013 2:49 pm -04:00,HelloRegarding assignments instructions: please add all thats required to be shown as the output of the code. For example in the is_sequence_valid: the instructions didnt require the validity of an empty sequence string yet it was required during the correction of the assignment. Please add whatever thats required as an output in the next assignments instructions and thanks a million in advance :)RegardsDoaa., Unresolved,0
