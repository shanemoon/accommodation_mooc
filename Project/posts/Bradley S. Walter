Sunday August 25th 2013 11:10 am -04:00,The above function wont work as written since the colon is missing at the end of the header line.Idle should automatically indent the body lines of the function by 4 spaces.You can make some syntax errors in the header line that arent flagged immediately upon hitting return to start the body and idle will still indent correctly (e.g. if you leave a space between the function name and the start of the parameter parentheses. In other cases such as omitting one of the parentheses it will indent too far. If you are composing in a plain text editor do not use the tab key or any other kind of automatic indenting feature. Just insert 4 spaces at the beginning of each body line. If you accidentally left a space between the function name and the parameter parentheses you wont get an error message until you try to call the function. Brad Walter. ,None,1

Monday August 26th 2013 11:35 am -04:00,Thats right. Help is a function so you need parenthesis with an argument if you are using it from idle. However if at the idle prompt you type help()  {no argument inside the parenthesis} and return you enter an interactive help utility. Then at the help prompt you only have to enter the function object keyword or topic name at the help prompt. Brad Walter,None,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 11:27 am -04:00,You have to read the definition of this function carefully It actually want the number of hours since the immediately prior midnight so as Xiaosu Xue suggested you have to do something to take account for someone entering a number of seconds greater than the equivalent of 24 hours. The description of the function in the assignment actually tells you exactly what you need to do to correct this error. I made the same error and had to read the description again to understand what the function should return. Got It?Brad Walter, Resolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 7:32 am -04:00,EtienneCan you look at my off topic post about downloading Python visualize and path statement. I am also saving modules I create in the top level python directory. I would prefer not to do that for the reasons stated in the above post. In this lecture the statement was made that a module called by another module should be stored in the same directory as the calling module. That implies for example that I would not want to call the math module from within the triangle module since they are stored in different directories. Instead I must call the math module in the main program because python has the path information to locate modules distributed with it when called from the main program. could I call a module from a different directory from within a module by first executing some sort of change directory statement and then after calling the module change back to the directory where the calling module is or is there a way to include path statements in a module so that you can call modules in other directories.?Brad Walter, Resolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 7:36 am -04:00,Oh I also meant to ask where the math module is located? I searched through the Python33 directories and could not find it. This is just a matter of curiosity. I have found that it is often very helpful to know where stuff is located so you dont end up with lost files or one file trying to access another that it cant find and you dont know where to program it to look., Resolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 6:36 pm -04:00,Well I searched everywhere under Python33 in Windows for math and __math__ .  in The closest thing I can find is Python33\Libestest_math.py. However this file appears to be some sort of test utility and one of the first statements is import math. See below.# Python test set -- math module# XXXX Should not do tests around zero onlyfrom test.support import run_unittest verbose requires_IEEE_754from test import supportimport unittestimport mathimport osimport platformimport sysimport structimport sysconfigIf you go to http://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html?highlight=module%20locations and scroll down to section 3.3.3 Finding Modules it directs you to the Lib subdirectory. I cant find it in that directory or any subdirectory of Lib. As Geoffrey Rushs character frequently exclaimed in Shakespeare in Love Its a Mystery!After writing my initial e-mail I realized that you can use a module in any other module you import without importing it into the main program first but you would have to include import statement in the calling module before trying to call anything in the referenced module AND the referenced module would only be available in the module that contained the import statement. It appears that third party modules - this could include the ones the user creates - are intended to be in a subdirectory of  Lib called site-packages. This is covered in the above section in the doc on using python with windows and a README.txt file in that directory states: This directory exists so that 3rd party packages can be installedhere.  Read the source for site.py for more details.However for backup reasons. I think it would be better to include an add additional path in the registry to a folder in the users My Documents directory. Now If I only knew how to do that. Ill have to get one of the Windows mavens in my company IT department to show me. Brad Walter, Resolved,0

If the problem is fixed please check the above box and make a post to let staff know that they no longer need to monitor this thread.What Problem? Does it refer to the problem I reported with scoring Assignment 1?

Friday September 6th 2013 8:24 am -04:00,Thank you Etienne. I now understand. I missed that post. When the view page on my initial trial showed I had a score of 41 and 1 failure I incorrectly assumed that the first number was the max score and the second was the actual.

Thursday September 5th 2013 10:00 am -04:00,Guys Is there anyway to download Python Visualize so that I dont have to be on line to use it. before this course is over I will be at a place with really poor internet access (but great night skies for stargazing). It would be a lot better if I had all of the tools on my computer rather than needing the internet to use them. Second question: in the foggy past I knew the purpose of a path statement associated with an executable. Can someone remind me? is it just the directory where the program defaults to save and load files or is there more to it? If not more to it could I set the path to a directory in my user account area instead? When loading Python in windows there is an option to load a path statement to the registry. The default is not to load it and I didnt. Subsequently when I tried to load saved  . py files Python didnt know where to look which isnt surprising. I subsequently loaded the top level python directory (which was the default) using the  command window. However. I like to keep stuff I create in my user account area. rather than mixed in with program files. Even though stuff I create may be programs it is in essence executable data to the Python environment and keeping it in my user area is better from the standpoint of intermediate backups. Thanks for definitive help.  I must be getting to the stage in life where my brain is getting full and old stuff gets pushed out to make room for new. Brad Walter.,None,0

Sunday September 8th 2013 8:00 am -04:00,Etienne Is the shell program to which you refer the Dos shell = command prompt in Windows?,None,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 8:20 am -04:00,OK wasnt sure which one you meant. I reloaded python into the Program Files (x86) directory and used your first method of starting in the python directory in the documents folder in my user area. HOWEVER that only works when you start idle from the shortcut. So now that I know which shell you are talking about I will execute that statement which should add the path no matter from where I start python. Thanks. Brad Walter,None,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 2:15 pm -04:00,But those commands in the Python shell only work for the current instance of python. Also it doesnt place you in the directory you want in working path. Here is what I found worked from the python shell:import osimport sysworking_path = C:\\Users\\Brad Walter\\Documents\\Pythonsys.path.append(working_path)os.chdir(working_path)os.path.abspath(.)the last statement simply checks to make sure that you are where you think you are. I saved this as a text file in the Python 33 program directory so I had it for easy reference. Also I created a file path_working.py and saved it in the same directory. This doesnt seem to work from the shell but it does work in IDLE if you open it and then run the module. def set_working_path():    import os    import sys    working_path = C:\\Users\\Brad Walter\\Documents\\Python    sys.path.append(working_path)    os.chdir(working_path)    return os.path.abspath(.)the return statement confirms that it worked and you are now in your working directory. setting the path to your working directory one time in the start in parameter box of the desktop icon for IDLE is the easiest way of setting up your working directory but if you use the shell or dont start IDLE from the desk top icon the other methods work. Interestingly or perhaps oddly you execute the dir() function lists the contents of the current scope as>>> dir()[__builtins__ __doc__ __file__ __loader__ __name__ __package__ set_working_path]I  have no idea where this is pulled from. It doesnt agree with the contents of any directory I could find and set working path is the function name in my path_working.py file.  However if you use dir(.) which you would think would correspond to the  contents of the current directory and perhaps subdirectories You get another much longer list which also doesnt seem to correspond to a particular directory. Certainly there is a methodology at work but it isnt obvious.  I know for example that there is a module called __builtins__ but I cant find it.

Saturday September 7th 2013 7:14 pm -04:00,After the hard deadline for this and future assignments are the course instructors going to publish some examples of code they consider good code for the assignment? Passing the tests is one thing but evaluating style and efficiency is something else. I really appreciate the automated grading but I think having professional solutions to compare with our own efforts would really be helpful and spur some creative discussion about why one way and not another or perhaps improvements that the pros didnt consider. Brad Walter, Unresolved,1
Friday September 13th 2013 11:48 am -04:00,I know the wording seems odd at first but it is definitely not ambiguous and it is precisely correct even though I had to read it three times to jog my memory.  in Boolean algebra A OR B  -> True is exactly equivalent to NOT(A) AND NOT(B) -> FalseA -> True if and only if NOT(A) -> False.  B -> True if and only if NOT(B) -> False.  Something cant be true and false at the same time. For A OR B -> False then both A and B have to be False which means both NOT(A) and NOT(B) must be True NOT(A) AND NOT(B) -> True. So the statement of the problem is precisely correct even though a first reaction may be a shake of the head together with an exclamation what the . . .? Brad Walter  , Resolved,2
Wednesday September 18th 2013 8:08 am -04:00,suppose  I want the string argument of a print call to print on one line because it is  < 80 characters but the print call with the argument will be longer than 80 characters.

Thursday September 19th 2013 5:11 am -04:00,Thank you Allen.I see you are used to an earlier version of Python than 3.x. I had not picked up on the general use of \ as line continuation  character for statements in general. I knew that you could wrap lines inside () by just returning to the next line.Somehow the info on the very next line of section 2.6 in Practical Programming which has turned out to be a good reference text for this course. It certainly did not register that \ would work inside a string. , Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 12:09 pm -04:00,Thanks Vadim but in the example with  I dont want to print the long text string on two lines which is what this will do. I want to spread out the print call to two lines without affecting the format of the output of the print call for example.hour = str(10)min = str(59)sec = str(23.213754)print(hour + : + min + : + sec Field 57 is the UT equivalent of HJD in sexagesimal format hh:mm:ss.ssssss.)The output of the print statement is formatted as I want it to be. with the time on one line and the explanation on the next line. However the statement itself is too long. I need to wrap it to the next line in the middle of the long string without affecting the format of the output of the print statement. I could break the string into two with plus sign between them and simply continue on the next line something like the followingprint(hour + : + min + : + sec Field 57 is the UT equivalent of HJD +      in sexagesimal format hh:mm:ss.ssssss.)I was trying to find out if there is a better way to do this.the %s! % seems to be some kind of appending operator but I cant find a reference to % used this way only as modulo. I checked help on print and I checked all references to % in Practical Programming 2nd edition. Where does this come from? Brad Walter, Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 18th 2013 8:53 am -04:00,Question 1:So far in lectures we have run programs from IDLE.  How do you run a file directly from the command line? if you import a program the main part of the program will only run once and you cant run it again unless you restart the command line interpreter. Also If you import a file the functions in the file are called as functions in a module <filename> and you have to call them as filename.function(arguments) rather than function(arguments). Therefore importing a file seems to be different from running it. Is there a way to run a file directly from the command line and is there a way to run it more than once without restarting the command line interpreter?  Question 2:If a function defined in a .py file calls other functions defined in same file must the functions it calls be defined before the calling function is defined? If I understood the lectures on visualizing program execution correctly variables for all of the functions defined at the main level of the file (i.e. are not defined only as local variables in other functions) are created when the file is imported. If that is true then the order of defining functions in the file should not matter as long as they are defined at the top level so the function names are global variables.  I just have to be sure that anything called is defined before it is called. Do I understand that correctly?Brad Walter,None,0

Monday September 30th 2013 8:06 pm -04:00,Well I didnt go to the announcement page before opening the final so I just blew it. havent completed week 6 or 7 yet and anyway by the time I get home from work the time limit will be up. There has got to be a better way to do this like putting the announcement about the exam being timed in the final exam tab and force someone to click response acknowledging they understand the exam will be timed and you cant stop the clock on exit.Too bad I was enjoying the course and this makes a really bad end. You make an assumption that everyone goes to the announcement page every time before going to the content. That is a bad assumption. Brad Walter, Resolved,-31
Tuesday October 1st 2013 7:02 am -04:00,Thanks for your reply but actually it is very easy if you have created links directly to other pages within the website such as video lectures. You can enter the course through any number of pages without going through the main page and once inside the course website you can navigate from page to page without opening the main page. Internet at my home is quite slow so I download all the new course material I see at my office without looking at it and work on it at home. Unfortunately I checked the final exam page half expecting it would still be blank and I would not have noticed that I might have made a bad blunder except for the timer. At that point I knew I was cooked because the timer would expire before returning home from work so the final exam score will be 0.If there is a procedural detail as important as this the instruction and warning should not reside only on a separate location from the material. That is why for example safety warnings are required on access points to hazardous areas of equipment as well as in the manuals and instructions. A product would never meet the criteria for UL listing and labeling or CE mark without satisfying this requirement. A better way to control access to the exam is is to have the final exam tab open a cover page with a click-through requiring a response to the instruction and warning before permitting access to the exam. You know the kind of procedure you have to follow any time you buy something on-line or when you install software and have to agree to the license conditions before you can proceed with the installation . You cant get to the next page until you have filled in the responses and your responses satisfy the validation criteria. Its my mistake but with all of the technology that has been built into Coursera there is a much better method of controlling access that should not be difficult to implement.  it seems silly and in my case infuriating that the website would permit such a mistake particularly since the technology is already implemented on the website on every quiz and exercise that requires you to respond to the honor code statement before allowing submission.  In my case the only reason this matters is self-satisfaction and a sense of frustration and disappointment after several weeks of effort. The grade isnt important except to my competitive ego but seeing how I stack up against expectations for proficiency at the end of the course is an independent evaluation as to how well I understood and can work with the material. That aspect of the course is no longer possible and I doubt I will devote the time to taking the same course again for that reason alone. I hope the above explanation provides a sufficient answer as to how someone can fail to see the announcement. Further I hope that Coursera web managers and the instructors for this course note the suggestion for improvement  and implement it on future course offerings. It is only because I think Coursera is such a wonderful Idea that I devote the time to respond to such a thoughtless anonymous comment and offer a suggestion for improvement. Brad Walter, Resolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 8:54 am -04:00,SimonI didnt intend to start the final exam. i just opened it. since I didnt enter through the website through announcements page I incorrectly assumed that the final followed the same pattern as other exercises. Do it in your own time and submit before the deadline. The countdown timer gave indicated that was a big mistake. AnonymousThat is a good suggestion. I will have to look around in Coursera to see how I do that. Brad Walter, Resolved,2
Tuesday October 1st 2013 9:16 am -04:00,Well I just searched the main coursera website and under about us there is a contact tab. however when you access that tab Coursera instructs you to submit suggestions in the forums for the course. We are always seeking feedback to improve our courses. If you are an enrolled student and have any questions feedback bug reports suggestions or any other issues specific to a particular class please post on the discussion forums of that class.This is the most effective way to get heard as both the teaching staff and Coursera staff routinely check the discussion forums and your fellow students will also be able to answer your questions and help you resolve technical issues.So I guess I have done what I can to effect improvement. Lets see if Coursera and the course staff do anything with it. Brad Walter, Resolved,2
Tuesday October 1st 2013 12:12 pm -04:00,Tom your analogy breaks down in several places1. entering the course website via a link to a page other than the home page is not jumping the fence. ist is a perfiectly legitimate action. 2. Forums are not analogous to warning signs they are discussion groups and are completely optional.  doubt many follow all threads 3. Posting a warning on the home page is like posting a warning on one entrance of a building that has many rather than posting it on the entrance to the dangerous area.4. Just because the final exam comes at the end of the course is not an indication of danger. It is simply a fact of chronology5.The small warning sign you reference does not say you can only enter once it says Your effective score will be the score of your first attempt made before the hard deadline That means you can only submit your answers once not that you can only enter once on all previous assignments you could enter and save as many times as you desire but there was a limit on the number of submissions usually 3.6. Also posting a sign on a danger area is not sufficient by itself. Access must be controlled. Otherwise if someone is injured you will pay a large liability claim. I could go on but it is pointless. The deed is done and beyond my recommendation for improvement this is not productive discourse. Brad Walter, Resolved,0
