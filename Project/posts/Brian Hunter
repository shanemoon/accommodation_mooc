Tuesday August 20th 2013 4:42 pm -04:00,Hi Kira.  As Wayne says the square brackets indicate an optional argument.  If you type in help(round) it will say that it defaults to 0 so if you leave it out then it rounds to zero decimal places.  In your example    round(54.6665)will give the answer 55.  However if you wanted it to round to two decimal places you would type   round (54.6665 2)which gives the answer 54.67In your own example you would get the answer 54.6665 since the number you specified only has 4 decimal places and you have asked for the number to 5 decimal places so its the same number., Resolved,1
