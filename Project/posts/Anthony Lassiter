Monday August 19th 2013 10:08 pm -04:00,Try opening idle via the command line:1. Open a Terminal window. 2. Type: python3 and if you get a version of python 3.3.x3. Then you should be able to type: idle3.3 and idle will open for youIf you dont have python3 installed then typing python3 wont work. and neither will idle3.3, Resolved,1

Monday August 19th 2013 10:37 pm -04:00,Brett it sounds like there is a permissions problem on your mac. I do not make guarantees but this article says it explains how to repair permissions for OS 10.5http://www.ehow.com/how_5096520_repair-os-leopard-snow-leopard.htmlTry that. If not you may want to reinstall python but make sure you install it for all users on your machine., Resolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 11:11 pm -04:00,im sure it is. I am done for the evening but will check this in the morning. I hope the second install works better. My suggestion below should not be necessary. There are ways to fix your permissions. Let me know how it goes.i prefer to install things with homebrew but thats a little technical and requires the developer tools from Apple but its also better than installing from the source code. Just make sure you have several hours in case something goes wrong. Oh and make sure you have a backup of your files. I wouldnt want you to lose everything if the install failed.if that interests you here is a link to get started: http://brew.sh/ once that is installed you just type: brew install python3 and it installs python3. Then idle3.3 should work. , Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 10:18 am -04:00,NOTE: I didnt use the installer to install so I may only be of marginal help to you. Perhaps someone who used the installer can chime in?In terminal you can typecd /Users/brettsroka/Applicationsor whatever your username is. Thenls -lto get a list of items in that directory. You should see python3.3 if thats where it was installedyou may see python3 then you can use cd and type the name of the directory you want to go intocd python3You may see another directory: 3.3.2 or something like it. Go into that directory and you should see IDLE 3.app or something similar. Let me know what you see at this step and ill see if I can continue guiding you. Alternatively if you have and IM we can instant message for a bit faster response. Keep in mind 300+ people could have your IM name at that point :). but you can delete that post once we connect., Resolved,0
