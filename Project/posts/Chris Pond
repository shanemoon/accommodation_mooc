Thursday September 12th 2013 8:34 pm -04:00,Another MOOC im taking at the moment is computational investing and Im struggling with the homework :(anyway my problem is this: I cant for the life of me figure out how to combine multiple functions.   Ill try and illustrate with a bit theoretical code:def start (A B C):    Z = A+B/C    X = (Z*Z) - B    Q = X+Z+A    print A B C Z X Q    >>> start (202020)20 20 20 21 421 462So this works without a hitch.   But my code is spread across multiple functions.... It looks a bit like this:def start (A B C):          Z = A+B/C          return A B Zdef test_1 (Z B):          X = (Z*Z) - B          return Xdef test_2 (X Z A):          Q = X+Z+A          return Qdef final (A B C Z X Q):          print   A B C Z X Qignore the math inside the functions its jargon... the main point is that I have several different interconnected (i.e. they share some variables) functions each working on a different part of the puzzle manipulating data and returning new values.  But I just cant figure out what sort of code I would have to type in to make the final function return the same information as >>> start(505050) does. any help would be appreciated :)Also any suggestions need to be workable in 2.7 (due to the outdated modules Im using :-0 ,None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 8:47 pm -04:00,Ok  after a little playing I found this:def start (A B C):          Z = A+B/C          return A B Z C test_1(Z B A C)def test_1 (Z B A C):          X = (Z*Z) - B          return X test_2(B C X Z A)def test_2 (X Z A B C):          Q = X+Z+A          return Q final (ABC X Z Q)def final (A B C Z X Q):          print   A B C Z X Q>>>start(5050550)3095 60 50 505 50 3650But I hope there is a better solution to my problem since the above would take a lot of work to implement and looks rather ugly.,None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 9:18 pm -04:00,Ah thankyou this looks promising!Basically the code Im working on has several function calls (at one point it was all in a single function spanning 150 lines!);  Ive got to create a database (a numpy array) and then try and optimise an investment portfolio. To make it more readable I separated it all out into different functions (one calculating the mean another the sharpe ratio another thing printing all the bits to the console etc etc)...of course when I did that I encountered the above problem; linking it all together.  I didnt think it fair to post the actual code even though its for a different coursera course its still possible that writing out significant chunks of code would of given someone an unfair advantage. So I quickly wrote a crappy code to express the idea.     anyway It looks like you figured out my question. so thanx... Off to see if it works!!,None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 9:31 pm -04:00,def controlFunction(a b c):    A B Z C  = start(a b c)    X = test_1(Z B)    Q = test_2(X Z A)    final(A B C Z X Q)I tested Toms code simply add C to the first line and it works fine.   And yes this is the sort of thing I was looking for. Thanx guys. ,None,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 10:26 pm -04:00,I completed that course last time and I would highly recommend it...  (type in youtube rice rocks to see what the final project looks like!!).    It is however a hell of a lot harder than this course (but with that said it was my first course in Python).......but the course is also a lot more rewarding: creating playable games is just a lot of funIf you decide to take it Rodrigo I wish you the best of luck :)  while you wait for it to start you might want to check out the main course tool:http://www.codeskulptor.org/notice that the demo code is about 10 lines and starts up a GUI ! p.s. Not sure if they have updated the course but last time I checked it was all in Python 2.7.    So you know be mindful of that.         , Unresolved,0
