Tuesday September 3rd 2013 4:30 am -04:00,Anonymous started this thread with some potentially-useful terminal inputs for any Linux flavour and Mac .To gain access to functions in a file named module.py from module import * is suggested with the condition that the file must be present in the same directory usually it is your home folder.Im lost! Same directory as what? In Mac OS I have python 3.3 in a folder (along with IDLE and documentation files) in Applications and various .py files (such as calc.py) in my  Documents folder. Via IDLE the Python 3.3.2 Shell allows import calc but terminal responds with No module named calc.I expect there is a simple answer to this but its beyond me.Thanks in advance., Pinned Approved Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 3:15 pm -04:00,Fabricius I think youre probably right. Its just that the opening contribution to this thread had module py in a home folder in Mac OS. Maybe someone can advise how to configure python to look in other directories other than its own., Pinned Approved Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 7:41 am -04:00,In video lecture 3 - 3 (the third lecture in week 2 - who thought up this numbering system?)  our Jen gave two examples of triple quote use namely:>>>print(Howareyou?This generated the expected:Howareyou?But then she offered:>>> s = Howareyou?>>> sHowareyou?Theres something subtle going on here but I cant articulate it. I await an expert explanation of why a different result is produced., Resolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 2:27 am -04:00,Thanks everyone for your valuable contributions to my original post. Im entering all sorts of combinations of: single quote double quote triple quote print() >>> variable = ... \ and trying to predict the output before I press . I have reached an 80% success rate - thats progress!, Resolved,2
Sunday September 1st 2013 12:50 pm -04:00,This is a useful thread. Thanks to Gerry Ricardo David Michiel and Samantha for all the useful explanations. With reference to my original post (scroll up 11 steps!) and Gerrys response Im still wondering what the difference is between a string and the content of a variable that refers to a string!, Resolved,1
Sunday September 1st 2013 9:50 pm -04:00,Keilah I would even go further than Kevin and Alan. I think you should start with the two body problem (a binary system) and tweak the step size until you have things working well. The two masses can be different but not hugely so. Say m1 = 5m2. Space dynamicists use sophisticated orbit integration techniques to make their simulations run efficiently and effectively so I think you have a substantial task ahead of you - well worth doing though.  When you move beyond a binary simulation I think you should try the restricted three body problem first - that is a binary system with one extra body but a very small one say m1=m2=1000m3. The learning outcomes could be very valuable. In principle I would very much like to follow your progress and perhaps even collaborate further.,None,2
Saturday September 14th 2013 3:30 pm -04:00,Monique interesting question! I dont follow Anonymouss (Nicks)  response. My response is that an empty string is in every other possible string including itself.RAB, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 5:05 pm -04:00,I think we should learn some Canadian culture while we improve our python skills. In fact why not integrate the two streams of learning?Monty Python has the answer:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL7n5mEmXJoWith apologies to Jen Paul et al who are doing a great job.,None,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 10:01 am -04:00,I have encountered a problem with using readline() on a file  (testdoc) generated in both .doc and .txt formats in Mac OS 10.8.5. I get:Traceback (most recent call last):  File  line 1 in     testdoc.readline()  File /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/lib/python3.3/encodings/ascii.py line 26 in decode    return codecs.ascii_decode(input self.errors)[0]UnicodeDecodeError: ascii codec cant decode byte 0xd0 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)I have absolutely no idea what this all means!If there any knowledgeable geeks/nerds out there who know what this means and how I can correct whatevers wrong I would be eternally grateful.Thanks in advance!, Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 6:11 pm -04:00,Having started this thread Im pleased to see the resulting interactions. I think this is an excellent example of the value that can be added to our learning through discussion fora. Its good to see Gabrielles problem sorted out. Many thanks to Tom for sorting us both out!RAB, Unresolved,0
