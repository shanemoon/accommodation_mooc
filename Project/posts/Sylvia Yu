Thursday October 3rd 2013 2:50 pm -04:00,I have done this also on Monday when it first came out to overview the questions.  I noticed the seconds ticking and closed it immediately before I got a chance to see it.  This was before I read the warning on the home page.On the exam page it says 0 / 1 attempts. Did I blow the Exam?  I hope not I was looking looking forward to taking it.If I did blow it will I still be able to open the exam and take it for 0 grade to assess my knowledge?Thanks, Unresolved,0
