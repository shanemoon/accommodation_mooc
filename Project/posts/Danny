Wednesday August 21st 2013 3:28 pm -04:00,I noticed that in writing the base function we are to describe a base case in the body of the function.  However the base case is often not run as an example.  While there are many examples in the video.Let me take a case from page 61 of the excellent book that is being prepared.In convert_to_celsius we have 3 cases given but none are the base case 75 degrees.  Shouldn’t we include the base case?I, Unresolved,0
