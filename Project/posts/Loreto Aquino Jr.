Monday August 19th 2013 5:51 am -04:00,hii think that particular quiz has only one fixed answer. if you evaluate the given expression it will give you -1.4 as the correct answer.Â using parentheses so that the operations are evaluated in the following order + - / must give you the same -1.4 as the correct answer. example (3 + 4 - 7) / 2 is incorrect since it will not result to -1.4good day!, Resolved,6
Tuesday August 20th 2013 4:07 am -04:00,@ Margrietthe area computation of a triangle requires a float resultant because of the division involve in it. i guess changing the / division operator into // integer division might give you a misleading result sometimes. remember your function may receive an integer or a float parameter example: allow your function to compute area(0.5 0.5) your function must return 0.125 as the exact answer otherwise if it returns 0.0 that is a misleading answer., Resolved,0
