Saturday September 14th 2013 6:25 am -04:00,Должен заметить что раздел A Day at the Supermarket в курсе по Питону на Codeacedemy содержит баги. Правильный код не проходит валидацию куча ора по этому поводу на форуме. Решается чтением форума и копипастом проверенного рабочего решения (ошибки касаются валидных отступов которые почему-то считаются невалидными агрумента food с какой-то прошлой версии задания вместо заданного в настоящее время аргумента shopping_list это с чем столкнулся лично я). В IDLE всё идеально на сайте - ошибка. Для новичка в Питоне довольно сложно понять его это косяк или валидатора. ,None,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 3:37 pm -04:00,Actually not so long ago the current course Learn to Program: The Fundamentals was also archived.

Wednesday August 28th 2013 11:45 am -04:00,I had refused to prove anything and just submitted the most obvious code where decimals are just not taken into account and values returned are not exactly those that specified in examples in terms of decimals. And bingo - 41 of 41., Unresolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 11:57 am -04:00,They are not since it was mentioned in the Instructions:Floating-point numbers in this handoutThis assignment involves float calculations and as you know these can be inexact. As an example here is code copied from the Python shell:>>> 7 / 30000.0023333333333333335>>> 7 * (1 / 3000)0.002333333333333333Because we leave it up to you to write some expressions your functions may return values that are very slightly different from the examples in our docstrings. As long as they are very close your code will be marked as correct; you dont need to make your code match our expected results exactly.Anyhow I still consider this situation to be confusing., Unresolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:14 pm -04:00,Yes it confused me too however the right decision to >>> hours_difference(1800.0 2160.0)        0.1   is really 0.09999999999999998 at least the automated checking during submission thinks so., Unresolved,1

Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:51 pm -04:00,I have no previous programming backgound. The reason I used dictionaries was that I do another Python course at Codeacademy at the same time and a month ago I wrote a script to conditionally change spaces in a .xml doc into unbreakable spaces (needed that for my work). It took a very long while for me to search through various forums and to write the code below and it was all I knew about Python at the beginning of the course.#!/usr/bin/python3# Make file backupimport sys string os shutilshutil.copyfile(inputfile/file.sdlxliff backup/file.sdlxliff)# Open filefile = open(inputfile/file.sdlxliff r encoding=utf-8)text = file.read()file.close()# Define replacement functiondef replace_all(text dic):    for i j in dic.items():        text = text.replace(i j)    return text# Choose reps for correct target language # Define dictionary setting functiondef choose_dic():	if source-language=en in text:		reps = {№ :№   года: года г. :г.  году :году   января: января  февраля: февраля  марта: марта  апреля: апреля  мая: мая  июня: июня  июля: июля  августа: августа  сентября: сентября  октября: октября  ноября: ноября  декабря: декабря пункт :пункт  пункта :пункта  пункту :пункту  пунктом :пунктом  пункте :пункте  пункты :пункты  пунктов :пунктов  пунктам :пунктам  пунктами :пунктами  пунктах :пунктах  статья :статья  статьи :статьи  статье :статье  статью :статью  статьей :статьей  статьи :статьи  статей :статей  статьям :статьям  статьями :статьями  статьях :статьях  правила :правила } # Dictionary for Target = Russian	else:		reps = {no. :no.  Article :Article   March: March  June: June} # Dictionary for Target = English	return reps# Make replacementsreps = choose_dic()replaced = replace_all(text reps)# Save the text with replacements to a new filefilereplaced = open(outputfile/file.sdlxliff w encoding=utf-8)filereplaced.write(replaced)filereplaced.close(), Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 2:05 pm -04:00,If anyone is interested I just want to tell how I apply Mindmaps (special thanks to Tony Buzan) during classes at Coursera. I hope that this information may be useful for other students. I had attempted the course once in 2012 and failed. Now I am doing    much better.IntroductionAbout Mind mapping – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_mapI am using some of the ideas I have seen in this article (in Russian) slightly modified. http://habrahabr.ru/post/155891/Mind mapping softwareI am using great MindMapping software called Xmind (www.xmind.net) it is open-source and its basic version is completely free. More detailed information is provided below.FoldersAll the information of the course is to be collected and organized – this is how my folders look like:    I hope that one day this folder will also contain the certificate of accomplishment. :)All the materials for each week are stored in appropriate folder. For example this is the contents of Week 4 folder:        Quizzes are downloaded in .pdf format and stored in Quizzes folder the Assignment 2 folder has inside the .py file I submitted for the assignment and the instructions to the Assignment saved (printed in Google Chrome) as a .pdf.         Same for each Week exercise - I print as .pdf the results of my best attempt to pass each weeks exercise.XmindAll the above was about organizing materials. The most important part is about organizing thoughts and ideas i.e. about mind mapping.As I have told I am using Xmind. This is how the fist sheet of my mindmap looks like right now:        When letter “c” on any Week branch is clicked another sheet opens (separate linked sheets are added by Ctrl + Alt + T). It is useful also to rename the default sheet name (Sheet 1) into something like ‘01’ to save space.Here’s a part of the Week 4 sheet:        You can see a VLC Player icon at the right side of the “str indexing and slicing” branch – it is a relative link that leads to a video file with the appropriate lecture. Links to Assignment file and Quizzes folder are also added (not visible in the picture).    It is also useful to include in mindmaps screenshots taken from videos and IDLE insert pictures attach files and make comments. Mindmaps are really pretty useful during exercises and assignments.The mindmapfor the course (current version of 4 weeks) is here. Feel free to download it and view it in Xmind. Of course links to videos and my local folders will not work.If this information is helpful to anyone I’ll be happy. If you have your own techniques that help in learning – I’ll be very pleased if you tell about them. Thank you for your attention., Unresolved,5

Thursday September 12th 2013 1:06 pm -04:00,if char in dna: Just checks whether the char is present in dna but does not change it to its compliment.Try to translate into Python the following:for each character in dna the previous get_compliment function must be applied then the changed char (its compliment as a result of the get_compliment function) is to be added to the accumulator and finally the accumulated is to be returned., Resolved,4

Thursday September 26th 2013 11:24 am -04:00,Finally got 37 of 37. As for the last function it is important not to use rstrip in str.append at all because in the last iteration it returns  but rather to think how to make range(len(string)) (from where characters are taken) not include  at all. , Resolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 1:42 pm -04:00,What does it do? What are the conditions when it returns True? If it just checks whether the string is a palindrome why the range is defined as (len(s) // 2)?, Unresolved,1

Wednesday September 25th 2013 5:05 pm -04:00,I know about the statement just did not want to post all the code.

Wednesday September 25th 2013 5:28 pm -04:00,Hmm.

Some of our answers to the final exam may be technically correct but not evaluated as such by automated tool. So the review of the results performed by our dear Instructors can make our grades worse or better but itll be a fairest evaluation both by machine and human.Another reason I think it is made so not to reveal whether answers were correct or not till the Hard Deadline. There are many ways to violate the Honor Code., Unresolved,2
