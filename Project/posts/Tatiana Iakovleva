Monday August 19th 2013 7:10 pm -04:00,I have the same issue (I am using a PC keyboard). I cant even copy-paste the underscores from this thread directly in Python. Michael what do you mean by I have saved the character __ in a Notepad file ? Do you mean a file with the extension txt?, Resolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 7:30 pm -04:00,Thank you Ivan. It works! And two underscores in a row work too:), Resolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 7:06 pm -04:00,I have the same question. I opened Python33/python.exe that I found in the downloaded package. It allows to do most of the things that the professors deminstrate in the videos. However there is no menu bar (shell file) and some buttons and built-ins dont work (Alt+p dir(_builtins_)). I wonder why the professors only showed how to install OS package. I would have been grateful for a demonstration how to find IDLE on Windows. I simply dont see IDLE in the package that I installed.,None,1
Monday August 19th 2013 7:28 pm -04:00,Thank you Russel! I am afraid I dont see start menu\ programs\python3.x\:( I dont have Windows 8.,None,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 7:29 am -04:00,At the end of the last lecture (Week 1) we are supposed to use Run (so that the Shell file knows how a function is defined in a separate stored file). In Windows there is no Run in the IDLE menu. Whats the equivalent of Run in Windows?, Resolved,3
Tuesday August 20th 2013 7:49 am -04:00,Thank you Gerry!There is indeed the Run command. If I click on it I have three options: Python Shell Check Module and Run Module. I suppose I need to select the first one? That is what I did. However at the moment the Shell file does not recognize say the area function that I defined in triang.py., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 8:31 am -04:00,I selected it there was a new window opening I defined def area in this new window then returned back to the Shell file typed area(23) and got an error message Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#62> line 1 in <module>    area (23)NameError: name area is not defined, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:00 am -04:00,Hi David!Oh I see I did not run the module! So after enteringdef area(base height):    return base*height/2I need to click on the run! Thank you!, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 7:58 am -04:00,def function_name(parameters)def function_name(argument)Is the difference between arguments and parameters only in the number?For instance might I say: if one then argument if more than one then parameters?I see that this is not the correct solution because the definition of a parameter says: the parameter(s) of the function 0 or more and are separated by a comma. Then there might be ZERO or one parameter?? If it is so how ZERO or ONe parameter can be seprated by a comma? I am pretty confused:), Resolved,2

Tuesday October 1st 2013 5:12 pm -04:00,Tom and Vadim I found the problem thank you! It was not about the tabs or spaces - there was a weird word BOX on line 276 that appeared out of nowhere.
