Tuesday August 20th 2013 12:24 am -04:00,In Windows 7(64 bit version)  trying to start up IDLE throws the following message :IDLEs sub-process didnt make connection. Either IDLE cant start a sub-process or personal firewall software is blocking a connection.i tried editing the idle.bat file to open python.exe instead of pythonw.exe which finally started the python shell but with some warnings  Is there any other workaround to run the python shell without these warnings?...Even changing the firewall options to allow Python didnt work.what is the root cause of this error message? is there any configuration to be made to start IDLE?...Could we use IPYTHON instead of IDLE ?Thanks in advance., Resolved,0
