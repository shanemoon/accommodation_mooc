Monday August 19th 2013 3:14 am -04:00,The question was: Rewrite the expression 3 + 4 / 2 - 7 using parentheses so that the operations are evaluated in the following order: + - /.Im not sure if giving an exact answer to this is quite fair so I would prefer an example. I tried (3 + 4 - 7) / 2  as a viable answer but got it incorrect. Perhaps I am not using the right approach. I know the PEMDAS/BODMAS rule. Its bracket content first so I dont understand why (3 + 4 - 7) / 2  should come out as incorrect. Theres even the option of using ((3 + 4) - 7) / 2 but even that came out wrong. I am breaking my head here at 3 in the morning over something that I am sure has a rather trivial answer. So much for being a Mathematics major....Thanks ♫, Resolved,2
