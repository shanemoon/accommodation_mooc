Friday September 13th 2013 3:47 pm -04:00,HiCheck quiz question pls: http://prntscr.com/1r2pc5First 2 options are correct. OK.First option I understand 100% clear.Second option make me wonder and confused about ELSE ELIF.- I dont see a clear difference in using else elif.so if we want substitute this code:if temperature > 28:    if money > 0.99:        print(Im buying a lemonade.)    else:        print(Wheres the water fountain?)by this code:if temperature > 28 and money > 0.99:    print(Im buying a lemonade)elif temperature > 28:    print(Wheres the water fountain?)it is OK.but this will cause conflict or some error ?if temperature > 28 and money > 0.99:    print(Im buying a lemonade)else temperature > 28:    print(Wheres the water fountain?), Unresolved,1
Friday September 13th 2013 4:03 pm -04:00,then like this I meaned:if temperature > 28 and money > 0.99:    print(Im buying a lemonade)else:    temperature > 28    print(Wheres the water fountain?), Unresolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 4:58 pm -04:00,ok as aside I cannot use visualizer because it shows different terms as we can see from video lectures.I dont understant those abstract stupid names. And even worse they are changed in our current visualizer. It seems video lectures are pretty old though.Back to logical operators (if else elif are logical operator correct ?)this question from exercise 3: http://prntscr.com/1r3h9twill be same results and it will be correct and working still if I would make it as this ?def traffic_report(light):    if light == red:        return stop    if light == yellow:        return slow    if light == green:        return goprint(traffic_report(yellow)), Unresolved,0
