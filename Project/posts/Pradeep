Thursday August 29th 2013 2:11 am -04:00,Hi thereI am pradeep. Just not comfortable with the way the assignment looks[ I know its not a real problem] But it would be easy if the assignment comes within coursera rather than linking to amazon. And i feel its not clearly formatted.[No offence just personal view].I have done few other courses in coursera may be thats the reason I feel that way., Unresolved,0
