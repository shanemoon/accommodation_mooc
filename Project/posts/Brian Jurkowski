Tuesday August 20th 2013 8:53 pm -04:00,Problem summary:In several places throughout the course there are dates and times indicating when a video was posted or when an exercise / assignment is due etc.  I find it confusing that these are generally in PDT & UTC unless its from the instructor (in my case a class from the University of Toronto so Eastern Time).  I have to convert times to understand when something happened / will happen.Possible solution:It would be so much simpler if times were automatically converted to the users local time zone or (preferred solution) displayed as relative values instead of absolute values.  Eg.: This exercise last attempted 6 hours ago.This assignment is due in 7 hours and 27 minutes.The forums work this way (relative values) and I find it so much simpler to use as I dont have to convert times at all., Resolved,0
