Wednesday August 28th 2013 4:43 pm -04:00,EDITEDAdditional Exercise for your MindPrefaceYou need to use Python 3 for this exercise. python 2 is not recommended.Required PreparationIn order to complete this assignment youll probably need to have watched all the week 2 videos and also done the week 2 exercise. However you can get a good start understanding the assignment. Understanding what a program should do almost always takes    a significant amount of time possibly as much as an hour or two.Problem Domain: Joes Vacation Trip!We have a little friend Joe and he came to our city on a vacation.he wants to see places in our city and so we ( us) went to nearby tourist center and surprised to see the tourist center full of Systems running python scripts and no humans [ little exaggeration eh :P] .A robot came to us enquired and took us to a portal where the portal asked us how many places Joe want to see?    Joe replied four and selected the places place1 place2 place3 and place4.    Joe wanted to see the place1 first and place4 last and so the portal presented two functions time_to_go() and next_place() and We should help Joe to determine how much it will take him to complete his tour.What to doyou have two functions (given below) available to you :                         time_to_go(place) and next_place(place)    the functions are given in the script here.Exercise Script     you can see the functions purpose by loading the the Exercise Script given above and running help function on them .        Now that you have two functions already made for you you should create a function called trip_time() that takes no arguments and returns the time taken by our friend Joe to visit four places place1 place2 place3 and place4.    trip_time() should return the time in hours:minutes:seconds format to complete four places place1 place2 place3 and place4.you should first start with the place1 and end with place4.    time_to_go() will return the time in minutes ( little difficult to calculate seconds for you ! )    even though we are working with floats the time format should consist of only ints example:    if it took Joe 4 hours 32 minutes and 56 seconds then round_trip() should return 4:32:56 not 4.0:32.0:56.0     Little Pre-requisite Help You could use two functions which i feel worth to explain here: there is a function called int()excerpt from help(int) is given below:int(x[ base]) -> integerConvert a string or number to an integer if possible. A floating point argument will be truncated towards zero (this does not include a string representation of a floating point number!) When converting a string use the optional base. It is an errorto supply a base when converting a non-string.examples of using int function are given below:>>> int(12.23)12>>> int(12/3)4>>> int(124)124there is another function called round()help(round) returns following:round(number[ ndigits]) -> numberRound a number to a given precision in decimal digits (default 0 digits). This returns an int when called with one argument otherwise the same type as the number. ndigits may be negative.examples of using round function are given below:>>> round(23.234)23>>> round(23.24342)23.24>>> round(324/1322)2.45 Caution     You should not use print() function anywhere.    You should Return the value in h:mm:ss format ( without any spaces)  only.    You should use both the functions ( time_to_go(place) and next_place(place) ) at least once in your code even though you feel they are useless. ( the function next_place here is really useless but cant help it ).            you can see this thread https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=762 to know the diff between print and return,None,1

Friday August 30th 2013 2:38 pm -04:00,yes as paul said you should get -1.65>>> hours_difference(600060)-1.65and for you im providing some of test cases:>>> hours_difference(36007200)1.0>>> hours_difference(510)0.001388888888888889>>> hours_difference(1234567890)15.429166666666667, Resolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 2:52 pm -04:00,According to the Free Dictionary:		on the hour:at each hour on the hour mark.example: I have to take this medicine every hour on the hour. I expect to see you there on the hour not one minute before and not one minute after.So what they said is they did not included all the 24 hours possibilities  they said that we should take care of them :)Thats what i know from their sentense Hope it helps!, Resolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 3:05 pm -04:00,First Error says that :you have problem with to_float_hours() function when you are giving 0 seconds or zero hours here are some test cases for you to work on:>>> to_float_hours(110)1.0166666666666666>>> to_float_hours(101)1.0002777777777778>>> to_float_hours(111)1.0169444444444444>>> to_float_hours(010)1.0166666666666666I think first and last will give you errors  try to fix them :)Now second error says that:Your get_seconds() function is not handling seconds above 60and thats why it tested the get_seconds() function with argument 3800 ie >>> get_seconds(3800)produced the error again I hope you got the point :), Unresolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 11:33 pm -04:00,look at the failure error feedbacksselected part of the feedback is given below and explained :in the to_float_hours function:test_hours_nonzero_minutes_seconds_zerothat means that the function is tested with nonzero hours  and minutes seconds to zero [ something like (400) ]test_hours_minutes_seconds_all_zeroabove tells us that the function is tested with all zero inputs ie (000)for the get_seconds:test_greater_than_60above tells us that function is tested with value thats greater than 60test_example_from_handoutabove tells us that the function is tested with example from handoutDanielle sorry if i behaved in a way that it hurted you in my previous comment :/, Unresolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 3:07 pm -04:00,BTW here are some test cases if you want to test your get_seconds function:>>> get_seconds(30)30>>> get_seconds(60)0>>> get_seconds(0)0>>> get_seconds(120)0>>> get_seconds(1234)34>>> get_seconds(1111)31Good luck :), Unresolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 3:36 pm -04:00,first of all you should type these functions which have more than one line  in a different fileokay that saidopen a new window from IDLE  ( you can do this by going to File -> New Window )then type these linesdef perimeter(side1side2side3):    (number number number) -> number    Return the perimeter of a triangle with sides of lengths side1 side2    side3.    #examples        return side1 + side2 + side3now run the module and then type in the idle>>> perimeter(345)12>>> perimeter(3.33.73.6)10.6, Unresolved,0
