Tuesday October 1st 2013 3:18 pm -04:00,Im really lost on this one could you give me some guidance on where Im going wrong. Here is a sample of my code in its current state: num_words = 0    for words in board:        if board_contains_word:            num_words = num_words + 1        return num_words, Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 3:43 pm -04:00,Thank you Tom and Sandy I have made a few changes however the example given is still coming up with 1 instead of 3. This is the new version of code:num_words = 0    for word in words:        if board_contains_word(board word) == True:            num_words = num_words + 1        return num_words, Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 4:20 pm -04:00,Thanks for all your help but Im still not quite there. I have tried to adjust this code many times but Im not getting a good output. item = 0    for word in words:        if board_contains_word(board word) == True:            item = item + 1        return item Where am I going wrong?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 4:31 pm -04:00,Thanks Tom seems to be working better now except it is giving 2 as an answer to the example instead of 3 so I am going to go back to the board_contains_word_in_column to check for errors!, Unresolved,0
