Monday August 19th 2013 8:44 pm -04:00,Thanks we dont have google+ Â access at work. Just google basic. Not sure if I can get it or they dont want us to get on G+ yet. They only just installed google as the standard module yday. We still used Internet Explorer before that. Its all a bit new to me and Im still learning my way around. Those other 2 Gabe McCanns one or both of them are probably me but I created them so long ago I cant remember my password. Will let you know how I go trying to get on G+ eventually. :-)And thanks for doing the video so quickly too :-)PS I talked to someone about Google+ at work and apparently they dont want us using G+ because of Firewall restrictions. Anyway will try and fix up my password problem sometime soon. If not Ill just have to try and create a new identity .I work at the State Library of NSW and our google account is under the jurisdiction of the NSW Govt. Dept of Trade and Investment.,None,0
