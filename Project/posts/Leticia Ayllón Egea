Monday August 26th 2013 11:18 am -04:00,Hi everyone! I have a problem with answers 3 to 6 where you have to write a word. I wrote exactly the same word that appears as the correct answer but it marks my answer as wrong. I have tried with Mozilla Chrome and Explorer and I have the same problem. I even copy and paste the word in order to discard that the problem is my keyboard.Any one knows whats going wrong?Thanks!, Resolved,0
