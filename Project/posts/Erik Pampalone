Sunday September 1st 2013 11:45 pm -04:00,Step 6 is giving me a problem. When I submit my code I get a Failure for the time_to_utc function.The summary says:student: test_time_to_utc.TestTimeToUTC.test_day_behindand the Failure is described as:Method Description:Test the values where time in time zone UTC+0 is just before midnight        but time in time zone utc_offset is just after midnight.        (This means that UTC+0 is earlier than time zone utc_offset.)Message:FAILURE: AssertionError23.0 != 1.0 within 7 placesI pass all the tests given which are:    >>> time_to_utc(+0 12.0)    12.0    >>> time_to_utc(+1 12.0)    11.0    >>> time_to_utc(-1 12.0)    13.0    >>> time_to_utc(-11 18.0)    5.0    >>> time_to_utc(-1 0.0)    1.0    >>> time_to_utc(-1 23.0)    0.0Is there something else I should test to get a SUCCESS instead of FAILURE?Here is what I am doing:I have a return statement.I call the to_24_hour_clock function.I call the absolute value function.I subtract time from utc_offset which looks like (utc_offset - time).Any suggestions on what to look at next is appreciated., Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 12:21 am -04:00,When I remove the abs function tests fail as follows:>>> time_to_utc(+0 12.0)12.0>>> time_to_utc(+1 12.0)13.0>>> time_to_utc(-11 18.0)19.0>>> time_to_utc(-1 0.0)23.0>>> time_to_utc(-1 0.0)23.0>>> time_to_utc(-1 23.0)0.0, Resolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 3:16 pm -04:00,TamaraI used the abs function because I subtracted time from utc_offset (utc_offset - time) instead of subtracting utc_offset from time (time - utc_offset). If you do the math you will see that utc_offset - time can equal a negative number. Using the abs function got rid of the negative for me plus it passed all the tests.As Jose pointed out I didnt have to do it that way. I was making the problem more complicated than needed., Resolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 12:16 am -04:00,Something else I should add: When I run the a1_guy.py it appears to me to work as expected. I checked times against the time zones in Los Angeles New York and Johannesburg (South Africa) and it gave me the right times., Resolved,0
