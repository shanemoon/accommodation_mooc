Monday September 30th 2013 1:03 am -04:00,What Ive been trying to do throughout the course is actually AVOIDING doing the exercises by typing all the codes provided in the python shell and checking the results (unless there is a command weve never seen before) and although I have no programming experience Ive been getting great results. If you havent yet I suggest that you go back to the exercises and take your time to understand what is going on just by looking at the code. Dont use the visualizer or anything and see if you can predict the results. I believe this studying strategy will be very helpful for programming courses.Â This week it took me a while to get through those nested loops but was worth it. Once you get to understand what is going on by just looking at the code and thinking about it the assignments get much easier., Unresolved,0
