Monday August 26th 2013 1:41 pm -04:00,You just have to type dance floor or dancefloorIf you want to print than you have to type print(dancefloor) to dance floor. I dont know how to use print for dancefloor you can just type print(dancefloor)If you want you can type dance+floor and Python will give you dancefloor, Unresolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 1:57 pm -04:00,In the lesson we learned that an example like that would give nonetype because its a print instead of a return so why does Python give us the result 4 instead of nonetype?Trung Tran I think you have an error in your example... it should be result = sum(1 3) right?, Unresolved,3
Monday August 26th 2013 1:54 pm -04:00,When I try to do a docstring like the example in the lesson I get an error when trying to save the file saying inconsistent use of tab and spaces in indentationthis is my example:def area(base height):        (number number) -> number        Return the area of a triangle with dimensions base and height.        	return base * height / 2def perimeter(side1 side2 side3):    return side1 + side2 + side3, Unresolved,0

Monday August 26th 2013 7:34 pm -04:00,You are complicating too much. For example in the previous exercise you had max(area(xy) area(wz)). Max and area are two functions you used the function max to tell you which area was the biggest.Now in the last exercise you have a temperature from an american city in Fahrenheit degrees and a corresponding function named usa_city_temperature and a function named convert_to_celsius to convert fahrenheit degrees to celsius degrees.Think about this and try to do it. Remember: you just need to type one expression!, Unresolved,1

Friday August 30th 2013 6:16 pm -04:00,Use always 3800 seconds as an example. How many hours are 3800 seconds? 3800 seconds should give you x hours y minutes and z seconds right? If you can reach the right hour and right minutes you should reach the right seconds too because it is the simplest one!Yeah in Portugal we have this ~ but my name is like Juan in Spanish, Resolved,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 4:54 pm -04:00,The point of this exercise is for us to learn about indices and double indices only. If you look carefully to what I have said before the answer is right there. Or you can just see the video lecture again and do the same thing., Resolved,0
