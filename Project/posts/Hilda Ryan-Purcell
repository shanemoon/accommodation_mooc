Saturday October 5th 2013 5:15 am -04:00,I was getting stressed about various different modules being imported at different stages of the course - and wondering would I remember them and what functions belonged to what modules - but now I have just discovered Python module index and they are all there (math str tkinter etc.) (All programmes->Python v3.3.2->Python Manuals->Python module index (see left side of screen)...voilá!!, Pinned Approved Resolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 11:40 am -04:00,I wasnt actually referring to that but that is equally good ( I was referring to the Python 3.3 that we initially downloaded at the beginning of the course), Pinned Approved Resolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 1:42 pm -04:00,I have the very same expression as the instigator of this discussion - and it works for me too - every time. Why is it then marked as wrong? Can staff come in on this one?, Resolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 1:48 pm -04:00,Oops sorry. My expression is as follows:s1.find((s2) s1.find (s2)+1)This does work for me every time - why is it marked as wrong??, Resolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 1:55 pm -04:00,Oh - Ive just got an email as follows ref the above:that code should be fine. the problem is the extra brackets probably dont match the answer that is expected and the programme that processes the answer probably doesnt parse away the extra pair of brackets....So PLEASE someone can you get my mark back as Ive now used up all my 5 attempts!!!, Resolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 8:01 am -04:00,Im glad that you finally figured out what you did wrong (the brackets) but if you have used your 5 tries Im afraid thats it. You dont get more chances. Everyone gets 5 tries. At least you know the right answer now. Good luck. -....But my point is that even though there was an extra bracket in the expression the expression worked and produced the desired result every time. The same expression was included in my 5th attempt at the homework - so it should have been marked as correct. Would you not agree?? (is it not actually a fault of the programme that corrects the answers?), Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 6:24 pm -04:00,Whether its brackets or spaces the code worked in python shell.Is it mentioned anywhere in the training that unless we get the code absolutely correct (spaces brackets etc.) - whether it works on python or not - marks will not be given. I think this would be very much worth alerting to students., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 7:44 pm -04:00,Fair enough. I will have a look. Thanks., Resolved,1

Saturday October 5th 2013 6:06 am -04:00,I feel Im doing something very basically wrong somewhere.

Saturday October 5th 2013 11:48 am -04:00,Thanks very much for that. I will have to come back to it later.I am now doing the Assignment 3 and cant even get passed the first bit - getting very stressed.Can you tell me if I just use If word is not in word list return false else return true? I keep getting a beep and a message saying that return is outside function..all seems so simple and cant think what Im doing wrong ...not much time left for this!Im sure youre tired of helping me at this stage!, Unresolved,0
