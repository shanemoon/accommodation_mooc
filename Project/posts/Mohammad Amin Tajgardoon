Thursday October 3rd 2013 7:03 pm -04:00,I made the same mistake I was just curious about the timing and number of questions. But I didnt know the timer would not stop! Now after a few days I see there is no time left for attempting the exam! I was completely ready for it at that time however; I didnt have time at the moment. Unfortunately I started the course a bit late and this exam was important for me to get the cert.If you count my late submissions in which I gained complete score on first attempts I wouldnt be worried about final exam.Thanks, Resolved,0
