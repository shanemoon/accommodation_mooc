Thursday August 29th 2013 11:22 am -04:00,Im trying to define a function that returns a text when the input in a previous question is a certain answer but I keep getting syntax errors.>>> choice_alarm=input(Do you prefer day(1) or night(2)?)Do you prefer day(1) or night(2)?1>>> def alarm_hour(choice_alarm):	if choice_alarm=1:		SyntaxError: invalid syntax= sign colored red.Apparently Python doesnt expect a conditional where a determined parameter points to a certain string.What am I doing wrong? How could I do this?, Resolved,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 2:19 pm -04:00,I propose to use the title of the post (Challenging Exercises Series (Post Week[weeks material required]) for all the exercises that use all the content seen at a certain time but come up with a bigger difficulty than the seen in the official exercises. This will make the search for this specific difficulty much easier.If the proposed exercise requires a bit more of information about Python it must be explained in the op.Required knowledgeConditions: Conditions are orders that are only followed If the specified conditions are met. To specify a condition you must write if [condition]: and the orders in the next line. After the orders else: must be written along with the orders to be followed If the conditions are not met in the next line.For example:if area<20:    area=area+10else:    area=area+5If the parameter area is less than 20 its value will increase by 10. If not it will increase by 5.ExerciseThe exercise is to create a function custom_round(xy) that rounds the first parameter up to the digit in the position defined by the second parameter. If the last digit is 5 or bigger the previous digit must be increased by 1. You cant call the function round for this purpose.For example:>>> custom_round(354.232)400.0>>> custom_round(84.360)84.0>>> custom_round(0.0032862736-5)0.00329CherryFor the purpose of self-improvement you should try to write most of the function body before the return statement so you can write functions fellow programmers have an easier time understanding when reading.,None,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 9:27 pm -04:00,Just found the syllabus. Dumb of me. Guess my only doubt is If the team is going to work on a course for further material.,None,0
