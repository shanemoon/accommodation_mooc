Monday August 19th 2013 6:18 am -04:00,I have an issue with my Linux notebook when I am trying to install Python. I am currently using Linux Mint. I cant seem to find the right package to install in Package Manager. I have currently installed version 2.7.3 and package manager says that the current version is 2.7.3. It says that this package is a dependency package which depends on Debians default Python version. I cant seem to locate a different version - can anyone help? Thanks!, Resolved,0
