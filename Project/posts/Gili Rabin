Thursday August 29th 2013 7:31 pm -04:00,Hi guys i just wonder if completing the LTP course would help me getting through another Coursera course that called:Programming Handheld Systems with Android (https://www.coursera.org/course/android)Here is what they say about the requirements:Recommended Background This course is directed to Sophomore- or Junior-level undergraduate students. Students should already know how to program in Java but are not expected to have studied mobile application development.Well looks like LTP wont be enough right? i mean we are not learningÂ Jave and wont be like Sophomore- or Junior-level undergraduate. (LTP is my first try of learning to program).Anyway i would love to get suggestions of how i can prepare myself for the android course. by the way there is Java courseRA?Thanks a lot and good luck everybody.
