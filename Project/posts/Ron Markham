Sunday September 1st 2013 3:11 pm -04:00,My two favorite distributions are PythonXY and WinPython in part because they are packaged with Spyder a great IDE which has a similar look and feel to Matlab.Â  Unfortunately PythonXY is not currently packaged with Python 3.x; however WinPython is and it can also be installed in a portable fashion if desired.http://code.google.com/p/winpython/https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/, Resolved,1
