Monday August 26th 2013 1:06 am -04:00,Yes you are right. My mistake. I really havent ment the interface I ment the view of the program.I learned only Java and C++ and Im not familiar to other progamming languages so its hard for me to think is Python similar to them or not., Resolved,0

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:18 pm -04:00,Thank you for your reply. Ive already remarked some differences in Java C++ and Python but you have mentioned some more. Sorry I havent ment interface. Ive only used the wrong term. Actually I ment the appearance of different languages. Python is very easy to use and thats why I like it very much., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:29 pm -04:00,Hello everyone!Actually Python for me is not the first programming language. I have already rearn Java and C++. These three languages are object-oriented so they all are very similar.I like Python because of its simplicity and ease of understanding. I am not sure what for I will use it but probably trading is one of the reasons for me to learn this language.What do you think of Python?,None,0
