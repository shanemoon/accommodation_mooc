Sunday September 15th 2013 12:10 pm -04:00,I think you dont understand. Last time (with assignment 1) I had to wait a while before my code was accepted but when it finaly worked I got some information like Your code have been accepted or something like this. Now I dont get anything. My file just dissapears and I guess it wont be accepted any time., Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 10:58 am -04:00,Hi.This is part of the code from Developing a Program lecture:1.import tkinter.filedialog2.a1_filename=tkinter.filedialog.askopenfilename()3.a1_file=open(a1_filenamer)4.for line in a1_file:5.  print(line)I dont understand for what I need variable a1_file. When I run the code without 3th line .txt file is printed even if I use .askopenfile instead of askopenfilename.To be clear:1.import tkinter2.a1_filename=tkinter.filedialog.askopenfile()4.for line in a1_filename:5.   print(line)It works. , Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 3:34 pm -04:00,Hm.In the first case variable  a1_filename is str but in the second one the same variable is _io.TextIOWrapper  so exactly what in the first case variable a1_file was. Im confused. , Unresolved,1
Thursday October 3rd 2013 5:36 pm -04:00,Most of my problems were interpreting the instructions rather than deciding how to code it.Right!For ...contains_word.. I wrote codes which returns true or value  if word can be built with characters from first or from second list. It was little bit harder than write correct functions but all of them works perfectly ;) , Unresolved,0
