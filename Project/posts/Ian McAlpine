Sunday September 1st 2013 2:09 pm -04:00,Hello AnonymousIts time to relax. You are over-thinking the problem. Also the instructions are completely correct. As you say And had also read the following PRECONDITION to function to_24_hour_clock():Precondition: hours >= 0 So that precondition applies *only* to the to_24_hour_clock() function not any other function and only to the hour parameter in that function.But in the time_from_utc() functions why do you think the utc_offset parameter (eg -7 or -1) has anything to do with the hour parameter in to_24_hour_clock()? They are both completely different!You need to code the time_from_utc() and time_to_utc() functions so that when you call to_24_hour_clock() you pass in a value for hour >= 0.Its easier than you might think and can be done with one return statement.RegardsIan, Pinned Resolved,5
