Thursday August 22nd 2013 1:28 pm -04:00,I thought I understood the n_digit argument with your first example because moving left from 41 would give us 40 but then the next example has me totally flummoxed. How did 245 get rounded to 250 shouldnt it have been 244?Im pathetic at math so please forgive me if this turns out be a trouble with math instead of trouble with programming!, Resolved,0

Thursday August 22nd 2013 1:39 pm -04:00,Dear Alberto Like the Anonymouss helpful answer before yours I almost understood what you were saying but then I got confused again when you wrote 5**5 is 125. Isnt it 3125? But anyway I typed 3125%8 and got 5. So I know how you got 10 and therefore 10.13. But I still dont understand how and why to use the % sign.   , Resolved,0
