Wednesday August 28th 2013 9:22 pm -04:00,As I peruse the questions about Assignment 1 that have been asked in this discussion forum so far Im struck by how much more complicated other peoples solutions seemingly are versus the solutions I came up with. So I thought Id offer some helpful advice to those fellow students who might be struggling because frankly theyre making the problems harder than they need to be.The instructions state plainly Each function body will be quite short. This is true. Indeed each one of my function bodies is just a single statement.All the user-defined functions can be written without using any built-in functions.Theres nothing in the instructions about needing to round or truncate any numbers explicitly.The key to solving several of the problems is to use exactly the right arithmetic operator.There are 60 seconds in a minute and 3600 seconds in an hour. These values are constants. It isnt necessary to compute the number of seconds in an hour within any user-defined functions.In the Preface the instructors explain that [a] problem domain is an area of expertise that needs to be understood in order to solve a problem. … Every assignment in this course will have a problem domain that you will need to learn about. To write the functions for Assignment 1 you really dont have to know any more about time zones and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) than is explained in the Preface. As it happens its more important to know simple time arithmetic—the kind you learned in grade school.Remember the KISS principle.I hope this advice is helpful. I suppose if it is or isnt will be reflected by the vote tally you see below.JimUPDATE (2013-08-30 00:40 UTC): Also check out my post titled Helpful Resource: Fun With Modular Arithmetic. , Pinned Resolved,130
Wednesday August 28th 2013 9:44 pm -04:00,I think the minimum possible number of function body statements is eight because there are eight total functions to write for Assignment 1:seconds_difference()hours_difference()to_float_hours()get_hours()get_minutes()get_seconds()time_to_utc()time_from_utc()Jim, Pinned Resolved,8

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:59 am -04:00,To me it seems clear that the instructors intention for Assignment 1 is to teach us how to use modular arithmetic to solve a common type of computer programming problem in the most usual familiar and idiomatic way. Modular arithmetic and Pythons modulo operator % are important subjects of the Week 2 lessons.  Jim  , Pinned Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 8:27 pm -04:00,To complete Assignment 1 successfully you must understand modular arithmetic and Pythons modulo operator (%). Theyre explained in the lectures of course but if youve never used modular arithmetic in the way computer programmers frequently do then you may find it helpful to read a more thorough explanation of the topic. I found a good one on the BetterExplained.com website titled Fun With Modular Arithmetic. It explains clock arithmetic in a very understandable way.You may also find it helpful to read my earlier post in this forum titled Are you struggling with Assignment 1?

Thursday September 5th 2013 11:52 pm -04:00,To arrange the IDLE Edit and Shell windows side by side in Microsoft Windows Vista or Windows 7 open them both right-click an empty area of the taskbar then click Show Windows Side by Side. The window thats currently selected or is otherwise in focus will be placed on the left and the other window will be placed on the right. When you do this only the two IDLE windows Edit and Shell may be open and not minimized; all other open windows must be minimized.Doing this may be second nature to many seasoned Windows users but it wasnt to me. I had to google how to do it. I found the Microsoft webpage titled Manage multiple windows. On Windows 7 this same side-by-side arrangement can be achieved using Snap. The webpage explains how to do this.Jim, Resolved,6

Monday September 9th 2013 10:51 pm -04:00,Dawn Youre right: s[0] is an example of simple string indexing.

Tuesday September 10th 2013 2:13 am -04:00,I agree with you Anthony. Naturally and intuitively nothingness is not a valid DNA sequence. I returned False if the DNA sequence was an empty string and the grader marked it incorrect. About the zero-length DNA sequence the grader explicitly says It should be valid. Uh OK.As you noted the instructions are vague:The parameter is a potential DNA sequence. Return True if and only if the DNA sequence is valid (that is it contains no characters other than A T C and G).Fixing the error was as simple as removing the offending if...return block.Jim, Resolved,8
Tuesday September 10th 2013 3:16 pm -04:00,Its importance is in the lesson it teaches us about software engineering in the real world. Specifications and expectations are very often out of tune. Specifications tend to be vague while expectations are usually concrete., Resolved,6
Thursday September 12th 2013 4:03 am -04:00,Sure. But if you implement the solution in a particular way then you dont have to test for the empty string explicitly. The empty string is just included among the default cases for which the Boolean value returned by the function is True. The default    case is defined as any string consisting solely of zero or more occurrences of the characters A T C and G.In my opinion this is the simplest most elegant implementation. Inspect each character (nucleotide) in the string (DNA sequence) in turn from first to last. If the character is not one of A T C or G then return False immediately short-circuiting    the needless inspection of any more characters. Otherwise after inspecting all the (valid) characters in the string return True., Resolved,3
Thursday September 12th 2013 8:24 pm -04:00,It would have been clearer and resulted in less confusion among the students if the Assignment 2 instructions had stated plainly The empty string  is a valid DNA sequence. Let us stipulate this painfully obvious fact. Those who insist that the instructions are crystal clear and unambiguous are mistaken. This is also quite obvious from the mere existence of this and at least one other lengthy thread in the discussion forum. Now to the heart of the matter. Is it wrong to regard nothingness (i.e. the empty string) as a valid DNA sequence? The answer is unequivocally it depends.In the case of a DNA sequence in the natural world its seems obvious even to someone like me who knows very little about biology that a DNA sequence must consist of something if it is to be considered a viable DNA sequence. So let us also stipulate this obvious fact of biology.But a computer program is a kind of model of something in the natural world; its not the thing itself. And computer programs very often must allow for small accommodations—fudges—at the boundaries of the model just to make things work.Heres a simple example albeit perhaps a silly one. In the real world theres no such thing as a college class with no students in it. If no one exists to learn then no education can possibly occur. Therefore the definition of a college class includes an assumption of one or more students. But a computer program that models college classes professors students grades etc. will nonetheless allow a variable named say number_of_students_in_class to refer to the value 0. Indeed it will probably always have the initial value 0 because in the model the college class will exist before any students are enrolled in it. Youd be stuck with a real dilemma if the count of the number of students enrolled in the class (in the model of the class) could never be 0. It would be unworkable.Hopefully Ive made it easier for you to imagine a reason why in a computer program an empty string might be a valid value for something like a DNA sequence as a simple expedient.Jim, Resolved,15

Your question about how to fold blocks in Notepad++ has nothing to do either with the topic of this thread or with Assignment 2 specifically. You should ask your question about the text editor youre using elsewhere not here.

Tuesday September 24th 2013 5:54 pm -04:00,Thats not an answer to the question Krzysztof asked Anonymous. He asked what the output should properly be if a word thats in the word list is on the board two or more times. Its a question about an edge case one can reasonably expect to occur on any given board.The answer Krzysztof is that…num_words_on_board([[AN] [NA]] [AN])…should return 1 not 2. We can infer this from the implementation of the function board_contains_word_in_row() which was kindly written for us by the instructors. It returns the Boolean value True upon finding the first instance of word. It doesnt return a count of the numbers of occurrences of word on board. Similarly your implementation of the corresponding function board_contains_word_in_column() must return a Boolean value not an integer (i.e. not a count of occurrences).Jim, Resolved,2
