Sunday September 1st 2013 7:38 pm -04:00,I get the same error only that one on the test. When I write that code I get:>>> get_hours(300800)83I know the hours should vary from 0 to 23. I put a precondition that the seconds should be from 0 to 82800 but that is just a description and doesnt limit the variable. Can you tell me where I made a mistake?ThanksEDIT: I found my mistake now :) Just looked at it better :)>>> get_hours(300800)11, Resolved,0
