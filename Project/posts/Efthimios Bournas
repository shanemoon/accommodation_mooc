Tuesday August 20th 2013 3:48 am -04:00,For MAC OS users:You can look at Alexander Falguis comment above but instead of options you go: IDLE/Preferences after starting the IDLE application or simply by the shortcut ⌘ ,None,1
Tuesday August 20th 2013 4:11 am -04:00,Olivia i am not sure about the cause of your problem but if i were you:1. I would make sure that i downloaded the Tcl/Tk (ActiveTcl) properly (taking good care of the compatibility issues (e.g. for Mac OS 10.5 of 64-bit and Python version 2.7.5 -> use ActiveTcl 8.5.14 etc). Download the Tcl/Tk in this link: http://www.python.org/getit/mac/tcltk/2. If nothing happens uninstall/re-install all the Python application package.Unfortunately i cant offer you any pro help. Try make a different more targeted thread if you still have problem with it.,None,0
