Sunday September 15th 2013 10:47 am -04:00,yes I have been having the same problem. All the fuctions have been tested separated and they are OK when I tested but not when I sumit itThe first time I got 17/24 then I added one line of code correcting an error then I am getting 0/24 ever since since yesterday. I summitted 4 times today and finally I decided to start over with a fresh a2.py file and typed very carefully with all the spaces and gotten again 0/24. The same kind of error for all the functions : ERROR: AttributeError. ReplacerModule object has no attribute, Unresolved,0
