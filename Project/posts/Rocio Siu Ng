Tuesday October 1st 2013 11:26 pm -04:00,I found the lectures on Reading Files to have incomplete information in my opinion. While they fully explain how objects like strings and lists are treated and manipulated in python they only gloss over these components for files.  Personally I think this made the last part of the assignment more challenging than it should have been.  It is likely that my methods for completing it were not what they had intended. , Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 11:12 pm -04:00,I think the nature of the assignment/game assumes a board with columns that are all the same length.  The number of rows can vary in any way.  i could be wrong but this way of thinking seemed to work for the assignment, Resolved,0
