Monday August 26th 2013 11:43 pm -04:00,Lets say I have these 3 numbers: 4 + 7 * 6 In python the calculations will be 7 * 6 which is 42. Then it will add 42 with 4 to get 46.But I wanted the addition to be done first. So what can I do?If I enclose the 4 + 7 in parenthesis like this: (4 + 7) * 6I will be telling python to do that first so that we now get:11 * 6which then comes to 66., Unresolved,6

Thursday September 5th 2013 1:45 am -04:00,As a newbie programmer I think the more advanced OOP concepts are a bit overwhelming. With that said I took that course in its first offering. It is not easy. It is a great course and I recommend everyone to take it but I would not say that it is a good course to take after this one the learning curve is extremely steep. I didnt actually get to finish the course and I plan on taking it again.,None,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 1:01 am -04:00,I just ran your code and I have no problems getting the function to load from my inputs. Do you get any errors or a blank space when you try it?,None,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 2:26 am -04:00,Ok let me see if I can explain this.### combat.pyimport random loads The standard random module implements a random number generator.    Usage is simple:    import random    print random.random()    This prints a random floating point number in the    range [0 1) (that is between 0 and 1 including 0.0 but always    smaller than 1.0).    There are also many other specialized generators in this module such as:    randrange(a b) chooses an integer in the range [a b).    uniform(a b) chooses a floating point number in the range [a b).            def combat(player_num computer_num):    (intint) -> str    Return you hit!!oryour attack was blocked!oryou missed    depending on the values in (player_num computer_num)    >>>> combat(105)    you hit !!    >>>> combat(77)    your hit was blocked !    >>>> combat(48)    you missed !        if player_num > computer_num:        return(you hit!!)    elif player_num == computer_num:        return(your attack was blocked!)    else:        return(you missed)     ## >>>combat(random.randrange(112) random.randrange(110))    ## this is an example function call to combat() using the    ## standard random module. def call():    action = input(what game do you want to play?  a or b >)    if action == a:        return combat(random.randrange(112) random.randrange(110))    if action == b:        return myFunctionB()         def myFunctionB():   print(myFunctionB was called)call() If you were to run that code you would get that issue you were talking about mainly because like Tom said you are returning the function call. If you want it to show the information you would have to have the functions output stored before being printed.instead of having the call() function running you could change the last lines of code tomainCall = call()print(mainCall)this will store the combat() functions value to then be printed.Note: the code formatting got screwed so dont actually try to run this code.,None,1
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:24 pm -04:00,youre trying to run the seconds_difference() function which should have its argument (the 3600.0) in these ().So itll look like this return (seconds_difference(3600.0 1800.0)), Resolved,2
Tuesday September 10th 2013 1:16 pm -04:00,But in the 2 step I must write the function get_lenght. And where should I embed len here? I dont know...If you did assignment 1 then you should know how to do this. Try using a return statement, Unresolved,2
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:12 pm -04:00,there is probably  a test case you havent considered that is failing. You said you have a if statements and for loops I was able to write the function without the use of any of that so the error may be happening in that part of the code., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:14 pm -04:00,Your code is a clever illusion. It works for the tests given by pure coincidence but all you are doing is shifting the letters. Try testing it with AAA you should get TTT but with your code youll just get AAA again.EDIT: Actually it looks like you wrote the tests after you wrote the code which of course would make the tests right!, Resolved,3

Wednesday September 11th 2013 1:16 pm -04:00,Im starting this thread in hopes of helping others to study and get better at programming. I also hope others will contribute.I only have one as of right now but I might come up with more later.Paper and Pencil: I dont know about the rest of you but I like to work out the problems with a good ol fashioned paper and pencil. I feel that it helps me think more freely because I have the freedom to scribble anything anywhere without constraints. One can also use it to organize any variables functions expressions etc... needed for solving the problem.Redundant code: If you find yourself writing code that looks like if (a == a) :return Trueelse:return FalseThen there is probably a less redundant way of writing it such asreturn a == aIf the code works you dont have to worry about changing it until you find yourself with extra time so dont panic if you cant make code less redundant immediately!Rubber duck debugging: I love this one. Essentially when something is wrong with your code you have to debug it. This technique is pretty much explaining out loud to no one in particular and in terms that a child could understand how the code is supposed to work line by line. The idea is that as youre explaining the code youll run into the problem code and wont be able to explain it until you fix it (presumably you cant explain code that doesnt behave how want it to.)Study other code: Whenever you can its best to look at other peoples code and study it. The python module pygame which is free to download allows for making games easier. More importantly people will submit their games and anyone can download the code and see how it works and being used!,None,1
Friday September 13th 2013 12:04 am -04:00,Tinkering: This can be done in any language but its easier and faster to use a language such as python ruby racket etc... for immediate feedback. The point is to just type out code and see what works and what doesnt work. This is helpful in learning the behaviors of the language as well as how it prints errors and other messages.,None,1
Sunday September 15th 2013 2:06 pm -04:00,Read the Documentation: As boring this may be one can always learn about the language they are working in by reading the documentation for it. The library reference will help anyone familiarize themselves with any functions the language comes with avoiding creating similar functions out of ignorance. Also if theres a language specification (which might be even dryer than reading the documentation) that can also help one understand the language its quirks and why it was created.,None,0
