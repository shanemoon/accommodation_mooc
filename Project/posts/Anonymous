Friday August 23rd 2013 8:36 am -04:00,Hopefully the second course starts sometime soon after this one!  Ill definitely look into it.  Theres also An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python which starts in October.Thanks also for the suggestion of the Princeton algorithm courses!  The first one starts today so now Im enrolled.  Also thanks for telling me about Crypto I.  I swear I looked a couple days ago and it didnt have another session until next year.  I enrolled at the end of the last crypto I session with only 5 days left and ended up just downloading all the video lectures homeworks etc. and planned to try and get through them and take Crypto II.  But this is perfect!  Also theres two different certificates one with and one without programming knowledge so you dont have to complete the programming assignments.  Although Id assume doing the coding would make everything 100x easier :) Ill still attempt it even if I pass out from exhaustion during week 2.Now for my recs:*Theres crypto-textbook.org with a free pdf textbook and accompaning video lectures that looks pretty good.  *A course on Udacity called Applied Cryptology that doesnt look as good as this one here although I havent watched it yet.  *Theres also StevesLectures on Youtube (CSS322 Lecture 1 09 Nov 2012) that looks interesting.  Ive watch the first lecture and a bit of the second so far and it explains things pretty well although it goes pretty slow lots of pauses in his talking etc.  Thats more of a security course that focuses on crypto rather than straight crypto.  *Two itunes podcasts: Information Security Encyclopedia and Multimedia im Netz - WiSe 2010/2011 that I downloaded but havent even looked at yet.  They dont look as good as some of the stuff here however I havent listened to them yet so Im not really sure*Theres also this book: http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/ that seems to be pretty standard reading material (Ive seen the picture pop of everywheres when I was looking for a good crypto textbook to read) however here its provided for free (legally).,None,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 10:00 pm -04:00,Dear Jennifer and PaulThank you. This course should be an example to other universities on how a computer course should be taught. Your step by step explanations demystify concepts and makes the process easy enjoyable and removes the frustrations which other lecturers delight in leaving for students to solve. I did a course in C++ where the loading of the shell was not explained. I hated programming (except in Matlab) and now love it because of this course. The ease of programming is masked by the lack of ability of most computer science lecturers.BTW University of Waterloo is also good. This displays Canadian excellence in education. (I am from Africa but in Australia to demonstrate there is no bias.)Thank you again. By the way I never post on these forums but was motivated to do so by your excellence in teaching., Resolved,5

Monday August 19th 2013 9:12 am -04:00,Software development is a form of art for which one must have an aptitude. Almost anyone can be taught how to program but only a limited subset of those taught will be good programmers. An ability to think in a logical structured manner is something I would consider a requirement tho it must be balanced by the ability to step away and also see the big picture. Someone with the ability to move between both the bottom-up (i.e. a code-jockey) and the top-down worlds is often known as a software engineer. ,None,3
Monday August 19th 2013 7:34 am -04:00,What Ive found is that youre more likely to continue beyond the basics if you have a goal in mind of what you would like to do.  Are you interested in robotics?  Well youre going to have to know a thing or two about programming micro-controllers.  Are you interested in building your own mobile apps?  Are you interested in building and manipulating 3D models?  Are you interested in Algorithms and Data Structures?  Do you want to build software or perhaps web applications?  Maybe youre interested in artificial intelligence.  Fortunately for us all the fundamentals of programming in all of these different areas are universal and when it comes to actually building that foundation you need only a few different sources.After getting your feet wet with the language youll start to see for yourself the relationships between fields such as logic mathematics physics computer science and every other hard-science.  To be a scientist or musician or philosopher is to learn to think procedurally and that is at the core of what being a programmer is all about.We all have at our finger-tips millions of times more processing power than all of the super-powers in the world combined during the 70s.  Use it and use it well.EDIT: Dont listen to people who say you need to know all about mathematics before you start programming.  Mathematics is an ideological framework.  If you dont have that framework learn everything you can about programming and then use it as a framework to view and understand mathematics.  Its all about perspective and understanding/expressing ideas in new ways.,None,3
Monday August 19th 2013 7:56 am -04:00,To be a programmer you need to think logically & have good problem solving skills so being able to understand abstractions is very useful. You also need a good attention to detail.Some areas of programming require more maths than others. Commercial programming may not require anything more than the basics like dealing with your local currency. Other areas like Cryptography require more maths but then you dont have to know all the maths behind Cryptography to use the tools that have been built by those that do.

Monday August 19th 2013 9:30 am -04:00,If youre developing code for application (e.g. scientific research economics) where theres heavy math involved then itd help to also be strong in math so that you can better understand what youre developing and validate the results. That said most of the heavy-lifting has already been done long ago and you can find libraries for almost anything.

Some people like to learn languages on the fly while working on a larger project. My guess would be to like Jen says just work with it often.... And oh yeah math and CS go hand-in-hand.

You need to understand the principles about programming in one language very well and then these can be adopted to new languages very easily. When I say principles I mean things like if and for loops and arrays. 4. also break a task into small fragement like the post below.

Sunday August 18th 2013 11:19 pm -04:00,Im a bit confused (already) why I have to re-enter the area variable definition in order to get a new value or...>>> base = 20>>> height = 12>>> area = base * height / 2>>> area120.0Thats cool. Now lets say one variable changes or:>>> base = 15>>> area120.0Wrong. Likewise if I change both variables. I still need to spell out the area variable definition in order to get the correct result or:>>> base = 15>>> area = base * height / 2>>> areaSo Im guessing that since the area variable calculates the value at the time of its definition regardless if the related values are redefined later on in the code that this is a prime reason to use a function area which uses as parameters base and height so that these values can be changed on the fly and the result will be accurate...Or am I missing something?, Resolved,0
Sunday August 18th 2013 11:41 pm -04:00,Thank you. That helps me to understand that it is a value as in one value that is stored in area instead of base * height / 2   So when defining something that will have changing values if makes sense to instead define a function so that the formula is retained even when the parameters change.

Sunday August 25th 2013 12:20 pm -04:00,Given a string of length one it returns an integer representing the Unicode codevalue of the character when the argument is a unicode object or the value ofthe byte when the argument is an 8-bit string that is its ASCII value. For example ord(a) returnsthe integer 97 ord(u\u2020) returns 8224.  This is the inverse ofchr() for 8-bit strings and of unichr() for unicode objects. An example of where it might be used would be very basic Cryptography for example a Caesar cipher where each letter is substituted by another so for example A becomes N B becomes O etc. To perform the encryption or decryption we convert each letter to its ord & then add or subtract a fixed value then turn it back into the required value with chr()., Resolved,3

Monday August 19th 2013 10:58 am -04:00,The section of memory where the code resides is separate from the section of memory where the actual values reside (lets call this place the heap). The length of a pointer to a memory location is always the same but the size of the value stored at that memory location can vary significantly from an int to a string. While the amount of memory consumed by code is fixed the allocation of the heap can change continuously - particularly since when you change a variable you dont overwrite the old value but instead a new bit of the heap is used.  Example: If you type a=5 whats stored in a is a pointer to a memory location (lets call it heap_slot_a) containing 5. If you then type a=6 a new memory location is allocated (e.g. heap_slot_b) 6 is put in that location and then that new memory location is stored in a. What happens to heap_slot_a is that the garbage collector running behind the scenes manages the heap allocations and periodically cleans up the unused locations and returns them to the heap.I hope this helps :-), Approved Resolved,39
Monday August 19th 2013 3:03 pm -04:00,Many languages (e.g. Ada Pascal C C++ C# and others) have strong typing which requires all variables to be declared as a specific type (int char float etc.) prior to use. Some also let you define variables as static which means that value cannot be changed (similar to a Python tuple). The advantages to both of these characteristics are many including better memory management faster compilation smaller code and faster execution. A strongly-typed language requires more discipline on the part of the developer (finding a missing brace {} in many nested blocks of C can be less than fun unless using a good IDE) but can also result in code thats easier to read troubleshoot and modify. Loosely-typed languages (e.g. Python) can be a lot easier to learn and writing programs can be faster but they can also lead to sloppy programming and create unexpected output thats hard to troubleshoot. Even when Ive written code in loosely-typed languages Ive named my variables so that I know the type just by looking at the name (e.g. sFirstName intAge fSalary etc.)., Approved Resolved,5

Monday August 19th 2013 3:42 pm -04:00,Programs are read top to bottom and assignment is made to the variable on the left of the equal sign not the right.  y=z+1 retrieves the value which z is referencing (10) adds 5 to this value and stoz the results in the memory location to which y is referring. After this statement has been executed its gone - Python has moved on to the next statement. z=10 means that the value to which z had been referring 5 is no longer in use. A new value is put in memory 10 and now z points to this value., Resolved,1

It holds a pointer (or reference) to the value. The value is stored elsewhere. id() actually obtains the location of value that is pointed (or referred to) by the variable. So when you change the value the memory location has changed. The garbage collector built into Python will collected the previous value allocated in memory if it is no longer referenced by any variable., Resolved,1

Saturday August 31st 2013 4:34 pm -04:00,x is a variable. And 5 is a value.  The number 5 is stored in a memory address.  x = 5 means that the variable x then points to the memory address of 5.  the value 10 is stored in a different memory address. with the expression x=10 then you change the memory address that the variable x points to.  So you do not have two values for x.  There is only one value for x which is 10.  It is not overwritten the variable x just points to a different memory address when the expression is evaluated., Pinned Approved Resolved,1

Friday August 23rd 2013 12:44 am -04:00,You would have to use a programming language that allows you to manage the memory. For instance like the video said in languages like C there are things called pointers which can be used to point to the address locations and then finally dereferenced to obtain the value the pointer is pointing to. For example in C you would use the & sign in front of the variable to indicate that you want the address the variable is stored in. Basically it is confusing complicated stuff that is not needed in modern programming languages like python that automatically manage the memory for you. , Resolved,1

Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:15 am -04:00,The solution might not be 100% in their hands. Well considering the restrictions in china on video and other social network content streamed from outside china it might not be possible for coursera / or others to do much about it. A lot of such material that is not hosted on chinese server is not available to chinese people. It is not as easy as uploading a video on youku. It might not be legally economically or technically feasible for coursera to go for a better host in china. So till there is a huge demand for it in china it is always advisable for people like us to just buy a simple vpn connection and solve our problem. There are thousands of other web content that are not available to us in china and for that we have to look for the solution. As coursera is not a new website if it was possible for them to do that they would have done it long time back. I had seen this problem even a year back and there must be many people in every other course who must have reported this problem. As still it is not solved it is clear that it is not possible for them to do that., Resolved,-1

Saturday August 24th 2013 4:48 pm -04:00,Fellow students good eveningfirst i wanna thank you again for your participation.I think the two answers that most of us used to solve the problem are:1. the recursive function (the one that calls itself) the code i used was:import timestart_time = time.time()def fib(n):    if n < 2:        return n    return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)print (fib(30))print (Computed in: time.time() - start_time  seconds)2. the build a list of all the elements up to required function. Here i experimenteda little using list comprehensions and the code i used was:import timestart_time = time.time()def fib(n):    fib =     [fib.append(fib[-1]+fib[-2]) if i>1 else fib.append(i) for i in range(n)]    return fibprint fib(2501)print Computed in: time.time() - start_time  secondsAnd although the second seems to make more computations the timing resultsproove the opposite. In my test machine (an old eeePC 4G surf):1. the first program took about 2.65 seconds to find the 30th fibonacci element2. the second took about 2.55 seconds to compute the list of the first 2500fibonacci elements.

Different types require different amounts of memory to store. Different functions require different types as parameters and may return values of different types.

For instance:strMyFirstName = Michael <- this is validx = abs(strMyFirstName) <- this is not valid becuase there is no absolute value for Michael and the function requires a number.There are too many functions to memorize but youll want to know where to find them and how to use them., Resolved,3

Sunday August 25th 2013 5:05 am -04:00,Correct - data_list[argv[2]] is invalid.

Monday August 26th 2013 2:19 am -04:00,Hi RomanI know Java though still just on the level of a student. I also know some C and C++ so I think I know enough to give you a reasonable answer.There are two aspects I want to go into: The languages themselves and the interface.a) The languages are actually very similar. There is a simple reason for this: Like C++ and Python Java is object-orientated. (This means much more then just to be able to structurize a software into modules that (in Java Python and C++) ar called classes. Still if you read introductions to software engineering the term module can refer to either classes or functions. The term method is equal to the term funtion. Still there are differences but those wont be important to understand how to program a function or a method.) There is yet another reason for the similarity: When Java was developed there was the idea to do it in a way that made it easy for C++ developers to adept the new language.Then there are differences: If you develop a program in C/C++ you can easily do so in a way that the program you develop will only run on similar computers (e.g. Windows computer those with OS X ...) If you develop a program in Java it is rather hard to develop it in a way that wont run on other operating systems.Now from my point of view there is one major difference between Java and Python: In Java you have static types while in Python you have dynamic types. This means that in Java you have to define the type of any variable first. And you cant change a variables type later. Usually when people talk about how they prefer Java to Python (or Ruby which is similar in this regard) or vice versa it is due to this. Both approaches have a certain value as well as a certain disadvantage to the other. In the long run anyone who is active as a computer scientist shouldnt have the slightest problem with either one. (Though that of course takes quite some time.)Now many people think that if they understood how to program in languages like these they have understood anything there is about programming. That is wrong. (Sorry for putting this so straight but actually it is important to at least know that there is a lot more about programming.) Actually there are multiple programming paradigms. One of those is called declarative programming. This is competely different from imperative or object oriented programming. Still for the time being just stick to imperative/object oriented programming as one should best do one at a time.b) About the interface: There is something called IDE (short for integrated development environment). These offer you different tools when you want to develop programms in different languages. (Tools for finding errors tools for checking if your program works in networks tools for supporting you if you are part of a team ...) There are some (like Eclipse or Visual Studio) that support you in developing programs in more than one language. Some are just simple text editors that have been extended by a plug-in. As far as I know IDLE only supports development in Python. Still these IDEs are not the programming language or part of it. They are just to help you programming in that language. (Alas sometimes its pain in the a... to start developing software with one of these... There can be many things you have to define first. In this respect IDLE is one of the best to start with.)I hope knowing this is useful to you and that it wasnt too much.Best regards and have fun learing to programMarkus, Unresolved,1

Monday August 26th 2013 1:05 am -04:00,Generally yes - you should get 2 different memory addresses. However some small commonly used values e.g. 10 are pre-allocated by Python and are never destroyed even if they are never used - theyre immutable. The primary rational behind this behavior is speed - if every time a loop were used Python had to create and destroy an object for each iteration performance would suffer.,None,0
Monday August 26th 2013 3:47 am -04:00,You will get the same memory addresses when the Python memory manager chooses to intern the value and different addresses when it chooses to not intern the value:>>> x=Pedro>>> xPedro>>> id(Pedro)58987328>>> id(x)58987328>>> y=john jones>>> yjohn jones>>> id(john jones)48850928>>> id(y)59105840,None,4

Monday August 26th 2013 7:04 am -04:00,The only answer to that question is that Python is used exclusively in situations where deemed appropriate. Its not really possible to say that Pythons used anywhere exclusively without applying constraints e.g. All programmers in the Acme Inc. Active Directory User Account Administration group use Python exclusively for small tasks e.g. reporting of userIDs with expired passwords when a compiled language would be unnecessary. There are different reasons for choosing different languages or even a mix of languages for a development purpose. In the example I gave the exact same task could also be performed with VBScript for instance. In a MSFT environment it might be even quicker to find that someone else has already written the code in VBscript.,None,0

Monday August 26th 2013 6:23 pm -04:00,Good evening my fellow brothers in python arms.In the second part of out series we are going to write code for creating a Caesar cipher (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) which is the simplest form of cryptography. Another title for it is monoalphabetic substitution.So out task this week is write a function (or two) to encrypt a text message (string) using an integer or string key of a single letter. And another one that takes the encrypted message and the key and produces the original message.The encryption function should take two parameters the simple message and the key (integer or character) and return the encrypted message according to the Caesar cipher.The decryption function takes the encrypted message and the key and returns the decrypted (same as the original) message.I hope you have fun!,None,1

Friday August 30th 2013 5:53 pm -04:00,Hi Etienne Just a small comment regarding your question: May I ask why you guys are sticking to such an historical version of the Caesars Cipher?  When you consider that most of us are probably very basic beginners sometimes with a spot of knowledge or one or two slightly more advanced techniques but over all having only a basic background in Python - a historical cipher with a simple shift method is probably a good challenge for this week - especially considering that were only in week two and week one introduced basic math operators including the modulo which is used in most of our attempts.. Plus - it was the exercise our anonymous classmate suggested which seems as good of a reason as any to focus on it. Just a thought. Diane,None,1

Monday August 26th 2013 6:40 pm -04:00,I am having so much trouble with this last little bit! WARNING - dont copy the code I put here I know its wrong.I tried at first with this: return time - utc_offsetObviously this doesnt work in the cases where the result is larger than 24 such as >>> time_to_utc(-11 18.0)... which returns 29.I figured that what I needed to do was this instead:return time - utc_offset % 24And that works great until I get to >>> time_to_utc(-1 12.0)... which returns -11.0.The only way I can think to do this is with an if statement using the first return statement (return time - utc_offset) and saying that if the result is greater than or equal to 24 then use modulo. However this seems really complicated especially since we havent done conditionals yet.Could someone smarter than me point me in the right direction? Thanks! :), Resolved,0

Tuesday August 27th 2013 7:23 am -04:00,For the assignment you have to call the 24 hour clock.But why you got -11 for time_to_utc(-1 12.) is because you used time -utc_offset %24 which is 12 -23 instead of(time -utc_offset) %24 which is 13% 24, Resolved,0

Tuesday August 27th 2013 5:58 am -04:00,The to_24_hour_clock function is required for times zones which take the UTC = 0 time back to before midnight (one of the examples goes back to 11pm from 8am if I remember correctly) plus in the exercises for the week we were specifically told that if we have a function that already does something we should use that instead of repeating the same code manually every time we want to do a similar task (to avoid errors).I think the to_24_hour_clock was specifically included to get people into a best practice mindset of using existing functions instead of typing the same code over and over to complete a task multiple times., Resolved,0

Tuesday August 27th 2013 8:38 am -04:00,I am not using any print() statements.I tested the function using the python shell. i.e.>>> time_from_utc(+1 12.0) 13.0etc.By the wayI mis-posted above.  It is not the time_to_utc() function but the time_from_utc() function., Unresolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 9:27 am -04:00,Thanks very much much. My code is only the following with the addition of the docstringsdef time_from_utc(utc_offset time):return to_24_hour_clock(utc_offset + time)I am not satisfying the precondition for the to_24_hour_clock() function but since that function only uses return hours % 24 I dont see why that would matter. I am assuming that the % in python can take  negative arguments as in modulo arithmetic and the python shell accepts it., Unresolved,0

It took me far longer to understand what i was supposed to do than actually solve the problem. May be i am a little thick head but i found the instructions a little lacking.

Tuesday August 27th 2013 9:38 pm -04:00,Im in the exact same position except Im no where near done with the assignment there is not that much explanation and the fact that there is no one-on-one communication with instructors is not a good thing but this is a very good course and the material taught in it is phenomenal. The bad part is Im completely new to programming and therefore need help from someone so I understand everything easily which is what I do when learning c# with my friend as he explains to me and is there to answer my questions easily.

Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:30 am -04:00,Perhaps a lot of people got confused about the topic of the thread. When it is mentioned instructions it is not the lectures that is being talked about. That is no doubt wonderful. Very nicely explained. It is the instruction to do assignment on that one page which is not that well arranged as the rest of the teaching material. It could have been arranged a little more systematically so that people from all backgrounds could understand it as well as the lectures. It is also not a problem with ones programming/learning ability or the amount of time which one can invest. As mentioned in the first post solving the problem was very easy but one needs to understand the question first to solve it. Students like us did not get stuck in how to solve the problem but what are we expected to do or the entire work flow of the entire assignment ! Solving the problem was pretty easy  :) most of them are just a one line code.I once again repeat  the problem is not with the lectures the problem is the instructions to do the assignment is not as well designed as the rest of the course.Anyway there will always be people with a difference of opinion., Unresolved,8
Wednesday August 28th 2013 2:31 am -04:00,As I mentioned it is not about any one problem it is an over all impression of being not very clear as to what do we need to do. It took one tenth the time to solve the assignment than what it took to understand how do we proceed with the whole assignment. Any way the assignment is over and so the story ends. It was just to tell people so that it could be done a little better next time. If not no problem we can anyway figure our way out !, Unresolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 1:55 am -04:00,If anyone complaining about the clarity of the instructions ever goes on and becomes a programmer/developer you will WISH you had such clear instructions.  Instead of a written procedure you will have a number of people (say in a bank business library laboratory) who want to automate their processes and you will have to interview them for hours and hours and write your own requirements documentation.   Then you will have them look through it and everyone will want to make changes and some will conflict with each other.  Finally you will put the program/system together based upon the agreed upon requirements and spend the rest of your career fixing the things they forgot to tell you or werent able to explain logically.Yep - been there and done that.Nick , Unresolved,5

Wednesday August 28th 2013 3:05 pm -04:00,I made the functions independent from each other but maybe there are other ways too.Begin with get_seconds its the easiest one in my opinion, Unresolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 3:14 pm -04:00,I think starting with get_seconds isnt what the Profs hoped for. Given that theyve already mentioned about only doing things once & reusing functions I would implement hours then minutes then seconds in that order because you can re-use get_hours in get_minutes & you can re-use get_minutes in get_seconds. Stephen the functions should work independantly but if you turn what you were doing on its head they can make use of each other so get_minutes uses get_hours & then subtracts the number of seconds for those hours from the value given & calculates the minutes from whats left over. Does that make sense?, Unresolved,2
Thursday August 29th 2013 12:21 am -04:00,The first time i read the instructions i felt we have to evaluate the hours minutes and seconds through the three functions in such a way that finally we get the result in the HH : MM : SS format but going through the problem a few more times felt it was not needed. May be this kind of problem is what some guys here have pointed out. It might be totally a students problem of not being able to understand the question but as there are people here coming from different parts of the world and with diverse educational and experiential  background i feel making the instructions for doing the assignment a little more clear would be a good thing to do. I am not saying that the problem should be made easy it is already simple enough., Unresolved,0

That would have given a more accurate picture. Though i know it can never be 100% true as many people do not enter their correct location.

But Im not sure how to get around this problem or simplify it further. Here it is:The time_to_utcs second parameter (float) is a time in that time zone specified by the first parameter. Does this instruct the user of the function to already convert their time into float. That is if the time is 1:30 PM in their time zone must the user enter that as 13.5 or should the function incorporate this? Thanks for the help, Unresolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 2:38 pm -04:00,in step 5 in the grid describing the function requirements there is a problem with semantics.  It looks like someone used copy & paste then modify but did not change the point of reference for minutes and seconds.  For minutes the reference point should be the hour (ie top of the hour) not midnight and for seconds the reference point should be the minute not midnight.If midnight is the reference point for the minutes and seconds calculations then the values will not fit within the stated ranges.Most people will probably figure out the intended meaning by using the visual of a digital clock ., Unresolved,0

When the print statement executes (line 5) the result is: The square of num is 16 That phrase is assigned memory address id5 and points to None.

Sunday September 1st 2013 9:27 am -04:00,______________________________________I think we all need to bear in mind that this is a beginners course and we wouldnt be asked to do anything in the assignment that we havent covered in the lecture material.  ______________________________________The instructors on this course arent out to trick you.______________________________________I was pondering these thoughts after I had read the PRECONDITIONS statement of the assignment:When you see a precondition that means we are guaranteeing that we will only call that function with values that meet the precondition.And had also read the following PRECONDITION to function to_24_hour_clock():Precondition: hours >= 0And then got to the function time_from_utc() which is supposed to call function to_24_hour_clock() and found that two of the examples provided in the docstring violated the precondition rule for function to_24_hour_clock() (i.e. time_from_utc(-7 6.0) and time_from_utc(-1 0.0)!At the time I thought Hmmm ... so much for GUARENTEEING that we will only call that function with values that meet the precondition....Thinking that violating this precondition would cause the function call to fail I felt compelled to research how to perform an IF statement in Python to remedy the situation.  I thought this was unfair for a first assignment since that topic HAD NOT been covered in any of our video lectures as of yet.  It was only later after experimenting a bit that I discovered it really didnt matter  The function call to to_24_hour_clock() would work just fine with HOURS < 0!Now if we were the first people to have taken this assignment I could say Oh well it must have been an oversight on someones part and move on.  However since this is obviously NOT the first time this course has been offered Im sure Im not the first person to have made this discovery and pointed it out.  Which means that this anomaly should have been corrected at this point in time to avoid what could be significant confusion for first-time programmers.Yet this hasnt been done.______________________________________I think we all need to bear in mind that this is a beginners course and we wouldnt be asked to do anything in the assignment that we havent covered in the lecture material.  ______________________________________The instructors on this course arent out to trick you.______________________________________If these statements are to be considered TRUE then this begs the question: Why have the instructions and/or function outlines NOT been changed to CORRECT this anomaly?I mean if were being taught that part of the programming process beyond simply writing and testing code is to tweak things for correct execution then shouldnt this same strategy apply to designing a course at a university?  I would think this is a reasonable assumption., Pinned Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 3:16 pm -04:00,Then I must be missing something somewhere along the line because I dont agree with you.  However my code received 41 out of 41 points so Im not going to pursue this any further.  Hopefully on Monday well have a correctly completed code section to examine and review so I can become enlightened since we cant share sections of code on this assignment here for obvious reasons...., Pinned Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 2:50 am -04:00,Hi Jim I am struggling with def time_to_utc(utc_offset time) I am researching about the UTC offset time I thought it was a simple arithmetic addition but it seems that it is more than that since I think that we have to convert the time from military time to standard time I am trying to do that I am still having problems with getting the results below.     >>> time_to_utc(-11 18.0)    5.0    >>> time_to_utc(-1 0.0)    1.0    >>> time_to_utc(-1 23.0)    0.0I thought also in using a conditional statement but since this is the first assignment the code should be simple.  Any hints?ThanksMarion, Pinned Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 3:42 am -04:00,I am pretty sure that this map has been posted in several threads and possibly in the assignment itself but study it use the UTC examples given in a1.py and consider the time in your own time zone vs UTC(0).  The math is straightforward and the code is straightforward.For example in about 20 minutes it will be (if it wasnt Daylight Savoings Time) Midnight here or 0.0  I am in timezone UTC-8; what time will it be UTC?  Figuring this out should give you the math.http://www.worldtimezone.com/index24.phpNick, Pinned Resolved,2

I have watched every lecture carefully most of them several times yet when I read the assignment in this course I kept wanting to find an assignment. When I failed to find one I told myself to be patient it must be in a1.py. I downloaded and copied a1.py. I have now combed this over time and again ever so carefully.

Friday August 30th 2013 10:52 pm -04:00,OK you young whippersnapper anonymous... I guess I misunderstood.One function in a1.py called to_24_hour_clock is complete.  Scroll down to it and see what it is doing.  The difference between it and the incomplete function definitions give a good hint about what is required to complete them.Scroll down to it and copy from the line starting def to the line starting return;paste that into the Python Visualizer.Next copy one of the test cases (I started with to_24_hour_clock(28.5)and in the Visualizer click Enter key a couple of times and paste the test case (left justified is probably best).Then click Visualize Execution and follow alongThe line return hours % 24 asks this What is left over (remainder) from 28.5 if I divide it by 24?  This answer is 4.5 and that is what is returned.Try cutting and pasting some other of the Test cases or simply replacing the (28) with numbers of your own and running Visualize again.Most of the other function definitions (i.e.. first 3 and last several) are simply requiring you to write a similar return statement that is defined by the description line in the Code Recipe.  Only when you get to the get_seconds and following two functions do you have to also write the Code Recipes.Hope this is helpful.     , Pinned Resolved,7

Thursday August 29th 2013 4:17 pm -04:00,yes Larry I agree; the statements are not consistent.in step 5 in the grid describing the function requirements there is a problem with semantics.  It looks like someone used copy & paste then modify but did not change the point of reference for minutes and seconds.  For minutes the reference point should be the hour (ie top of the hour) not midnight and for seconds the reference point should be the minute not midnight.If midnight is the reference point for the minutes and seconds calculations then the values will not fit within the stated ranges.Most people will probably figure out the intended meaning by using the visual of a digital clock ., Unresolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 9:43 am -04:00,Larry I dont think they get it that you understand perfectly what is going on and that the problem is that the meaning conveyed by the words of the requirements is not the meaning that is intended.  For example if it is 3:12:15 AM ( ie the inbound argument is 11535) the intention of those functions is to return 3 for the hours 12 for the minutes and 15 for the seconds.  HOWEVER if one reads the requirements the hours since midnight is 3 the minutes since midnight is 192 and the seconds since midnight is 11535.  The problem is that people are failing to read the requirement closely to rigidly interpret that and to then understand your position.  Rather it seems that they skip to the intended meaning and then respond as if you have the problem.  Representational faithfulness is a very important concept in communication especially when embodied in a reference artifact.As you stated earlier the point still stands., Unresolved,-1

Thursday August 29th 2013 12:50 am -04:00,The big picture is that it is helpful to know what you are going to do before you start programming and they suggest the steps to take in creating functions something that should be a major part of Python programming.The first thing you should ask is what do I want this routine to do and that results in examples (Step 1);Step 2 is to decide the input parameter type and output type (Type Contract);after those 2 steps you should be clear enough in your mind about what you need that you can create the definition (def) AKA header (Step 3);Step 4 is the definition that tells you and subsequent programmers what will be returned by the function and what the inputs are (Description);In Steps 5 and 6 you finally write the code (Body) and Test it with some sample data.  These steps should be a breeze if you have followed the other steps logically.Hope this is what you wanted.Nick, Unresolved,2

Thursday August 29th 2013 2:08 am -04:00,Where did you read that?  Here is what the Python 3 docs says:Return the floating point value number rounded to ndigits digits after the decimal point. Ifndigits is omitted it defaults to zero. Delegates to number.__round__(ndigits).For the built-in types supporting round() values are rounded to the closest multiple of 10 to the power minus ndigits; if two multiples are equally close rounding is done toward the even choice (so for example both round(0.5) and round(-0.5) are 0 and round(1.5) is 2). The return value is an integer if called with one argument otherwise of the same type as number.Nick, Resolved,0

Thursday August 29th 2013 7:42 pm -04:00,HelloIndentation defines statement hierarchy in Python. In other languages there may be start/end tags or brackets.For example in BASIC :IF condition THEN...END IFFUNCTION function_name()...END FUNCTIONOr in Javascript :if(condition)	{	...	}function function_name()	{	...	}In Python it is indentation that determines where a statement belongs. In your first example print(Hello) belongs to function sum(). So the Python interpreter reads your function definition then reaches the result = sum(13) assignment calls function sum() to evaluate its return value calculate the value of number1 + number2 then encounters the keyword return in the function (and ignores any other statements after that line including you print statement) and proceed to assign the calculated value to variable result.In your second example print() does not belong to function sum().

Friday August 30th 2013 10:18 am -04:00,A time normally consists of 3 parts the hours the minutes & the seconds.With these 3 functions get_hours get_minutes & get_seconds we should be able to execute each of them with the same number of seconds as an argument & get back the time so for example if I called all three with the same parameter 3691 then get_hours would return 1 (there are 3600 seconds in an hour) get_minutes would return 1 (when we take off the 3600 seconds for the hour were left ith 91 and 1 minute is 60 seconds) when we call get_seconds we get back 31 because thats what is left over after weve taken off the hour & the minute. Put the 3 results together & 3691 seconds = 01:01:31.I think they separated it into 3 functions to give us practice and also to reinforce the concept of re-using functions. , Resolved,2

Friday August 30th 2013 1:16 pm -04:00,Tim regarding your modulus question you have to think of it like a clock face lets think of a clock face with 24 hours.1 % 24 = 1 because if we assume 24 is at the top of the clock (like 12 on a normal clock) we have to move 1 clockwise to get to it.In a similar way for -1 % 24 we have to go all the way round the clock to get to 23 which is the same as -1. We always go clockwise. For the integer arithmetic you can think of it as always rounding down to the nearest integer hence -1 / 24 should equal -(1/24) but a we are doing integer arithmetic we round down to the next integer which is -1. Similarly 1/24 should equal 1/24 but as we are doing integer arithmetic we round down to the net integer which is zero.Does that help?, Resolved,2

Monday September 2nd 2013 7:49 am -04:00,Its the nature of modulo arithmetic. Lets take a simple example using a normal clock face so were working modulo 12 if the hour hand is pointing to the top this can be thought of as 0 hours if we go back one hour we say its 11 oclock. In a similar way when we are doing modulo arithmetic we always go clockwise to get to our value. So with you 24 hour example -1 % 24 = 23 because in effect we go back 24 and then go clockwise to -1 which is a difference of 23. , Unresolved,0

So that we would have all we need to practice assembling the proper code with different variations/applications.  instead we are having to look back at examples in the lecture hoping we arent missing anything while attempting to get the subtle clues as to how we are going to use the 40 dif time zones along with 12noon as the zero point etc.  If we could practice more of how to do this correctly in the first few assignments we would pick up on how to think in the mindset of programming with python. Maybe more of us would be less discouraged moving forward and most importantly be encouraged to keep moving forward.  It has been discouraging  pushing on =).

If you took it and only correctly answered 10% of the questions you would get the extra 2.5% you need for a certificate.To pass (get 70%) without taking the Finalyou would have to have an average of ~93.5% on all your other work.Nick     , Resolved,6

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:13 am -04:00,Maksim I had the same failure notice and thought exactly as you did that the parameter given would be the number of seconds since the *last* midnight therefore no parameter would be input that exceeds the number of seconds in 24 hours (and therefore no need to call to_24_hour_clock). Clearly this is not the case! Apparently the parameter can be any number of seconds since (any arbitrary) midnight. I do think the wording of the instructions in this case has been quite confusing. Perhaps a rewording of the statement would prevent so many people tripping up on this problem in future iterations of this course., Resolved,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 9:28 am -04:00,Hello the actual problem is with the logic that you have coded. Please once again check the description. Because the logic (seconds % 3600) // 60 for the number of minutes i wrong because use are using % which will provide you with the remainder rather than the quotient and // operator is used for the integer part of the quotient obtained after division. So take as an example of 60 seconds which must return a value 1 use the idle to check the correctness of the expression and then put it into the idle code. Hint: seconds should be divided(60 seconds make a minute) to obtained an integer value and further it must be within the range of 0 to 59.Hope you will correct your code., Resolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 1:17 am -04:00,Something I believe strongly is that you have to have a goal in mind.  If you are just doing it because it sounds cool that might not provide the requisite drive.  Example:  I was sent to several intro programming classes at various jobs because the companies felt it was important; but it didnt have direct application to what I was doing so I learned but didnt continue.Then I went into a job where I started thinking Damn!  It would be great if we had some kind of database to manage all these materials and people and processes.  It wasnt my job but I started learning on my own and designed a series of interacting databases that saved the company 100s of thousands of dollars a year.  But a lot of my preparatory learning was by starting small:  I had a large music collection so I sat down at home and worked out how I would manage it first.  The lessons I learned there helped give me skills I used in developing the work system.So if you have a hobby or sport or whatever that might lend itself to programmatic manipulation of data sit down and write out what you would have to do to implement it.Nick    , Resolved,1

Monday September 2nd 2013 6:14 pm -04:00,Alan I am not sure of this and I dont think the staff have been very good about explaining it on any of the threads I have seen.1) from original posting until sometime yesterday (Sunday) a perfect score was 41 out of 41.  41/41 meant out of 41 possible points you received 41 i.e. 100%.2) Yesterday they added a 42nd test for large second values input to get_hours.  My score changed to 42/41 which means of 42 possible points I received 41.  They stated we werent being penalized; in other words it is still 100%.3) BUT a 42/41 means that your code did NOT handle the large numbers of seconds correctly in (most likely) the get_hours function.4) For kicks I decided I would go in and see if I could figure out my error.  I did and submitted receiving a score of 42/42; i.e. I had corrected the problem of not using to_24_hour _clock in get_hours with large values for seconds.  It is still only a 100% score but now my detailed assessment output doesnt show an error and I learned a bit.If you have 42/41 it means that of the now 42 (instead of 41) tests your code failed at least one.  I really wish the staff would be forthcoming on this.Nick, Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 7:30 pm -04:00,Certainly - this is on the results screen not the initial assignment screen that still shows 42/41.  The results screen is what I normally go to since it allows one to see details.I guess I have to ask why there isnt consistent logic between the inital screen and results screen.Perhaps we are talking at cross purposes.  I assumed that people relied on the detailed results not just the initial screen that shows:42 / 41  Show Summary Mid-Summaries Failed AllGroupAllPassFailErrorWarningViewstudent4242000DetailTotal4242000, Resolved,0

Monday September 9th 2013 5:26 pm -04:00,Im amazed as well Alain.  I would never hire anyone who waited until the exact last minute of a deadline to submit their work.  Why would anyone do this?Coursera supposedly (verified by profs from several classes I have taken) have a liberal cushion on the deadlines; I take this to mean 10-20 minutes past the deadline.  Perhaps they are a little more stringent with classes that have a regular deadline and a hard deadline.No sympathy from here especially for people who dont know different places have different time zones.  Besides from what I can tell ALL assignments for this class are due11:59am EDT.  If you are in Seattle it says on your page due 8:59 am PDT; in Chicago 10:59 am PDT; in Paris (I would guess) 5:59 pm.What I find especially rich is the complaint to NOT use 11:59 am and move it forward a minute.  Coursera JUST changed this a couple of months ago.  They used to use 12 midnight (12 am) or 12 noon (12 pm).  Students demanded that they change because that was just too confusing for them since college age and older people dont seem to have learned that 1 minute after 11.59 pm it becomes 12 am and 1 minute after 11:59 am it becomes 12 pm.  Cant win I guess.Nick   , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 4:11 pm -04:00,Right if you submit any time after the hard deadline (8:59a) you will not receive credit-- that means anytime after 8:59:00 ---which is what it seems would have been better to list as the deadline (the :00 should dispel confusion-- or at least define the deadline more clearly!, Resolved,1

Monday September 2nd 2013 6:47 pm -04:00,It states in the step 6 instructions that both time_to_utc & time_from_utc take 2 arguments a number & a float. The first of the two is the UTC offset & the second is a time. As the time is a float one can assume that 3:30PM would be supplied as 15.5 that is 15 and a half hours. 15.30 would mean 15 hours and 30/100ths of an hour which woud be 15:18 (aka 3:18PM)., Unresolved,3

Monday September 2nd 2013 5:44 pm -04:00,The actual return type of your function is NoneType because it prints the result without returning itI remember that one and I would like to say that I understand it completely ;)Till now visual effect is the same as return function gives back. I have to watch Video Lecture which explains what NonType is once more.You dont need to enclose your colon separators in parenthesisThats right. but you can add spaces after each coma to enhance readability.In my modest opinion without spaces it looks better.

But some of those algorithms I got just by trying out different calculations until the examples worked (specifically for the 2 UTC ones) and not fully understanding the math(or possibly the python) behind them. Will this be taught in future lectures possibly?I also get the feeling that part of the assignment is about learning to call functions and nesting(is this the correct term) functions because in the instructions it says several times to call the to_24_hour_clock function but so far I have found this unnecessary and/or it causes errors during the autocheck.

Monday September 2nd 2013 10:27 pm -04:00,People need to say which platform (Windows/ Mac etc.) and which version (7 OS 10 etc) they are on when describing these kind of difficulties.In Windows 7 it is as easy as pie: Left click the link for a1.py; Windows will download it to your C:\Users\whatever directory (where whatever is the name of the dirctory your downloads usually go); often your name or lastname.  If you dont know do a search of all the folders/directories in C:\Users for a1.py.   NOTE:  Windows will sometimes give a warning message that you have to respond to before downloading this kind of file.It is probably a GOOD idea to create a new directory (e.g. Python Class 2013) in the Python folder to put all your class work in.  This makes it easy for Python to find without you having to remember where it is.Next open up the Idle Python Shell and click File -> Open (Ctrl+O) and tell the file open screen that appears where to look for a1.py.  Click it and it will show up in the IDLE Editor where you can start working.Nick, Unresolved,1

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:20 am -04:00,Etienne I think the wording of the instructions that The parameter is a number of seconds since midnight may have confused some of us. I (and I believe some others) interpreted this statement to mean The parameter is the number of seconds since the *last* midnight (therefore no parameter can be input that exceeds the number of seconds in 24 hours). But apparently it means The parameter is any number of seconds that have passed since a given midnight (so no limit on the number of seconds that can be input). Perhaps a rewording of this statement would make the meaning clearer in the future., Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 5:46 am -04:00,Im not a native english speaker so maybe Im missing something in this question. But I would like to ask why The student passes at leat one of the courses is the only correct answer?Because as I think on this question the english description will depend on to what the expression (math_grade >= 50 or bio_grade >= 50 or cs_grade >= 50) evaluates to. If it evaluates to True the answer The student passes at leat one of the courses is correct but if it evaluates to False the answer The student passed none of the coureses will be correct.However if math_grade >= 50 or bio_grade >= 50 or cs_grade >= 50 are not logic expression but assignment statement stating that variables refer to some value greater than 50 it should be pointed out in the question but than the answer Student passed all of the courses should be right., Unresolved,1

Sunday September 8th 2013 12:50 pm -04:00,thank you for this explanation.  With an or statement only one true is needed so I was confused why the other choices were not also true since each contained at least one true statement except where all classes failed.  However you just explained that only one true statement is needed to have the expression evaluate to true.  So evaluation of the additional statements would not be necessary.  The way the question reads is incorrect.  Hopefully the instructors will change this. thank you again.  thank you again., Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 9:10 am -04:00,Hi !Unfortunatelly is not possible make some general thread. Just for info Im now finishing Week 2 (with delay I know..;) of Learn to Program: The Fundamentals.1 English Subtitles/Captions.Im always watching video lectures with english subtitbles turned on. Unfortunatelly they are not correct. Sometimes it cant recognize whole word and sometimes word is wrong written. Is possible to make subtitles by manual translation ?In the last video of week2 video lectures the subtitles are late behind speech of lector. I have this experience in all videos. But in this one it  is specially bad because lector is talking in long sentences. My native language is not english so I need to read the subtitbles at the right time for clear comprehension. May I somehow modify timing of subtitles ? Or structure of them?  Because one line of subtitle is not one sentence. It is like end of previous sentence + begining of new one. It is irritating.   In about time of 02:00 the subtittles goes completelly wrong.  Something bad is with it. Lectors words are not corresponding with subtitles. Words are different. Pls check it for sure in detail. 2 Run module.Is possible to run file (module) without resetting whole enviroment ? Lets assume we have some variables defined already. Now we run module and lose them. I dont want save them into other file because I need them defined just temporary for today lets say. Also is possible to load/run more than one module at same time ?3 New terms explanation. I have noticed some new terms which were not explained before they were used in video lectures. I think it were statement parameter. However it was possible to figure out what the meaning is but I would really appreciate some added explanation material about: What exacly means terms;  In which case we can/cant use them; What is difference between them by comparison.In other learning materials may other authors call same thing by different names. I would really appreciate if we may clarify all terms. To see the point of use.- argument expresssion operator operand statement procedure function function call (noun) call a function (verb) parameter    For example maybe we can use these words for same thing in some case (argument = expression = function call = parameter). It can lead into misunderstanding.4 Additional training.An experienced programmers say that: You cant become a programmer by studying books. You have to code own things and read code of other programmers.Therefore can someone recommend me a page with good habit beginner python codes to read and figure out what it does trying to improve it find a solutions for problems ?5 Visualizer.How may run in Visualizer the same thing as lector is in video lecture ?  Plus all other codes we have done or exercises too.Many thanks., Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:18 pm -04:00,Because it does whats in the innermost brackets first which means it tries to add bro and sis but at that point bro & sis are two strings. To get the correct result you need to convert both bro & sis to ints BEFORE you add them together. Say bro = 3 & sis= 2 the code above would first concatenate bro & sis as the + operator denotes concatenation for strings thus resulting in the string 32 this would then be converted into an integer with the value of 32 by the int command and then back into a string by the str. So it would print 32 siblings which is a long way from the correct answer of 5., Resolved,3

Wednesday September 4th 2013 11:19 pm -04:00,From what I have understood in other Coursera classes Coursera itself is in charge of these cut-off times.  They give maybe a half an hour leeway so if it is due at midnight you wont miss out if you post at 12:15 am their time.  But I have never seen any indication from Coursera or teaching staff that the actual due date would be waived by a day or two after it had passed.  If it were waived for a student who didnt join until 2 weeks after the course started it would be unfair if they didnt waive the due dates for students who joined 6 weeks after the course started.  It would be a logistical nightmare.So the short answer is No you are out of luck.,None,2
Thursday September 5th 2013 3:35 pm -04:00,Hi I joined this course late and when I received email about extension for Assignment 1 submission time I also misunderstood it and thought that the submission for Exercise 1 has been extended. I got late by 3 hours. This was the first due exercise and I thought I was supposed to submit it by Noon of September 2. It was actually at 8:59 am. I scored 15/15. I am wondering can anything be done about it?So many people have issues with Exercise 1. All of us would appreciate if some extension could be granted only in this exercise please.Is there a way to reach the TAs or instructors about this issue? Please advise!Hoping for an early favorable response!,None,0
Friday September 6th 2013 5:07 am -04:00,Peter - you have posted this several times.  Everything that you turn in to Coursera is held on their computers not yours.  There is absolutely no way that a program running on your computer can affect your Coursera records.  I think that a staff TA has already explained this to you.Edit:  Are you using the same login to this class that you registered with?  If so click on Exercises to the left of this screen (and Assignments if you have done it) and your scores will be there.  If they arent the probable explanation is that you have changed your logon identity from when you turned in the exercises.Nick,None,3
Sunday September 8th 2013 7:47 am -04:00,Exercise 1 is only 5% of your grade and you only need a 70% to get a certificate.  So get everything else in on time and do well and you should be in good shape.,None,2
Sunday September 8th 2013 10:31 am -04:00,Please dont start asking or considering moving the deadlines.If that is done now why not the next time? We are thousands of students and for each assignment there will be people who will be late with very solid reasons. Should the deadlines be moved everytime? whats the point of deadline at all then?This is not an official university course you lose (maybe) 5% on an online grade that counts less than zero outside of coursera lets focusing on learning instead of asking the staff to try and review all their schedule because the 0.01% of students had some misunderstanding of the deadline,None,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 11:10 am -04:00,Because you cannot be supportive of everyone because as I said every time there will be someone who will not be able to finish by the deadline. On thousands students this is only statistically bound to happen.If you dont want anyone to miss the deadline then the only option is a course without deadline selfpaced the way Udacity is.But coursera is not Udacity and most of the courses are not self-paced so the staff will never be able to accomodate all the students that could have problems.In this light the only fair solution to everyone is to never change the deadlines especially not after they expired.,None,0

This class is a good review of the argot used by computer programmers and is a somewhat different approach to getting involved in a new language.

Wednesday September 11th 2013 1:56 am -04:00,I am a novice too so your error message just looks like gibberish to me but I did spot the errors you made. I would probably start by ignoring everything in quotes since none of that is read by the computer. So what you have is thisdef seconds_difference(time_1 time_2):    return seconds_difference(time_1 - time_2) If you compare this to what a correct function definition should look like you should be able to see what happened too., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 2:04 am -04:00,Tameeka you can do this but you need to understand what the question is asking. The question is asking what is the difference between two times. Look at the example:>>> seconds_difference(1800.0 3600.0)    1800.0What is the math behind two numbers 1800 3600 that produces 1800? Understanding this will give you the math equation to solve this problem.The second problem is in your return function. Review the examples of the function design recipe.  What is the difference between your return function and this example from the lecture?def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit):    return  (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9 Hope this helps.In general one thing that has helped me is to work along with the videos in python doing the same code that the instructors. Then after I try to recreate the examples after the video lectures. It is the only way I can know if I understand the material.Also dont get discouraged. What is difficult today will seem easy in 6 months. (Im sure you cant remember when a time when you thought the alphabet was complicated but it once frustrated you too!)  There are two other free resources you might want to try for learning python/programming: udacity.com has an introduction to computer science class that takes really baby steps with a quiz after every 3 minutes of video.  Also codecademy.com has python. Good luckLori, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:07 pm -04:00,Hi TamaraIts hard to tell where your frustration is coming from but let me offer some pointers for get_hours. Since the parameter is in seconds and there are 3600 seconds in 1 hour we could use seconds divided by 3600 to convert them to hours. The example shows get_hours(3800) should return 1  but 3800/3600 = 1.055555... So we need to get rid of the remainder. I find the // operator very handy (3800//3600 =1 in python). However if you only do this get_hours(90000) would return 25 hours which violates the mandated range (0 to 23). So after converting the seconds to full hours you have to call  the to_24_hour_clock (provided) to convert the 25 to 1AM.  Hope this helps., Unresolved,3
Tuesday September 10th 2013 12:53 pm -04:00,Higet_hours is the only function that gives me 6 failures on the statement but produced the correct results when I test it. Can you give any pointers please? Im returning to_24_hour_clock(time_in_seconds // 3600), Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 8:33 pm -04:00,Erika - lets take a simple example outside of the assignment and see if we can figure out why your function isnt returning.Complete this function to determine average age of your parents:def parents_average_age(mom dad):     average = (mom + dad)//2     return                                    <<<+++++++++++  What do you return?How do you test in IDLE that the returned result is correct?edited for clarity...Nick, Unresolved,-1

Wednesday September 4th 2013 11:38 pm -04:00,Giles - this implies you have done get_hours and get_minutes and are returning valid results.So I suggest that you use the example of 43300 seconds which will result in out put for hours minutes and seconds.  Use a calculator to verify and then consider what you have to do to get the remaining seconds after x hours worth of seconds and y minutes worth of seconds have been extracted from 43300.Nick, Unresolved,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 12:33 am -04:00,If you understood the lecture great there is nothing hard. These two are excellent teachers and anyone can understand their lectures. However programming is not about syntax or little exercises you see on lectures. Python is simply a tool and programs are all about problems. That means if you dont understand a problem even if you are the best programmer in the world you cannot solve it. Which means -assuming you understood the lecture- you did not understand the problem.

Saturday September 7th 2013 2:45 am -04:00,I have to agree. I do not have the benefit of the optional book to gain insight and practice. I find it curious that the exercise questions I get wrong are based on questions I cannot practice or construct on my own. For example the week 2 exercise question with count_vowels & count_constants. I need to be able to drill these concepts to understand them. Practice is key not answering questions blindly.

Wednesday September 4th 2013 10:52 am -04:00,Only one answer is correct. Try testing with the number 10 and youll figure out whats wrong with one of the answers.Now lets see whats going on in the examples you provided:>>> (8 > x>= 5) == (8> x or x>= 5)TrueIf x is 5 6 or 7 the left-hand side will evaluate to True. The right hand side will also evaluate to True since at least one of the expressions evaluates to True (for example 8 > x). The expression True == True evaluates to True.>>> (8 > x>= 5) == (8> x and x>= 5)TrueAs before the left-hand side evaluates to True. The right-hand side will evaluate to True only if both of the expressions are True. 8 > x is True if x is 5 6 or 7. x >= 5 is also True if x is 5 6 or 7. We can conclude that the right hand-side evaluates to True. True == True evaluates to True.What would be different if we tried it with the number 10?, Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 10:58 am -04:00,I dont actually remember this question but looking at the above and guessing...its not that you have to use x=10 to solve it. Its that 8 > x >= 5is a statement that means x has to fall within this range.You need to find the answer(s) that also mean x HAS TO fall within this same range.If an answer is wrong then it will allow for x to take on values not in this range.

Wednesday September 4th 2013 9:29 pm -04:00,Kevin - in your other post one of the TAs suggested a SyntaxError; this sounds right so do this.Bring a1.py as submitted up in the IDLE Editor and run it as a complete program.  This will make sure all 9 functions in the program are available for testing in the shell.The Python shell will do a RESTART.Now go through from top to bottom and run one or two tests in the shell for each of the 9 functions. If a1.py runs without throwing an error and you can test each function successfully then let us know.  Dont take any shortcuts.  A raw score of 0 indicates that there is something very basic wrong with your program and it should be apparent if you follow these steps.I speak from experience. My first score was 41/41 and I was pleased.  Then several days later they added an additional test so I went in to see if I could pass it.  When I posted my solution I received a score of 1 out of 41!  I had introduced a minor error that threw the whole thing out of whack and it was easy to find  following the above procedure (took like 2 minutes).Nick, Unresolved,1
Thursday September 5th 2013 1:16 am -04:00,Kevin - if you are unable or unwilling to run the complete a1.py module in IDLE how about doing a copy and paste of the complete module into the Python Visualizer.  I just tested mine and it accepted the 200+ lines just fine and ran it perfectly.  It is not apparent from your second to the last post if you have done what Etienne has suggested on 2 threads and I suggested here.  The Visualizer should also help you catch the error.  Nick, Unresolved,0

Thursday September 5th 2013 10:32 pm -04:00,Dont mix spaces with tabs when indenting.  This can introduce this type of errors.  Unless I can use an editor that converts tabs to 4 spaces I always just hit the Space Bar 4 times even tho hitting Tab once is easier.Here is a routine I copied from the internet:import sysdef Factorial(n): # return factorial    result = 1    for i in range (1n):        result = result * i    print factorial is result    return resultprint Factorial(10)1) after a colon (:) indent 4 spaces2) continue this level of indentation until return or you have another colon3) after your return from a function you should stop your indentationEditorial comment:  I think it is a bit of a shame that Profs havent talked about comments (#) yet.We are expected to write lengthy Code Recipes that create a lot of verbiage between our function defs and code body.  I think this is often what throws peoples indentation off.  If people knew about comments they could be shown how (in an editor) they can hilite and completely comment out a block of test that Python will then completely ignore.Nick, Unresolved,0

Friday September 6th 2013 1:43 am -04:00,It is about 10:30 pm on the Pacific Coast of the US as I write this.  This is a real deadtime for Coursera forums.  It is between 11:30 pm and 2:30 am in most of the rest of North Central and South America so people are asleep. In Europe Africa most of Asia and Australia it is either very early morning or working hours.  Consequently during some of my best computer time hours few others are online.So here is the challenge for AFTER the current project due date has passed.  Using the functions we learned to write in Assignment 1 and your own timezone create a program to figure out the best and worst times for you to be asking questions on the forum.Extra credit if you use an input function so that it can be used by an individual in any time zone.Additional extra credit if you can use the zeemap of student locations as shown here:  http://goo.gl/FDanmA   Higher densities of students in areas where they might be awake and on the computer when you are would indicate you would get quicker responses to your forum queries.So now Ill post this and by the time everyone else is awake it will have dropped to the second or third page of questions.  If so I will give it a bump about 2 or 3 am (if I am up that late) or tomorrow early afternoon.Nick ,None,0
Friday September 6th 2013 2:54 am -04:00,Hi Tim - your question about what defines a good time raises some questions I hadnt really considered but yeah lets go with 6pm - midnight for now.  The main problem is that if we assume everybody is most likely to be posting between 6pm and midnight their time it leaves a very narrow window. It probably needs to be defined better but it is almost midnight here so I am not going to think about it much more tonight. I dont think we would have to limit the challenge to using what we have learned in class but it probably could be done.  I dont think I have ever taken a programming class where I havent thought of a problem that I needed to solve and just jumped into other resources when I reached the limit to my current understanding; that is how we learn.,None,0
Friday September 6th 2013 5:02 am -04:00,Here is some additional detail that might help.If we assume that the student location map is a fair representation of class enrollment by area and students who use the forums to ask/answer questions then we can say these time zones each have a substantial number of students.  I think these are reasonable assumptions and even if they arent this is just a fun exercise in logic not production software. Americas:  UTC-6 and UTC-5Europeetc:  UTC(0) UTC+1 and UTC+2Somewhat less densely populated (with students) than these are UTC+5:30 and UTC+8 and UTC+9I would approach the challenge as What time(s) is it where I live when large numbers of people in these time zones are most likely to be on their computers (definitely non-sleeping hours and probably non-working hours for them)?  The result should be times that you might have the most luck in getting several fairly quick responses to your posts.Please feel free to expand on this quasi requirements doc or point out where it might not work.Nick         ,None,0

Friday September 6th 2013 11:36 pm -04:00,Im going to post the for loop since it will be new to beginning programmers who might want to attempt this challenge.  Fairly simple examples like this should be available to reinforce what we have learned and this is an excellent one.  So here it is but if requested by 2 or 3 people I will delete it (Ill see it quickly because I always have my email program opened).starting line for FizzBuzz is:for n in range(1101): ,None,1
Saturday September 7th 2013 1:30 am -04:00,What is important is to NOT get hung up on trivia.  Like whether the items print on single lines or grouped together separated by commas.  The whole point of the exercise is to work out the logic... apparently the FizzBuzz test (and others like it) were just simple tests put together to test whether a job applicant had any aptitude for programming.  As you learn more you will find a dozen more ways to implement this in Python: no one way is more right.  For example you could create an empty list (mylist = ) and append the output to it.  Then the result would be:[1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz Fizz 22 23 Fizz Buzz 26 Fizz 28 29 FizzBuzz 31 32 Fizz 34 Buzz Fizz 37 38 Fizz Buzz 41 Fizz 43 44 FizzBuzz 46 47 Fizz 49 Buzz Fizz 52 53 Fizz Buzz 56 Fizz 58 59 FizzBuzz 61 62 Fizz 64 Buzz Fizz 67 68 Fizz Buzz 71 Fizz 73 74 FizzBuzz 76 77 Fizz 79 Buzz Fizz 82 83 Fizz Buzz 86 Fizz 88 89 FizzBuzz 91 92 Fizz 94 Buzz Fizz 97 98 Fizz Buzz]There are possibly as many ways to solve this as their are programmers.  Edit:  try this in IDLE:for i in range(1101):print(FizzBuzz[i*i%3*4:8--i**4%5]or i)Nick,None,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 4:01 am -04:00,Arnold - looks good but a few problems.  I would strongly suggest you just do the for loop first outside of trying to enclose it in a function.  Thats where I see your main problem.  Get that loop working first and then modify.  It is almost correct but you need to add for example print(n) rather than just n.  The other problem is that you are calling your variable i in the for loop and then calling it n all other places.After you get the loop right and the output correct ypou can think about what you need to do to put it in a function def.Nick,None,1

If youve already done the first assignment then tkinter is the GUi used for a1_gui.py.

Saturday September 7th 2013 10:40 pm -04:00,Good Etienne. After I noticed no one else had responded I decided to point a couple of things out as well but taking a different tack.  The first line of Step 1 says we are providing starter code that contains some function headers and docstrings and one complete function. That complete function is to_24_hour_clock. Have you copy/pasted that into visualizer and studied it to see exactly what it is doing? Run it 10 times if you have to until you understand how the process works.  Here it is with the test cases so you can just copy/paste this directly into Visualizer:def to_24_hour_clock(hours):     (number) -> number    hours is a number of hours since midnight. Return the    hour as seen on a 24-hour clock.    Precondition: hours >= 0    >>> to_24_hour_clock(24)    0    >>> to_24_hour_clock(48)    0    >>> to_24_hour_clock(25)    1    >>> to_24_hour_clock(4)    4    >>> to_24_hour_clock(28.5)    4.5        return hours % 24to_24_hour_clock(24)to_24_hour_clock(48)to_24_hour_clock(25)to_24_hour_clock(4)to_24_hour_clock(28.5) All the other functions work (logically) the same. The only difference is a modest change in the body of the code.   Nick   , Unresolved,1

Monday September 30th 2013 10:23 pm -04:00,For those who are surprised that free online versions of university courses are rather simplified overviews of the in-person versions:  this is a pretty well-known fact.  A 5 credit class at a university (on the quarter system) normally requires 3-4 hours of in-class lecture per week for 10 weeks and often has a 1 hour lab that may or may not have required attendance.  The profs for Rice U. Python class estimate they cover about 25-40% on Coursera as they cover in the same class on campus.In addition I doubt that the MIT 6 class will be anywhere near as challenging as the in class experience since it is being done in 8 weeks versus a semester for on-campus version (full lectures available on MITs site; total of about 24 hours). Nick , Resolved,1
Saturday September 21st 2013 7:28 pm -04:00,This may alleviate some anxiety about the final if you are worried about getting a certificate You can take the quizzes up to 5 times and that you can keep resubmitting the code for the assignments as many times as you need to get it right (before the hard deadline of course). Take advantage of this fact to max out the number of points you get on each quiz and programming assignment. Then you will have less to worry about when you take the final exam. Indeed if you do the math you can find that if you get really high scores on the quizzes and programming assignments (together worth 75% of the total points for the class) then you can get a low score on the final and still get a certificate. Of course I dont advise getting a low score on the final and since I really want to learn this stuff I will be studying and reviewing to the best of  my ability for the final even though I have an average of about 98% so far (yes I was too lazy to keep resubmitting the quizzes until I got 100%)., Resolved,2

Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:42 am -04:00,Maybe this will help time_from_utc & time_to_utc are complementary take these examples from the docstrings:def time_to_utc(utc_offset time):     (number float) -> float    Return time at UTC+0 where utc_offset is the number of hours away from    UTC+0.    >>> time_to_utc(+1 12.0)    11.0    def time_from_utc(utc_offset time):     (number float) -> float    Return UTC time in time zone utc_offset.    >>> time_from_utc(-1 12.0)    11.0    So in time_to_utc we have the arguments +1 & 12.0 and the result is 11.0. Then in time_from_utc we have the arguments -1 & 12.0 and the result is 11.0.So we get the same result from both functions the time supplied as an argument is the same the only thing thats changed is the sign of the utc_offset.What does that tell us about the 2 functions?, Unresolved,0

Does shift + enter work in the Python shell to go to the next line of code without  executing the current line? How am I even suppose to write yesno into python when I cant get to the next line? Is this only because I cant have a line break within a string? 2. What is really the point of this question? I think I understand that using  in yesno gets interpreted as just  and not a line break because it is in a string which is just read as letters. I also understand that writing a string using / around it needs to be done in one line. Am I missing something because that seems too trivial of a point to be tested on? , Resolved,0

Sunday September 8th 2013 8:04 pm -04:00,Yes - I think you are talking about the old concept of Programmed Instruction which is making a bit of a comeback.  Look up the term on the Internet.  Here is a recent scholarly paper on it that says in the abstract ...has been demonstrated to be effective and economical in the teaching of complex mathematics and biology concepts.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3120083/You might be interested in looking at the Khan Academy (free online).  One math series:https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/linear-equations-and-inequalitie/coordinate-plane/v/plot-ordered-pairsIt isnt so much using programming as a path to math... dont quite know how that would work.  There are specially built computing tools for mathematicians to use in their work for instance TeX.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX#Mathematical_example Nick  ,None,2

Saturday September 28th 2013 11:30 am -04:00,I have no idea what the final exam for this course will be but I have had final exams on Coursera before.  I can say what Im expecting and preparing for if thats any help to anybody whos doing their first Coursera course.Personally I expect our instructors are fair-minded and sensible people and that the exam will be fair and will cover the course material. If our instructors expect a lot of memorization then theyll let us know. Some questions might be tricky but I dont expect any big surprises; the material should all seem familiar. Theyll probably test our knowledge of Python and our understanding of the  programming principles covered in the course. On the Coursera courses Ive taken so far all final exams have been open-book. Usually final exams are similar to the homework quiz exercises (more like our multiple choice quizzes than our programming assignments).  Typically theres something like two or three minutes per multiple-choice question e.g. I recently had a timed two-hour final exam with fifty multiple choice questions which took me only an hour to complete (I did fine). As long as you review the course materials in advance two or three minutes per question is lots of time; theres time to look things up try a code snippet in Python and re-check your answers before submitting. Its possible they could give us programming questions like in our programming assignments but I dont worry about that myself.  Our instructors know very well that programming questions take more time itd be ok.  The main thing is to prepare by reviewing the course materials.  For me I try to understand what theyre trying to tell me in each module. Its amazing how much easier it can be the second time through. This course isnt only about Python; the basic underlying principles of programming are equally (if not more) important.  Sometimes I prepare my own course cheat sheet; for this course Ill probably start with those nice summary notes theyve given us for each video as they outline whats important. Ill also  review of all my homework exercises and assignments and make sure I understand the answers and the explanations provided. If I have any attempts left on the homework exercises and can retry them again without penalty (i.e. if they use the highest mark before the hard deadline) then Ill do that for the practice. Actually I think Ill get started on that now!, Resolved,1
Saturday September 28th 2013 11:52 am -04:00,Disagree.  Ive been a real programmer for many years (not Python).  Sure I remember a lot about a language or a technology that I use routinely but I never had to purposefully memorize syntax or an API.  The skills and the tools and technologies that I need are so diverse that it would be impossible to memorize it all anyway.  I look things up double check things and learn something new every single day. , Resolved,6
Saturday September 28th 2013 5:04 pm -04:00,Whether FORTRAN or COBOL is used anymore isnt the point.  Of course theyre both still in use.  I think the point is whether professionals memorize a language or not?I think they get proficient in the basic language and common libraries and they look up the rest when they need it.  Memorizing all the details of a language and its extended libraries is impossible even for people who use a language or platform frequently. And would be useless anyway. These languages change from time to time new versions are released. , Resolved,0

Sunday September 29th 2013 12:51 pm -04:00,Chrissie you are right but its a perspective that comes with long experience.  Im a Java programmer too and I had to laugh when you said two years experience does not make you a real programmer whatever the hell that is.   That is so true. I couldnt define whats a real programmer either. The most important trait is were survivors!Shahab you are at the beginning and youll do well to listen to those who are more experienced and be grateful if they take time to offer their perspective. At my workplace entry-level junior programming jobs require a university degree and a minimum of two years experience. But interpersonal skills are just as important as technical skills.  Communication which includes listening is among the most important.  I think youll probably change your mind as you become more experienced.  Good luck to you.If any new programmers are worried about the exam its to realize that were all in that same boat in some way.  What were saying here is that working programmers dont bother memorizing. We have to be ready to adapt to whatever is thrown our way. Of course the fundamentals become familiar with time and practice and we dont need to look that up.  But we do look up details all the time. The only time we might memorize stuff is if we want to take certification exams or were job-hunting and have a technical exam to pass. Peace!, Resolved,0

Monday September 9th 2013 2:07 pm -04:00,on this problem you subtract from results the value int(digit) on each loop.  since digit is the counter for the loop that implies subtracting the values 1-10 inclusive.  however the choices for answers include 55 (and not 45) meaning that the code should have you subtract the values int(digits) which would be the values 0-9 inclusive.  therefore there appears to be a typo.  if i am wrong can someone please clarify why int(digit) does not refer to a counter?  does the counter take on the values of each character in the string when converted to digits or is it still a counter but the counter starts at 0 like indices of a string say rather than starting from a count of 1?, Resolved,0

If you need a picture I can compose one.On the assignments the detail is in the error hyperlinks when you get the details.  One of the TAs Etienne has written a faq on how to drill down to that level of detail.  What you will need to do is figure out the meaning of the unit test test scripts output.  Its usually of the form of test name (which can be weird but is a clue to which part is wrong and possibly why and theres usually an evaluation of the test assertion compared to the value generated by your function for the test).

One way to find if a (number) is prime is to divide it by all the numbers from 2 to (number-1) and see if all the results are integers.Of course even the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes could see that this was a waste of time and found a way (sieve) to do it quicker.The challenge was reignited in the 20th century when really big primes are used in Public Key Cryptography to make communications more secure. So now other sieves exist maybe better than EratosthenesSo lets code some sieve functions for checking big integers to find which sieve is the quicker.Happy coding!PS: wikipedia is your friend.,None,3

Wednesday September 18th 2013 1:06 pm -04:00,Your close but in general you work from the inner most brackets outward so the first thing we do is turn char into an int for example 2 becomes 2.1. int(char) means 2 becomes 2 and 9 becomes 9.1 (int(char) + 1)  means the 2 goes to a 3 and make the 9 go to 102 ((int(char) + 1) %10) means the mod (%) of 3 is 3 and the mod(%) of 10 is 0 = 303.str((int(char) + 1) %10) means to turn 3 into 3 and 0 into 0This is done char by char so first we go thru the whole process for the 2 and next time round the loop we do the whole thing with the 9, Resolved,1

Sunday September 22nd 2013 9:48 pm -04:00,Hopefully Ive made it easier for you to imagine a reason why in a computer program an empty string might be a valid value for something like a DNA sequence as a simple expedient.I cant agree at all. You can also say that in a computer program an empty string can be a valid value for anything you want it to be which is true but thats not what we are discussing about.This course is to teach us programming and preferably good programming habit (critical/logical thinking) and I think an assignment that encourages people to even attempt to argue that no DNA sequence is even remotely possibly a valid DNA sequence is quite retarded. Our goal was to figure out if an existing string is a valid DNA sequence not to argue philosophically if nothing == a thing. If I wanted to argue about existentialism I would take philsophy101 not LTP101.Your college class example would be better for something that requires an int result instead of a bool result. For a class with 0 student that expects a bool result such as the def we did in our homework it should probably still come out as False., Resolved,-1
Sunday September 22nd 2013 11:16 pm -04:00,What is the point of using something that refers to a real life scenario (a person who would like to find out if a bunch of letters is a valid DNA string) if I were told to ignore this part and just follow the instruction and not complain? I just dont understand why people would say that its an acceptable idea for a programmer to just deal with it and to follow instruction instead of seeing dna as DNA in real life. The homework obviously was referring to real DNA... I dont know why people are promoting others to ignore what DNA is supposed to be. And I dont see how this is a good habit as a programmer to just do your work without understanding at least a bit of what you are attempting to make.If the homework was made out of something that is completely unrelated to real life and tell me that an empty string should return True in def magical_banana I wouldnt complain to begin with. So yes Im okay with an empty string being valid. (edit: And thanks for that info!) I just cant agree with these comments trying to rationalize why nothing is ok for a valid DNA sequence particularly in this homework. And for learning to program I think its a problem that there are people promoting others to just code based on the instructions and question nothing because they dont matter as long as your code works. So what if your code works mathematically? If it fails to comply with real life logic its useless., Resolved,-1

Monday September 23rd 2013 2:20 am -04:00,There was nothing to win or lose to begin with it was a discussion. It is useless for the homework to be changed now of course but I was mainly voicing my concern about this attitude with real life programmers. True I probably wont be able to work like a programmer in real life if a sanity check is something that is considered something hazardous. This exercise in computer programming is supposed to at least attempt to teach us something in real life programming I want to learn python because I want to make something cool or useful not something that gives you a result regardless what the meaning of the result is. But I guess not a lot of people agree with that idea. It wasnt really a big deal that the teachers created this small problem its how people responded to the problem that disturbed me... that its okay if the instruction seems to be incorrect as long as you get your job done.Call me idealistic I think coding based on instructions without an understanding of what exactly you are creating is a bad move. Its basically how shitty software is made. But sure if keeping your job is more important than making something useful then do whatever you need because money is always the most important reason. As long as you get your thing done who cares if no DNA is a DNA sequence as long as it is correct within the language right? Things are always someone elses problem.Congratulations on winning too.

Sorry about editing afterwards sometimes I dont expect quick response and usually avoid editing after I got a response but I guess I was still too slow (but of course if I edit I must be evil and want you to look really really bad!). I hit submit when Im pissed without checking and I usually find some bs or grammar mistakes afterwards. If you feel like I cheated by all means change yours too and make yourself the victim.. I dont think I actually even edited that much. I will add those bs back as I remembered if it bothered you so much. Your whole response is to address me fixing my post when I didnt even do much of that at all. So thanks for your valuable input. I wasnt trying to insult. I just said that I really feel like its a bad way to go at things. I guess it could be an insult to you if I disagree with the way you do things in a sense if youd like to look at it that way. It was really you who brought up the whole argument thing I was pissed but I was never really taking anything personally or attacking you directly. If you were my friend in real life and you said that its okay to code even though it probably is going to make the software buggy for the user as long as your boss is happy I would still tell you that you should probably stop doing that and probably try to get a better job with a better boss. And then I will thank you for hating me.To anon I am pissed off. Probably because I didnt come to Coursera to see the same people I see at school. I expected people to be here to want to learn the subject itself not to conform themselves to societys expectation or to get good grades since that usually happens when people are forced to go to school. In a class I feel like we should be taught idealistically instead of telling people you should just ignore possible knowledge and deal with it because you shouldnt question authority. Its probably the worst teaching approach I have experienced so I go against it quite harshly. And I understand why people would be insulted if they feel like its okay to do things to survive but my opinion remains unchanged. Conclusion: I disagree with people promoting the idea of ignoring the softwares usefulness to the user and simply claim that I did my job and I dont care and I think you should stop telling people to do that. , Resolved,0

Thursday September 12th 2013 6:54 am -04:00,You dont have to worry about villain and hero_dude belonging to the same class there will be no conflict -- well... not on a programmatic level at least :-)As far as I can tell a class (or a blue print or a prototype) defines routines that will be shared by all class members. When you create a new character (a new object) your programme will reserve an area of memory to store your characters data (the object properties). Furthermore the variable pointing to that area of memory will be linked to the class it belongs to such that when your programme encounters hero_dude.move_up() it knows that it should call the move_up routine within the class Character. move_up will be passed a reference pointing to the memory area where hero_dude data is stored (the self argument) so there is no way villain.move_up() and hero_dude.move_up() can cause any access conflict (if that is what you had in mind).Also have you checked this course?,None,1

Tuesday September 10th 2013 5:35 pm -04:00,Its not the easiest thing to explain without some diagrams but very breifly the stack is an area of the computers memory. Every time you call a function a new stack frame is created on the top of the stack and any variables created during the execution of that function are allocated memory in that stack frame. When you exit the function the stack frame is de-allocated.

Thursday September 12th 2013 3:18 am -04:00,Information on all these questions is pretty easy to find.  Coursera has a detailed FAQ.This should answer most of the questions in this thread:While some assignments will have only one deadline (the hard deadline) others may have a due date that comes a few days or weeks before the hard deadline.In general the due date is the date by which you should submit the assignment and the hard deadline is the date by which you must submit it if you want to receive credit. Most instructors implement a grade penalty*** for submissions between the due date and the hard deadline (for example submissions after the due date might incur a grade deduction of 20% per day so that a score of 10 submitted two days after the due date becomes a score of 6 and any score submitted on the 5th day or later becomes a score of 0). Sometimes however instructors will use the due date merely as a recommended deadline to keep students on track and will not impose a grade penalty on any submission made before the hard deadline.Check the assignment policies carefully to determine how submissions after the due date will be treated. For quizzes and homework you will be able to attempt the assignment for practice even after the hard deadline has passed; exams may not be available to attempt after the hard deadline.*** These instructors are being VERY lenient in not imposing penalties after Due Date has passed and even added 2 days to the Hard date of Assignment 1.   Most classes I have taken have been quite strict on this:  possibly a difference between Canadian and American pedagogy. (Thats a joke.) I dont know what more you could ask for.NickBTW Kevin - You are not old; I figure you are young middle age because if youre not I am decrepit.  And if you just want to learn a grade shouldnt matter., Unresolved,3

Wednesday September 11th 2013 9:25 pm -04:00,I was wondering about this case too.  I looked back at the instructions and they do say a DNA sequence is valid if it contains no characters other than A T C and G.  Since the empty string does not contain any characters that are not  A T C or G by that definition I guess it is valid., Resolved,1

Thursday September 12th 2013 7:15 am -04:00,i agree with you here kevin but if u read the instructions it says: Return True if and only if the DNA sequence is valid (that is it contains no characters other than A T C and G). this is also a good practice in logic and understanding what you read. if u read it carefully you understand that their definition of valid sequence is one that has no other characters other than TGCA. we should sometimes let go of our background knowledge and just read the instruction., Resolved,1
Thursday September 12th 2013 8:34 am -04:00,ok were in agreement here. but people get stuck on this problem and get frustrated which is unproductive and they blame the professors. for me it never even crossed my mind that the string cannot be empty. after all   is not a valid string or an invalid string. it is just nothing. anyway as far as what we have learned in this course. obviously for people with background in genetics or programming that is surprising and i understand that. , Resolved,1

Thursday September 12th 2013 8:13 am -04:00,A function can sometimes seem like a black box you call your fuction with some arguments & it gives you back a result. When developing a function it may be that when you test it it gives you a result different from what you expected.At this point the print statement becomes one of your best friends. Putting one or more print statements within your function can give an idea of what its actually doing.An example a small function to count the number of As in a string:def countas(myString):    count = 0    for char in myString:        if char == A:            count += 1        else:            return countmyTest = countas(ABCDABCD)print(myTest)One would hope that the rsult of this would be 2 but in fact you get 1.Putting a pirnt statement within the for loop like this:def countas(myString):    count = 0    for char in myString:        print loop        if char == A:            count += 1        else:            return countmyTest = countas(ABCDABCD)print(myTest)I would expect to see loop printed out each time a character is examined so there should be as many loops as there are characters in the string but what I get is:looploop1Which clues me in to the fact that Im exiting my loop early.Print statements are a great way to demistify the contents of the black box and tell you what bit of the function is causing the problem. Just dont forget to remove them or comment them out before submitting your code.OK Ill get off my soapbox now.,None,1

Thursday September 12th 2013 10:24 pm -04:00,Since there are nearly always many correct ways to solve a programming problem how would you suggest that the profs/staff should do this?  You know that as soon as they post one solution 16 people are going to post saying But I did it this way and received credit!.  I guess there is some benefit in seeing how many different ways any one problem can be solved.But wouldnt it be better now that the hard deadline for week 1 and 2 exercises and assignment 1 have passed to ask on the forums?  You can (even anonymously) ask I missed Question 14 on Quiz 2.  Will someone please post the answer and why it is correct?Im a bit surprised that this hasnt started already.Nick, Unresolved,1

Friday September 13th 2013 5:48 pm -04:00,Erin - Have you taken other Coursera classes?  I have and your reading of the honor code point 3 is a little off I would say.  I interpret it to imply that one shouldnt give others the answers to their benefit; i.e. before the assignment is due.Here is my evidence that your interpretation is wrong:  In the Interactive Python course 10 minutes after the assignment (pretty hard-core projects) were due the staff would open a Feedback thread.**  Everyone would post their code and talk about special routines that they had implemented and help people who had been having problems see what they needed to do to complete their projects (fo no credit of course).  There are plenty of other Interactive students here who can back me up on this.So absolutely NO talking about assignments after they are due is not a code violation.I have no idea why the staff hasnt clarified this.  Paul or Jen should open a discussion thread after each exercise/assignment is due.** Here is a quote showing how these feedback threads would normally start:  For those of you that missed the submission deadline or those who just who wish for more feedback feel free to post a link to Blackjack in this thread. You may post under your own name or anonymously. In your comments please be thoughtful in your suggestions.

Friday September 13th 2013 6:13 pm -04:00,OK that one has a bit more weight.  The first one was a Coursera-wide command and should apply to all classes; classes that dont abide by a Coursera injunction tend to disprove your reading of it.  The second one is from this courses Wiki:  of course they dont want solutions pasted into the Wiki which is a long-term document.  Most classes (from what I understand) delete their forum threads (or otherwise make them inaccessible) before the next run of the class.Here is what I am going to do to test this.  I am going to start a thread that talks about one of the routines in Assignment 1 in a few minutes.  I will call it here is how I did time_to_utc: did you solve differently?  And see what happens.Nick, Unresolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 5:24 pm -04:00,The biggest problem I have so far being 4 weeks into the course as someone with zero programming experience is the HUGE gulf between the examples given in the video lectures and the actual coding required to complete the exercises and assignments.  Sure I can use youtube and the internet to hunt for understanding but that sort of defeats the purpose of taking an official class. Im finding the discussion boards to be quite scattered and of moderate benefit so far but perhaps Im not using them properly.I dont have 30 hours per week to commit to this class.

Thursday September 12th 2013 3:01 pm -04:00,Its to do with the way Python internally stores floats. Try this in Visualizer & youll see what I mean:x = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1print(x)y = 0.3print(x == y)This is why you should never compare floats for equality you should always check that the difference between them is less than a delta value., Unresolved,3

Saturday September 14th 2013 7:13 am -04:00,No x is never 0.3.x = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 and when Python does that calculation a small error is introduced because of the way computers store floating point numbers. As you can see the difference is very small but is enough to make a difference. Computers are very literal machines things are only equal if they are EXACTLY equal hence x==y is false. This is why you should never compare 2 floats for equality you should always check that the difference between them is less than a small delta value thus saying that they are approximately equal.The problem arises because we work using the decimal system and computers work in binary and the computer has to convert between the two.Heres a web page that does binary/decimal/hexadecimal conversions that might help.http://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal-converter.html, Unresolved,2

Friday September 13th 2013 7:28 am -04:00,Alison the most important points here are the lines FAILURE: AssertionError the lines following those are the biggest clue as to why the tests are failing. The first one True is not false tells us that in some case where there was an invalid capital letter in the string supplied the function retruned a value of True rather than False.The second one None is not true tells us that when the function was given a zero length sequence it did not return a value when it should have returned True. This may seem a bit strange but for the purpose of this exercise an empty string is regarded as being valid.Did you watch the lecture about the Python debugger? Running your tests with that may give you a clue.For the second one try this test:print(is_valid_sequence())If your function is working correctly it should print the value True., Resolved,1

Friday September 13th 2013 1:12 pm -04:00,Yes but there is a way you can work your way thru the string one character at a time using get_complement to get the complementary sequence.Generally function re-use is to be encouraged if I had for example an interest calculation Id want to write it once & use it everywhere that I needed it not write the same code out again in several places. Programmers like to subscribe to the DRY principle Dont Repeat Yourself.If you have the same calculation written in many palces what happens if that calculation has to change? You have to find everywhere you did it & makes the same changes., Resolved,0

Saturday September 14th 2013 5:57 am -04:00,Well is does say that the input to get_complement will be a nucleotide (A T C or G) and to return the nucletides complement. So that does infer a single character.I think one of the things they were trying to get across is function re-use so we re-use our get_complement function in our get_complementary_sequence function. I know its unlikely in this case but what if a new nucleotide was discovered? Youd have to remember to make changes in 2 places if you re-used your function you would only have to change it in one place., Resolved,0

You have to keep pushing yourself and learning by doing. You should be at the point after 4 weeks of at least being able to figure out what other peoples simple programs are doing.  By the end of 7 weeks you should be able to (based on the syllabus) at least import an Excel type spreadseet and manipulate the data and output the new data into a new spreadsheet.  You should probably also be able to figure out how to write a simple text-based game like Rock Paper Scissors without much problem (neither of these is more than 20 -35 lines of pretty simple code).Writing all but the simplest notepad type editor is going to require using Python classes that you wont learn about unless you study object oriented programming which is not in this introductory class.Nick, Unresolved,1

Sunday September 15th 2013 11:41 am -04:00,Its a bit difficult to explain but Ill give it a go.Python has certain rules about what is considered True & False you can read those rules here.The first line:>>> w in wordTruew is in word so this evaluates to True as you would expect.The second one:>>> w and o in wordTrueThis is probably not doing ehat you think it does but in this case gives the result you expect. Python sees this as 2 boolean conditions to be valuated either side of an and so basically w evaluates to True AND o in word evaluates to True so the overall expression evaluates to True.The third one:>>> w or o in wordwAgain this is evaluated as 2 boolean conditions but this time separated by an or. Python first sees the w which evaluates to True and Python knows it doesnt need to evaluate the second conditon because True ord with anything else is still going to be True so Python returns the first condition hence the w.Does that help?If you wanted to check that both o and w were in word one way would be to say:w in word and o in wordBy the same rules:>>> p and o in wordTrue, Resolved,0

Try testing your code in the Visualizer & youll see what I mean.Think about this if you find an invalid character you can return False straight away because one invalid character is enough to make the whole string invalid.

I also have to pause videos many times during the lecture not because they are confusing but because they are so succinct. So my adaptation style are somewhat like followings:Keep a pencil and paper to jot down points that seem important to me (what I understand and what I do not)Pause video whenever necessary (as this is not classroom lectures)Keep IDLE open to type and test the code.Read lecture summaries and refer back to it whenever necessary.Return back to those points where I felt difficulties (based on my jotted down notes) .To me the content are carefully chosen and the examples carefully matched to the lectures.

Theres nothing to prevent anyone from watching the video to learn the basics and then going to town in Idle. Except that a lot of people would probably freeze up in fright if just asked to do computer things on their own. Theres just something about code that looks like gibberish on a page. I personally have found this course pretty easy. And Im a complete beginner. The lecturers make things easy to understand (once Ive paused and rewound enough times!) the exercises are doable and the assignments are surprisingly easy to do too because theyre so guided. I was dreading assignment 2 because I saw people saying it was harder than Assignment 1 but once I actually started on it it was amazing how much guidance they give you in the handout. I dont think that this course requires an excessive amount of logical/mathematical thinking skills or encyclopedic readings or what have you. Just basic logic and an understanding of the English language is enough to do well in it.(I do think it would be nice if the autograder could be reworked to offer feedback in more English and less gibberish.

Monday September 16th 2013 9:56 am -04:00,Invalid sequence.  And I see where you are going with this: the empty string is a subset of a valid string.  From a coding perspective I think I agree with you.From the viewpoint of that being part of the assignment I think the assignment should clarify this.  I think that because:1.  A sequence is one or more characters.  Not zero or more characters or you could never say not a sequence although you could say not a valid sequence. 2.  A valid DNA sequence contains ATCG.  If you try to use empty string as a sequence in real life its not going to get you anything.  So its not an appropriate example unless its clarified. 3.  In the lecture the point was made that the empty string would not even make it to the for loop.  So its a special case. Im doing this to learn so I dont need my grade changed.  I know a couple people saw it the way that I did.  They may or may not be happy with this.Thank you for answering. , Unresolved,0

Sunday September 22nd 2013 9:17 am -04:00,You added an extra bracket and that wasnt the right answer and it wasnt the answer they were looking for. I agree that some of these answers can be ambiguous but as you will recall from the previous exercises it is common that IDLE allows for some mistakes to be user friendly. After all it only knows what you enter. But in this case the teachers want you to do it the right way the way they taught you in the lectures. Both you and I know an extra bracket is wrong in an expression like this. Even if it comes up right in IDLE you should still know its the wrong answer from what youve learned in the lectures., Resolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 9:51 am -04:00,As far as I can tell there is nothing wrong in adding an extra pair of parentheses as she did.As a matter of fact all these expressions s2(s2)((s2))(((s2)))etc.evaluate to the value of s2.

Sunday September 22nd 2013 11:13 am -04:00,OK let me explain it like this. You know those toys that toddlers have where you have to put different shapes into holes of the same shape? Well this is just like those toys. Sometimes you could get a circle to go into a square hole or a triangle into the rectangle hole. They worked. Doesnt mean theyre right. Just like too many brackets work but that doesnt mean theyre right. If you recall from the lectures the expressions need to be a simplified as possible not because they may not work now but because when you start working with bigger problems there are more chances that the extra brackets will confuse the issue and create problems. Thats why the grader marks it wrong. Because you need to learn that., Resolved,1
Sunday September 22nd 2013 12:11 pm -04:00,It seems to me there is a difference between wrong and unnecessary that you are overlooking.For example a programmer might choose to use parentheses (though perhpas unneeded strictly speaking) when in doubt over precedence in a complex expression but that wouldnt make his/her code wrong. Likewise for the assignments the autograder doesnt care about the unnecessary things a student may have written nor whether his/her approach is the most efficient. And even in the programmes that you write I bet there happens to be unnecessary things that dont make your code wrong but rather improvable.As to your toddlers toy analogy your comparison would be valid if Hilda got the right result through bogus logic but it isnt the case., Resolved,2
Sunday September 22nd 2013 12:28 pm -04:00,I think its a given that extra brackets dont invalidate the functionality of python code.Given also that the Exercise grader appears to evaluate submissions by comparing them to a database of right answers unlike the Assignment grader which will actually run your code I guess the real question is whether the person making the list of right answers is obligated to anticipate and provide for students that add unnecessary brackets to their code., Resolved,2
Sunday September 22nd 2013 12:46 pm -04:00,Totally agree. My point was just that saying extra brackets are wrong is a bit unfair in this context.Now Id be curious to know why Hilda felt the need to write (s2) and why she put a space in s1.find (s2)..., Resolved,0

Tuesday September 17th 2013 12:07 pm -04:00,You guys are arguing about semantics. Jim did interpret the range of 1 to 10 to mean the integers from 1 to 10 inclusive. That doesnt mean theres an error on the slide. Since we are in a Python class and we watched the videos thats clearly not what it meant. I interpreted it as range(1) range(2) ...range(10) which is precisely what it is. In mathematics the statement would be meaningless in statistics the range would be the number 9 in mountaineering it would mean something totally different. In a Python class it was pretty clear after watching the explanation of range., Resolved,1
Tuesday September 17th 2013 3:49 pm -04:00,Absolutely nobody is arguing over what the code means or what the code does or what range means. Nobody misunderstands that but you keep posting sample codes or documentation to convince people of something that they are already very aware of. My only point was that you guys are arguing about the semantics of the phrase written in English on the slide. That seems fairly clear if not concise in the context. It could have been worded differently but the intent was pretty clear to anyone who watched the slide. And yes range(1) is very well defined it is [0]. range(2) is well defined it is the list consisting of 1 and 2. All of the integers in the ranges from range(1) to range(10) are precisely the integers from 0 to 9 inclusive. Instead of immediately claiming that theres an error maybe try the description was not perfectly clear to me but stop arguing about what the code does or assuming that people dont understand what the code does. The code is not the issue., Resolved,1

A ten year old can read the documentation and figure out what the code does. Nobody is claiming that the code should return 1-10 and the instructors did not claim it would.

Wednesday September 18th 2013 5:26 am -04:00,Yes its the slide for the lecture on range. And no the original issue was the meaning of the English phrase all numbers in the range of 1 to 10.

See my comment above about people being arrogant and condescending for their own personal satisfaction and quit posting code and documentation when nobody has a question about the code.

Wednesday September 18th 2013 9:48 am -04:00,Im having difficulty understanding Joshuas  reasoning...If I interpret the sentence fragment all the numbers in the range of 1 to 10 as non-technical user English then I expect the numbers 1 through 10 inclusive which is not the same as pythons range(10).If I interpret the sentence fragment as pythons range(110)  this is not the same result as pythons range(10).I dont see a reasonable way of interpreting that sentence fragment as pythons range(0 10) which gives the same result as pythons range(10).As a result I see Jims original post as credible and accurate and supported in detail by Toms posts. I cannot support the arguments to the contrary.In general I would expect English type comments to carry their ordinary meaning according to normal English usage and where there is a departure in intended meaning from that that it be suitably qualified as in  as implemented in pythons range statement or all numbers in the python range of... .  I believe this is a reasonable approach as requirements would tend not to be stated in implementation-language specifics and it would be reasonable to see such comments cut & pasted into source code., Resolved,1

An old favorite of mine: Hangman.The game should have a variable called secret that will contain the word the player has to find. Another variable called guessed should contain the letters the player has guessed so far. We also have to build some functions. One called print_secret should take as arguments two strings (secret and guessed) and print the secret word with only the correct guessed letters visible and the other letters as underscores _. For example if the secret word is python and player has so far guessed tnp the function should printp _ t _ _ n whereis in starting the game should print _ _ _ _ _ _. Another function should take the input from the player and validate the inputed letters (and/or symbols) and notify him if some are included in the secret word or not.Of course the code should hold variables for the guesses left for the player.The main game loop could be a while that constantly checks if the player has found the word or run out of guesses and inform the player with print statements.Have fun coding!,None,5

Thursday September 19th 2013 5:20 pm -04:00,Hi JacquelineYou do not need any kind of if statement or for statement.  The in operator answers the question Is dna2 in dna1? with a True if dna2 is in dna1 and a False if it is not.  Thats all you care about at this time is it in there or isnt it?  in answers the question for you you dont need to do anything else.  If you wanted to do something based on the answer then you would need an if statement., Resolved,0

Thursday September 19th 2013 2:47 am -04:00,If you read the instructions the suggestion is to set an initial value (working as an accumulator) to  0 and add one if it encounters a character not in ATCG. I think the reason you have to do this is that when the first character is in ATCG you get True and it ends. After you just have to return the accumulated value == 0. There is another suggested way that was similar but accumulated False.  I found that way more difficult to figure out. I hope this is clear and helps., Resolved,0

Heres what the tutorial over at Codeacademy had to say about it:Dot NotationAs promised well now explain the reason you use len(string) and str(object) but dot notation (e.g. String.upper()) for the rest.Dot notation works on string literals (The Ministry of Silly Walks.upper()) and variables assigned to strings (ministry.upper()) because these methods are specific to strings—that is they dont work on anything else.By contrast len() and str() can work on a whole bunch of different objects (which well get to later) so they arent tied to strings with dot notation., Unresolved,2

These are the only 2 statements that involve value so why not delete value = True and just make the return statement return True?, Resolved,0

Tuesday September 17th 2013 3:37 pm -04:00,This code will sum the odd numbers but doesnt stop when it hits the first even number because found_even is only ever assigned a value it isnt part of the for loop condition.

Try running the code in Visualizer and youll see whats going on. Does that help?, Unresolved,2
Saturday September 21st 2013 4:20 am -04:00,You dont need to add <not found_even> to your statement because as youve obvserved its redundant. What youre looking for is a way to exit an iteration after a set condition has been met. An easy way to do this in a function is by using the return statement.For example if you want it to stop after the first iteration insert a return statement after your total = total + num line. Remember that after a return statement the function exits., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 4:47 am -04:00,To check if a number is even:if num % 2 == 0: # if number IS even do this...if num % 2 != 0: # if number IS NOT even (odd) do this...As you can see you dont need found_even if you only want to check if a number is even or odd. However your found_even variable could be used to exit a loop or an iteration if used properly.Is this what you were asking for? If not please rephrase your question and Ill try to answer again. You can paste the code you dont understand why it does this or that and Ill add comments to each line explaining what they do., Unresolved,0

Saturday September 21st 2013 6:34 am -04:00,The difference between code 1 and code 2 is this:code 1 will add to total all odd numbers.code 2 will add to total all the odd numbers UP TO the FIRST even number it encounters.

That after the first time num % 2 == 0        # is True (or num%2 != 0 is False same thing) the if statement        # will always evaluate to False (because not found_even = False now)        # and the iteration will continue to execute the else statement until         # it reaches its end.        else:            found_even = True# 1 because when num == 2 else is executed and found_even == True1, Unresolved,1
Saturday September 21st 2013 7:34 pm -04:00,be careful Him  as long as you understand that the condition found_even is only ever changed when some line of code changes it. It does not change automatically when you read a new number. It keeps its value that it has until some line of code changes it.The best way to see this is to desk check your code. This is the best way to learn it but you have to be careful doing it. It is also tedious.The visualizer is really good for code like this too. Pay attention to the values. Using the visualizer to help you desk check your code might be a great way to desk check to see the progression of values through your variables.If you can handle it the debugger is a good tool too.  If you learn how to use and read this and simpler code then when you get to more complex code you will know which way is up in the debugger., Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 17th 2013 5:50 pm -04:00,You really have to read and try to understand the error messages. In the first example you need to put that piece of code into a function (a separate .py file). In the second example after the first statement the program awaits user input. However youve copied both statements and that is why the second one results in an error. Try copying them one by one.As for the last one. The input function returns a string. That means whatever you enter it will be converted into a string. In case you enter 5 for age1 it will be converted into 5 and assigned to age1. In order to add those two ages you first need to convert them into integers. Try figuring out which of those four code snippets do this., Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 17th 2013 7:19 pm -04:00,Perhaps there is further reading I could do but I seem to have a disconnect when it comes to returning the complement.I have the basic understanding an if statement.  if nucleotide == A         return Tetc.(followed by other if statements).But on its own it doesnt return a T unless I include it in a for loop using elif.  However it stops at the first run and doesnt do the entire string.  I assume because I use the return function it stops there.Can anyone point me to a thought or page to read to get to the next step.Thanks., Resolved,0

Thursday September 19th 2013 10:46 pm -04:00,When exercises are assigned I always thought they were meantto gauge how well we understood the material presented up to that point intime.  My strategy has been to resolvethe exercises without relying on IDLE too often in order to fully test my ownthought process.  During this week’s setof exercises I found myself testing many of my solutions in IDLE as a doublecheck before submitting my answers.  Howeverone of the questions during this round of exercises which I had not checked inIDLE contained something which I dismissed because it looked nothing likeanything we had seen to date.  Yet once Isubmitted my answers I was informed that the strange notation had somehowmysteriously yielded the correct result. I scratched my head and reviewed my notes.  Then I reviewed the lectures.  Nope. The strange notation was nowhere to be seen.  And since we don’t have access to futurelectures there was nothing to investigate further regarding this programmingcourse.  This was very puzzling. Expanding my quest for something more meaningful than thevague explanation offered in the exercise’s answer key I searched the Internetfor something which I scarcely could even query because I hadn’t sufficient backgroundto do this adequately. Yet eventually I stumbled upon something that offered aclear explanation.  We had just covered LISTSas well as the methods and means of referencing and working with them.  But regarding that strange notation it’s somethingthat we haven’t even studied yet but will get to when we reach the MATRIXstructure type which is basically a LIST of LISTS. C’mon guys and gals no more tricks.  Please. Let’s just learn and have fun doing it. I mean I really love to learn new things but get frustrated whenthings are presented out of order for no good reason but to addconfusion to something which is inherently confusing enough to most people. On a more positive note I found an app which runs on my Androidcell phone called QPython which “is a script engine running on android deviceslike phone or tablet. It embeds the Python interpreter console editor SL4ALibrary for Android which can make your android device run Python.” It runs Python version 2.7.2 which is several versionsbehind the one we use for class so not all the same functionality isthere.  But for the most part it worksgreat!  For many of the exercises this iswhat I used to verify my answers because I was at work and didn’t have access toIDLE., Resolved,4

Friday September 20th 2013 8:42 pm -04:00,The statement Cmon guys and gals no more tricks was not directed at the class members of this forum.  It was directed at the faculty who put together this course as a suggestion from one of the students taking this class on how to improve the material.  In other words I dont believe new material should be introduced in an exercise/quiz which is designed to test our understanding of the material presented up to that point in time.  Wait until the material is properly introduced in a lecture before testing us on it.  That was my point., Resolved,1

I now assume the code was intended to crash Idle to show us what happens if you are not careful. I hope the instructors were not trying to crash our computers.

Wednesday September 18th 2013 5:59 pm -04:00,heres what I find as a good approach.each of the lectures along with the videos has text that corresponds to the lecture.  I can quickly search this to find which video to review when I need to understand a concept again.More important that this though is each lecture is accompanied by a lecture summary ( under the info icon ).This brief synopsis functions in a number of ways for me.It starts off as a summary of the learning objectives for that lecture so I can try to figure out what is significant to note while watching the video. Having this printed out and available while watching the video helps.It also helps as a starting point for developing my notes.  I have a list of significant points in the summary that I can look at and assess if I understand what is going on at i) an awareness level ii) understanding level iii) mastery level and then iv) programmer level. This last level means I know the implications of that material how to use it how to assemble it how to pull it apart and what can go wrong.It really helps to have those notes handing when looking at the assignments and exercises and then running through the lists I can decide one after the other does it apply yes/no and then proceed from there.Finally when doing a review those sheets/notes are invaluable., Unresolved,5
Thursday September 19th 2013 12:19 am -04:00,Hi Annethere are a lot of fix-it & how-to postings here and they are all good.  On a more sympathetic note I was just discussing these issues with someone who had to decide to postpone a similar course because their course load was already heavy.It seems that programming can be difficult to start learning when one doesnt bring a framework of understanding known problem solving perceptions and familiar patterns of thinking to the task.Whoa she said that sounds insulting.  Well its not meant to be.  Learning programming involves new patterns of thinking and perception that one may not be used to and one may not have that understanding of terminology and relationship of concepts (framework) either.  Trying to see these develop these while learning programming and all that stuff that goes along with it can be frustrating and can easily eat time and shake ones confidence.I explained this to my colleague and it took a while to get her not to take it personally; its a difficult path especially when starting out. It can be rewarding but it does take time.So when you get past this course you will be in a good position to help suggest ways to overcome this.  Hang in there.  I had the same kind of problems on my first programming course too., Unresolved,1

Wednesday September 18th 2013 11:54 pm -04:00,Im confused by your output screenshot as this contradicts your assertion that potential answers output is the same as the while version output. There are cases where this is not true.There is a solution and it doesnt involve declaring a fault in the question.Theres an implied for all datasets in the question.  This would be difficult to prove by empirical testing.  You have to compare the logic at some point in your analysis otherwise you would be guessing. , Unresolved Locked,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 11:18 am -04:00,All the lists you mentioned above has only odd numbers in the beginning and even number in the end. Why are you assuming that one will only test with such lists.Even a list with random numbers is sufficient to test the code.By random numbers I dont mean odd numbers in the beginning and even number at the end. Random numbers obviously include combination of both even and odd numbers in the list.You have to test with different lists. Getting same answer for all the similar lists(doesnt matter 5 or 100 lists) will not validate the code. In question it clearly states always returns the same value not some times returns the same value., Unresolved Locked,0

Thursday September 19th 2013 12:08 pm -04:00,Rich In real time programming code is validated by testing it against extreme cases or critical cases (cases for which the program may fail). If the code passes all those case then it is said valid.Few such test cases for this question are - what happens if an even number occurs at the beginning between or middle and end of the list.As you pointed if a user dont know this and test only with cases as yours means that he has to learn devising such cases now.Your real world login script - just because one can also login using SQL injections we cant say its a valid way of logging in., Unresolved Locked,0

Thursday September 19th 2013 1:51 am -04:00,Thank you for clarifying your posting.  I did the exercise on Wed. afternoon (Eastern Time) and I had no >= operator in the suggested answers; this is the point I was asking about.I think I see what you are saying now but I dont agree with your interpretation.I think these kinds of specifications are interpreted as looking at the threshold value and then chopping off anything above that and anything below that threshold is not to be disturbed.  Nuking the playlist is out as is padding the list so all songs have 2 or 3 of each song even if the song is only once in the original playlist. Under your interpretation all those would be acceptable results., Unresolved,0

Thursday September 19th 2013 3:01 am -04:00,I think Rich understands the code and it may be that he indeed had >= on his instance of the question.The issue that we cant seem to resolve is in the interpretation of the cap threshold requirement.I agree with Rich that changing the list to have 2 songs when there were three of it is consistent with not more than 3 but I disagree that it is okay to monkey with the items below the threshold.  Its not reasonable to interpret replacing the playlist with one of Ted Nuget Arlo Guthrie and Boxcar Willie.  These will also be less that three but wholly different from the original list. Would it be reasonable to expect such a list or say an empty list in satisfaction of the request to cap the number of a particular song?The conventional interpretation of implementing a cap would be along the lines of the Merchant of Venice; you take what you are allowed but no more no less.The snippet of code that chops from 3 to 2 does give a list that has less than three but at the same time it does not satisfy the requirement to implement a cap threshold. The conventional approach is not to monkey with existing items that exist below the cap. This is the most reasonable interpretation. The code snippet in question does not satisfy these criteria.I can see Richs point that the code snippet yields a result that satisfies the inequality criteria but I cant then take that further to see that because it satisfies the inequality that it then satisfies the requirement to implement a cap threshold., Unresolved,0

Thursday September 19th 2013 11:36 am -04:00,The character you are passing to get_complement is what is stored in char in your for loop so you would need to change nucleotide to char to pass the character stored in char to the get_complement function.   Once char is passed to get_complement that function stores char in another variable called nucleotide. The variables only exist inside the function they are used in so char only exists in get_complementary_sequence and nucleotide only exists in get_complement  If it would easier for you to keep track of your variables you could change your for loop to be:    for nucleotide in dna:                complementary_sequence = complementary_sequence + get_complement(nucleotide)Then your naming is consistent between functions and you will remember what each variable is for.

Thursday September 19th 2013 6:14 pm -04:00,Regarding the problem statement of Question 6 I think some of the difficulty lies in understanding the question statement as well as studying the code.The while loop stops as soon as an even number is found and the sum of all the previous numbers is returned.The four functions below use a for loop to try to accomplish the same task although they keep iterating through all of the numbers in L regardless of whether the numbers are even or odd.  Only one of them returns the same value as function while_version.  Which one is it?Careful reading of this problem statement should lead you to create a test list that had an even number in it but NOT at the end of it.That way the while loop will stop as soon as an even number is foundBUT the for loop will not; it will continue to iterate through the list.Sometimes we make our work harder than it needs to be., Unresolved,1

Friday September 20th 2013 11:18 am -04:00,get_complement (notice the spelling) should work on a single character a nucleotide that is A T C or G.

Friday September 20th 2013 11:40 am -04:00,No you need to get the complement of each char in the dna string. The for loop is iterating thru each char in dna.

Friday September 20th 2013 1:16 pm -04:00,x is the 3rd parameter to your function.insert_sequence:(str str int) -> strThe first two parameters are DNA sequences and the third parameter is an index. Return the DNA sequence obtained by inserting the second DNA sequence into the first DNA sequence at the given index. (You can assume that the index is valid.) For example If you call this function with arguments CCGG AT and 2 then it should return CCATGG.

Saturday September 21st 2013 9:58 am -04:00,A short answer of course (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Python_software).Coding is one part but you also have to think about how your project would differ from the quiz/review type programs that already exists.  My suggestion is to consider the class video games and leaning being offered in Coursera https://www.coursera.org/course/videogameslearning. The instructor Constance Steinkuehler has done a lot of work in this area. Their project page (http://www.gameslearningsociety.org/) is inspiring.Are you familiar with codecademy.com?

Saturday September 21st 2013 8:28 pm -04:00,There is no reference to open a new window in this thread so I will assume you are referring to AKs comment to restart IDLE and check it again.Thats a legitimate suggestion. The two different snippets of code you present DO NOT RUN in IDLE.Since you are not able to take a hint nor some coaching here is a definitive answer for you:The answer you propose is incorrect. You have introduced a variable into the range operation which is not defined in the problem statement nor is there a possible way of incorporating your code snippet into the ________ space using a simple range(start stop[ step]) construction. You have set your environment such that this appears to work for you and have drawn the conclusion that it is a correct solution and are mystified as to why it is not considered correct.Now that you have the answer go figure it out for yourself.  If you have trouble the answers are up there in the post starting with Toms response and everyone else here who has tried to assist you.  When you have figured it out and understand each persons response to help you then if you have some constructive input well all be here.Good Luck., Resolved,1

Saturday September 21st 2013 6:08 pm -04:00,Well if you use the same value for s then s[len(s):11]Evaluates to s[16:11]And would therefore return the empty string since the beginning position is beyond the ending position. Of course you could change the step from its default of 1 to -1 in which case:s[len(s):11:-1]Would return marg, Unresolved,2

It stops after about 300 iterations but you can test the program on a small range of numbers., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 7:46 pm -04:00,Youre calling the same function inside its body (look at the second to last line). To put a bit simpler the function is calling itself. This is also known as recursion. Recursion can be quite useful but you also have to provide some way for it to end. If it goes on indefinitely an error will occur (also known as stack overflow). Thats what youre seeing in your example.Those two print statements definitely dont belong inside the function body. Make a .py file with the function and put those two statements into IDLE., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 7:53 pm -04:00,No idea what you are trying to do here.  The line print(increment_items(values 2)) is already giving your function its required arguments.  Lose the two lines you are asking us to execute.  Also your values statement indentation is wrong.If you want to test the function with increment_items([12]1)You would change the existing last 3 lines to:values = [1 2]        print(increment_items(values 1))print(values)NOT the way you have done.Nick, Unresolved,0

Sunday September 22nd 2013 8:39 pm -04:00,First you are trying to return a string True and not the boolean True. Second all of your variables for statements and if/else need to be indented. They should not be in line with def. So for example:def is_longer(dna1 dna2):     your docstring stuff!        count1 = 0    count2 = 0    for char in dna1:        count1 = count1 + 1And so on for the rest of your statements. Python is not freeform. Without the indentation it thinks your variables and all of your for and if/else statements are NOT part of the function definition. Hence return outside function. In some other languages everything inside your function is enclosed in braces and the indentation doesnt matter. Since Python doesnt enclose in braces the indentation does matter!Third consider using len() from the str: Methods: Functions inside of Objects video. It might make this simpler for you. :) Although this should still work as well when you get the syntax cleaned up., Resolved,1

I have made it so the output for empty strings is false as well as so its true as well as so its blank and 0 etc. as well as for ones that are too long (in regards to the complementary sequence and complement ones)And I have tried using a few methods first being the ones most similar to those used in the lectures! ~.~, Unresolved,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 7:59 am -04:00,I must confess that Ive always felt scared about learning programming languages. The fear is still there. I think many people think that programming is extremely difficult and so do I. Even before I try exercises or assignments I tend to think that I wont be able to do it. When I panic I can hardly focus and end up really not managing them. But when I believe in myself and am calm and focused I usually get everything correct. So far I have managed to get full marks both for exercises and assignments.Does anyone relate to this kind of phobia? :D,None,3

You need mental stamina and a strong work ethic the ability to get things done independently and as part of a team.  These things are more important than age -- 37 is young. If youre looking for the next big thing then one alternative that might interest you is data analysis and Big Data.  Check out Computing for Data Analysis and Statistics One starting on Coursera this week. The self-study class Introduction to Databases is pretty good too.,None,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 11:19 pm -04:00,Re: STAFF  As a result of unforeseen circumstances technical difficulties and differences in depth of understanding leading to late completion I would plead for an extension of the deadline for this Assignment. Some MOOC courses have a single deadline date for submission of all assignments possibly after the last week of classes to accommodate the busy individuals. Understanding that would be impossible for this course as it isnt multiple-choice structured it would nevertheless be appreciated if more time is allowed as some people take more than 5 MOOC courses at the same period. Again since participants in this course are from different countries and cities access to resources are variably limited. Hence the consideration by STAFF would be benevolent!, Unresolved,-1

Individually nothing about for loops while loops slicing indexing lists and list methods is difficult. Taken together all at once it can be a bit much to absorb. And then you get odd concepts like aliasing/mutability which make lists work differently from other things that weve learned before. I understand most of it (I think?) but its all unfamiliar so it takes time to get used to. When I do the Exercises I have to go slowly to make sure Im evaluating everything right.

Tuesday September 24th 2013 3:48 am -04:00,Im going to start by saying if it is not a text file I dont have any idea what Python might do when you try to open for reading.  Is it a Word .doc file?  If so see here:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/188444/reading-writing-ms-word-files-in-pythonAnyway here is what you can try.  If you are trying to open from the Python IDLE shell it will attempt to open files in your Python path.  How about copying your song.doc file over to C:\\Python33 or whatever the root directory for your version is.  That is what I did to make it simple for the file read and write tests.Nick, Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 24th 2013 2:13 pm -04:00,How can you determine that your result is different from the lectures?When you write letters = [z y x w]shift_left(letters)you are calling shift_left() which will execute the for loop as many times as the length of the list minus 1. The question expects you to step through the function execution (either mentally or using the visualiser) and stop at the 1st pass of the for loop body. In other words imagine what the first modification to the list letters is going to be. And you cant see that by running the whole function.One way you could try is by exiting the function right after the first for loop iteration like this :def shift_left(L):    first_item = L[0]    for i in range(1 len(L)):        L[i - 1] = L[i]        return None    L[-1] = first_item, Unresolved,0

Thursday September 26th 2013 10:15 pm -04:00,Not necessarily.  All of these types of applications are data driven so if you create databases for the info and if you get comfy with Python you can do the same thing.  Python works with several SQL databases.  Tom also mentions Access which is table-based (databases). You are really only limited by how much effort (possibly unappreciated by management) you want to expend on this project.  I did something similar at my company 25+ years ago (brought mainframe and paper-based applications over to PC workstations and then a local area network) on my own time.  Within 1 1/2 years management was ecstatic and I was given an almost 1/2 million dollar a year budget to continue and make enhancements.Nick ,None,0

Thursday October 3rd 2013 5:40 pm -04:00,Reserve the use of triple quotes for doc strings. That is what they are indented for even if they work like a multi-line comment. It is not too difficult to prefix each line by # or use IDE comment this block/selection feature., Unresolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 6:38 pm -04:00,Reserve the use of the word indented for its meaning even though it sounds like the other word you meant.Youre not going to be popular with the if it syntax-checks and runs then its okay crowd.Since you didnt quote any authorities I went looking to see what those might be.  So it looks like triple-quoted strings are actually multi-line strings which can be used for docstrings and it appears there is a difference in the way that the interpreter handles these strings.  My understanding from my browsing: Comments # comments are just ignored.  Strings are looked at assigned memory and then garbage collected if not referenced and docstrings have their own use.Thanks for your point above; it helped me to go and learn something., Unresolved,0

Thursday September 26th 2013 1:18 am -04:00,I just submitted mine and recd 37/37.  Have to admit that the read board function was the most convoluted and I made a couple of false starts.  Are you saying that when your run it with the a3_driver wrapper it works fine? AHA!  Note that your output is dropping the first character in each list.  You have 9 characters instead of ten in each case.Nick , Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 3:25 am -04:00,This bit me. Try deleting the last (empty) line from board1.txt - Id recommend pulling it up in Notepad++ and ensuring that the file is only 7 lines long when you save it.The docstring is accurate but the board1.txt provided is technically invalid per the doc -- there shouldnt be an LF at the end of the file., Unresolved,1

Friday September 27th 2013 6:24 pm -04:00,Dont know why some students are being so adamant about opening a file in their submitted projects.  One or the very first posts in the Asst 3 forum (A3 FAQ) stated it was not necessary.  Sure you might have a call to open file and close file in your code while testing it.  Mine reads currently: #my_file = open(board1.txtr)  read_board routine#my_file.close()Note that after testing and before submission the lines have been commented out.  As many have said the a3_driver file takes care of this.It is easy enough to see if this is your problem:  comment out these calls and re-submit!Nick, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 3:15 am -04:00,Im going to say that the reason people are hard-headed about using open() is that it was covered in the weeks videos. Explicitly *NOT* using a large chunk of the lesson in the code is counter-intuitive.The reason it wasnt used makes perfect sense from a security standpoint of course - they dont want anyone to have access to open() on the test machine especially since it could be used to open UNC paths.Im assuming they also dont want to cover with here., Unresolved,0

Thursday September 26th 2013 5:46 am -04:00,Hello everyone! I do not understand why my code is marked as wrong. The question was:What is the sum of the odd numbers from 1523 through 10503 inclusive? Hint: write a while loop to accumulate the sum and print it. Then copy and paste that sum.  For maximum learning do it with a for loop as well using range.The question explanation reads:Start by solving a simpler problem such as printing the odd integers between 1 and 9. Make sure that you print 1 3 5 7 and 9.  Then introduce a variable perhaps called sum that starts at 0 and in each iteration adds the current integer to sum. The sum of the odd numbers from 1 through 9 inclusive is 25. Then reattempt the questionBut when I do so I print 1357 and 9 and the sum is 25. Can anyone explain me where my mistake is please?

Thursday September 26th 2013 9:04 am -04:00,Mark there is no function in your code why would you need to return anything? Functions are very convenient in that they allow you to write code in one place only and have it executed anywhere you need (without rewriting). A function definition associates a name with some code. When Python encounters your function name later it replaces it with the value that is returned by the body of your function.In the following piece of code :def average(L):    total = 0    for grade in L:        total = total + grade    return total / len(L)grades = [80708592]if average(grades) > 80:    print(very good)the expression average(grades) will be replaced by the value returned the function. If there is no return statement in the function it will be replaced by None.Back to your code : no function call no return statement needed :-), Unresolved,2

Monday September 30th 2013 6:31 pm -04:00,Maybe you can consider that the shell provides an explicit evaluation environment. What is displayed in the shell (other than by means of print() statements) is implicit when you write a module.For example when you type 12 + 5in the shell it displays the value the expression evaluates to but if you write it in a module the evaluation result will only be known to the Python interpreter (no visual feedback).Back to your problem. When in test2 you wrotefrom_open.readline()it yields a line as read from the from_open file object. If youre outside the shell you have to remember that readline() returns a string (and use your imagination to replace this bit of code with the data it returns). Since you know that readline() returns a string all string related statements and methods are at your disposal :assignment		line = from_open.readline()printing		print(from_open.readline())concatenation		line = line 3 reads  + from_open.readline()string methods		uppercase_line = from_open.readlines().upper()etc...But if you type from_open.readline()in the shell you will be given with an explicit representation of its value.

If you want the backslashes to stand for themselves Id suggest duplicating them (D:\\Coursera\\Learn how to program\\Assignments\\Ass.3\\board1.txt) or using the raw string prefix (letter r just prepended to the string) : rD:\Coursera\Learn how to program\Assignments\Ass.3\board1.txt, Resolved,2

Saturday September 28th 2013 10:57 am -04:00,Just finished assignment 3 myself. Took about 60 min for the first 9 functions then 40 min for function read_words and another 40 min for function read_board. Came back 32/37 with all 5 failures coming from read_words and read_board but luckily I was able to figure out what was wrong from the error message and fixed one error to 37/37.I dont want this to sound mean because I dont want to beat a person when theyre down but even though I thought 3 of the functions in the assignment were trickier than what we are used to most of the functions were of a fairly straightforward format. It might look scary because there seems to be so much going on but individually every function (except for update_score read_words and read_board) is actually very simple. If you understand lists strings and indexes well enough to do the exercises you can write these functions. Just distil them down to their essence - this is a list this is a string this is the index - and then figure out which part goes with which.If you have spent 16 hours on the assignment and still feel like your attempts are shots in the dark I would put the assignment aside and go back to basics.

Clearly that is not something that at least beginners would tend to keep in mind while coding up the functions. To debug your code you NEED to be able to look at what was input and what was output and what went wrong in between. No matter how many times you watch lectures coding is best learnt through trial and error. But the assignments are not fully aiding that because not only can I not see the input and output I also cant see the entire error statement that python returned when I submitted my assignment but only some few truncated bits. I hope the instructors/staff are better able to take care of this going forward.., Unresolved,-1

Saturday September 28th 2013 12:33 pm -04:00,words_file is a reference to a file which has already been opened all you have to do within your function is read it. If you look in a3_driver.py you will see:# Load the words list.words_file = askopenfile(mode=r title=Select word list file)words = a3.read_words(words_file)words_file.close()What this does is ask the user for the name of the word list file & opens it. It then calls your function read_words passing a reference to the file that has been opened. When your function returns the file is closed.Within your read_words function you would use one of the forms of reading a file such as:words_file.readline()Does that help?, Unresolved,1

Read the beginning/the top of the assignment to helpsee what is expected.Feedback: Use the code visualizer theinsertion of temporary print statements and most importantly therepeated submissions of your code to find out what is correct and/orincorrect.

Hint: look at how this is used by board_contains_word_in_row.                            make_str_from_column: creates a string from the list of single character strings representing a column. Hint: this may be helpful for board_contains_word_in_column.                            board_contains_word_in_row: checks whether a word occurs in any of the rows of the board. This function has been implemented in the starter code.                            board_contains_word_in_column: checks whether a word occurs in any of the columns of the board. Hint: see board_contains_word_in_row.                            board_contains_word: checks whether a word occurs in any of the rows or columns of the board.                            word_score: calculates the score that a correctly guessed word earns. A word that is only 1 or 2 letters long earns 0 points a word that is 3-6 letters long earns 1 point per letter a word that is 7-9 letters long earns 2 points per letter and a word that is 10 or more letters long earns 3 points per letter.                            update_score: adds the score that a correctly guessed word earns to a players score.                            num_words_on_board: counts how many words from the words list appear on a particular board.                            read_words: creates a words list made up of the words from a file. Hint: to test this function you should open a file such as wordslist1.txt and pass the open file as an argument to this function. See a3_driver.py for an example of this.                            read_board: creates a board made up of the rows of letters from a file.

Sunday September 29th 2013 4:31 pm -04:00,Just thought Id share this to help out a little...Im working on Assignment 3 and like a lot of people am having trouble with the read_board and read_words code.  Thanks to Croitu Radu and his input on psuedocode I believe Im on the right track (and bless you Croitu for the help  ^__^).  I tried some code in IDLE and I got the desired result of nested lists for my board.  So I figured all I had to do was copy and paste the lines of code into a3 and done right?WRONG.  I got a weird error about inconsistent use of tabs and spaces - not the exact wording but close because I stubbornly kept calling up the a3 driver to catch the error message when it briefly flickered on the screen.  To fix the problem I had to go into my a3 file and re-enter the code line by line and save the file again.  Im still having errors just not the same ones.But my point is this: Python is a stickler for proper line indentation.  And with this programming language line indentation is everything.  If I were writing a while loop in another language say like the Cs it would look something like this: object oItem = GetFirstItemInInventory(oObject); while(oItem != OBJECT_INVALID)    {     if(!GetIdentified(oItem))        {         SetIdentified(oItem TRUE);        }     oItem = GetNextItemInInventory(oObject);    }The curly braces determine what code belongs to what statements.  If you follow the braces you can clearly see that the if statement is nested inside the while loop.  But in Python that same code would be indented and the indentations will determine what lines of code belong to what statement.  The same code - and Im not translating into Python just using the lines themselves as an example would look like this:object oItem = GetFirstItemInInventory(oObject); while(oItem != OBJECT_INVALID)      if(!GetIdentified(oItem))          SetIdentified(oItem TRUE);      oItem = GetNextItemInInventory(oObject);The if statement is nested inside the while loop and the line immediately following the if statement belongs to it.  The last line however is part of the while loop.  Now if the last line of code lined up with the one directly under the if statement like this:object oItem = GetFirstItemInInventory(oObject); while(oItem != OBJECT_INVALID)      if(!GetIdentified(oItem))          SetIdentified(oItem TRUE);-->      oItem = GetNextItemInInventory(oObject);Then that line would be treated as part of the if statement not part of the while loop and the only time it would be executed is when the if statement were true.  This of course would blow up the while loop and generate an error in the code.Also try to stick with the 4-space indentation when writing code in Python.  Its considered the standard and it will keep IDLE happy.  Trust me I know from experience.     , Unresolved,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 7:51 am -04:00,Python is a language that I dont think Ill continue to use now that Ive finished the course unless its mandated somewhere for me to do so. Some of the idiosyncrasies of the language are a huge turn off for me. Heres an example of one:Indenting. I do indent where it assists readability on everything write whether its C#/Mono a Bash script or anything else.. but in Python its hyperactive about it. If you have one space too many in an indented block it complains. This is counterproductive for me because I use multiple platforms and the number of space characters per tab varies so I typically just indent using the space character so that everything is the same no matter which platform Im on. And the number of spaces I use to indent varies to a degree depending on what Im doing - example being: I use 2 spaces for Lua and 4 for C#/Mono. I do this because going from one language to another can sometimes be daunting so the number of spaces in the indent assists me in keeping track of what Im doing and also because the spaces per indent varies depending on the community within the language (not saying Luas community as a whole accepts 2 spaces per indent but the community that Im most familiar with does). To me its odd that Python says hey your indent is wrong!  because thats a user preference issue in my mind. On the filp side I understand somewhat why Python does complain - it has no other way of knowing when a code block has ended than to check the indent as far as I know from what Ive learned in this course anyway. Perhaps this is an IDLE issue and not Python specific.. but thats what I know from this course.Its like liquorice - not for everyone.,None,0

Monday September 30th 2013 7:01 am -04:00,No words_file = open(wordlist1.txt)read_words(words_file)words_file.close()is only to be typed in the shell for testing purposes.

To get access to the contents of a file you need to open the file in your program. When you are done using a file you should close it.Opening and Closing A FilePython has a built-in function open that can open a file for reading.The form of open is open(filename mode) where mode is r (to open for reading) w (to open for writing) or a (to open for appending to what is already in the file).This opens a file called In Flanders Fields.txt for reading:flanders_file = open(In Flanders Fields.txt r), Unresolved,0

Is it much harder than this U of Torontos course?

Tuesday October 1st 2013 3:39 pm -04:00,HiIve looked over the various threads related to assignment 3 and I am still confused over this assignment.I have written code that successfully performs the operations however my code opens the file which is not required per A3 FAQ posted by the instructors.  I assumed that we should use the variables that are created by the a3_driver.py but the grader is returning the message that variable is not defined (Im using the variable words as shown at the bottom a3_driver.py).What am I missing? Thanks for any help., Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 8:47 pm -04:00,Let me see if I understand:  In the case of def read_words(words_file) words_file is the parameter of the function reads_words.  It could be opened with x = open (words_filer) and x.readline() would then read one line at a time (just like the instructor did in the lecture).  With the above two lines my code for is_valid_word works perfectly (of course Im opening the file which contradicts the instructions).  So in keeping with this example should I simply replace x.readline() with words_file() (and do so universally for all other functions as well)?  Thanks for the help - I really appreciate it., Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 3:48 pm -04:00,Not sure if Im on the right track here we may need a bit more info from you but basically lets take the read_words function.def read_words(words_file):     (file open for reading) -> list of str    Return a list of all words (with newlines removed) from open file    words_file.    Precondition: Each line of the file contains a word in uppercase characters    from the standard English alphabet.    words_file is passed to the function by whatever calls it. words_file is a reference to a file that has already been opened by the caller so within your function all you have to do is read it using whichever form of read you feel is appropriate such as:words_file.readline()the contract states that you are passed a reference to a file open for reading & you must return a list of strings which should be the words in the file.The read board function works in a similar way.Does that help?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 3:23 pm -04:00,So I used the variable (words_file) which I assume to be correct and received this error:  Method Description:NoneMessage:ERROR: NameErrorglobal name words_file is not definedIf this variable name is correct and is being passed to the function why is this error occurring?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 4:11 pm -04:00,The file is already open for reading you can read it by just saying words_file.readline()or whichever version of reading from a file you chose. The contract says:(file open for reading) -> list of strso your return value should be a list of strings each one being a word from the file., Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 4:18 pm -04:00,    (file open for reading) -> list of str    Return a list of all words (with newlines removed) from open file    words_file.As mentioned in the docstring the words_file parameter is a file thats already been opened (in a3_driver.py) so you dont need to open any file here. Also read_words() returns a list of strings so you shouldnt write anything to a new file but just well return a list of strings :-)If you need to test your function you can type something like :file = open(wordlist1.txt)output = read_words(file)file.close()print(output)in IDLE. The output of your function should be a list of words., Unresolved,0

Friday October 4th 2013 7:12 am -04:00,The argument to read_words() is supposed to be a file object i.e. an object pointing to an open file.A file object can be created by using open() or tkinter.filedialog.askopenfile() for example.If you write :variable = open(board1.txt)then variable is assigned the file object returned by open() and you can use the readlines()/readline()/read() methods likevariable.readline()     <<< returns one line read from the fileYou dont need to include an open() statement in the code that you will submit for grading. The game is fully functional without one because the driver file (a3_driver.py) uses askopenfilename() to create a file object for read_board(). But when debugging your code it can be convenient to create a file object in IDLE and use it to test read_board(). Like :file = open(board1.txt)output = read_board(file)file.close()print(output)Hope that helps :-), Unresolved,1

Tuesday October 1st 2013 5:16 pm -04:00,To check this in IDLE run your module (press the F5 key) and type this code in the shelll :file = open(wordlist1.txt)output = read_words(file)file.close()print(output)>> Then used a for loop with line in word_file.readline()Careful that in the expressionfor line in word_file.readline()word_file.readline() returns a string (read from the file) so its as if you had writtenfor line in some textand your variable line will iterate over the characters of the string.word_file is a file object that you can use in the following ways :word_file.read()		returns the whole contents in one stringword_file.readline()		returns one line at a time (as a string)word_file.readlines()		returns all the lines as a list of stringsfor variable in word_file	successively sets variable to every line in fileHope that helps., Unresolved,1

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 12:41 pm -04:00,Your method sounds right. As to your problem I can only make a guess : are you using clear() to re-initialise your list?

Friday October 4th 2013 4:11 am -04:00,Oops my bad I hadnt noticed you were talking about read_words() and not read_board().Your version of read_words() does exactly what is needed in read_board() : read each line of input and break it into a list of characters. That isnt needed though. The output of read_words() should be a list of words (not a list of characters). In wordlist1.txt words are stored one at a time on each line:CRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSSo you only need to read the line remove the trailing newline charcter and store the line.Also you dont need to use the sub_list temporary variable for that., Unresolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 4:13 pm -04:00,Fernando you need something more like:fred = open(filename r)fred.readline()When you open a file you need to associate that open file with a reference. It is then that reference you use when you refer to the file in reads and/or other operations..But having said that in read_words we are passed a reference to an already open file via the parameter words_file so all you have to do is use that to read the file., Unresolved,0

But Im going back to making strings from column again say for atleast the 9th time. And unfortunately the more I look at it and the more I try to modify it the more baffled I get.

Friday October 4th 2013 4:01 am -04:00,open(wordlist1.txt)is a good start. open() returns a file object which you can use to read or write lines but first you have to save the file object into a variable. Like this :file = open(wordlist1.txt)and then you can do line = file.readline()print(line)Also  remember that you can use open() in the shell only to test your function but open() should not be used in a3.py when you submit the file for grading., Resolved,1

Friday October 4th 2013 6:44 am -04:00,Very good!Now you need to get rid of the trailing newline character (). If you look into the string methods (type dir(str) in IDLE) you may find strip() or rstrip() useful.As typed in IDLE :>>> help(str.strip)Help on method_descriptor:strip(...)    S.strip([chars]) -> str        Return a copy of the string S with leading and trailing    whitespace removed.    If chars is given and not None remove characters in chars instead.>>> help(str.rstrip)Help on method_descriptor:rstrip(...)    S.rstrip([chars]) -> str        Return a copy of the string S with trailing whitespace removed.    If chars is given and not None remove characters in chars instead.Also you need to accumulate the lines that you read to a list and eventually return that list.Note : readline() isnt the only option to read lines from a file. You also have :file_object.readlines()            <<< returns a list of all the linesfor variable in file_object:       <<< assigns a line to variable on each iterationHope that helps., Resolved,1

Friday October 4th 2013 8:58 pm -04:00,i and item have no special meaning to python. you could use x or a or thing and they would all serve the same purpose. Jen explained this in the for loop video. i had the exact same confusion as you but rewatching the video made everything clear for me. variables in a loop are defined by their position in the loop, Unresolved,1
Friday October 4th 2013 5:30 pm -04:00,Make sure you arent adding any open fun in your .py file. And do not even think about specifying file name like wordlist1 or boardlist1 either. Avoid  tkinter too., Resolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 6:21 pm -04:00,See below for update that works...My apologies!  Please dont use this as it doesnt work that well.  It doesnt use normalized scores for exercises versus assignments the way my calculator (see Course Tools) does.  I started looking at this after emails between Etienne and myself.  I think the best thing to do is add this function to the calculator so it can use the percentages derived there.  I will look into this in the next couple of hours.Nick, Unresolved,1

Saturday October 5th 2013 4:46 pm -04:00,Well in case you are worried about the resolution : The resolution of the course videos is 960 x 540 but that should not create any problem in playing on your smartphone. In case it works slow or does not works at all you can use many converters and video editors available to render it to a suitable size / format for your phone.

Saturday October 5th 2013 10:26 am -04:00,Both exercises and assignments were an important learning tool for me. The exercises were where I got to try out and practice what was taught in the lectures. If I had gone straight from lectures to assignments I think I would have struggled with the assignments.I guess you can do the exercises by just pasting the code into Idle and not understanding anything but I dont understand why you would. Who can learn by copy pasting blindly? For the exercise questions I would work out all the answers for myself first without Idle. It was good practice. By the time I was done with the exercise I would be familiar enough with the material that I could work through the assignment smoothly by myself.,None,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 11:27 am -04:00,As far as I understand the problem probably lies with board_contains_word_in_row()Inside that function you should define a variable that will iterate through the rows of board and call make_string_from_row() for a given row., Unresolved,0

Saturday October 5th 2013 2:36 pm -04:00,Youre taking the right steps but my_file only contains a string (the filename).

Saturday October 5th 2013 2:29 pm -04:00,Youre close!my_list = my_list.append[word.strip()]append() is an object method which takes care of modifying the contents of variable my_list so an assignment isnt needed. You can simply writemy_list.append[word.strip()]just as you did in read_board.For read_board you are reading a line then reading letters in that line then stripping letters of newline characters but  only occurs once at the end of the line so youd rather strip the line of  just below your first for loop., Resolved,0
