Sunday September 29th 2013 2:38 pm -04:00,Hi there I am also having some trouble with both of these final functions.  When I try to run read_word I get this:>>> read_words(open(/Users/Rachel/Documents/python/class/a3/wordlist1.txt r))Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#1> line 1 in <module>    read_words(open(/Users/Rachel/Documents/python/class/a3/wordlist1.txt r))  File /Users/Rachel/Documents/python/class/a3/a3.py line 191 in read_words    for line in words_file:  File /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/lib/python3.3/encodings/ascii.py line 26 in decode    return codecs.ascii_decode(input self.errors)[0]UnicodeDecodeError: ascii codec cant decode byte 0xb9 in position 40: ordinal not in range(128)>>> I have no idea what the problem is!Here is my code for read_words:    words =     for line in words_file:        words.append(line.rstrip())                         return wordsI feel like once I get this I should be able to understand read_board but for now I am stuck., Unresolved,0
