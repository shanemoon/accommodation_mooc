Monday September 9th 2013 11:45 am -04:00,Hi I am trying to run some codes in the python visualizer. It would show all the steps(with frame and objects) but it doesnt have the program output box at the bottom. The visualizer is set to show everything which I assume would include the output.Anyone has any idea? Thanks a lot. , Unresolved,0
