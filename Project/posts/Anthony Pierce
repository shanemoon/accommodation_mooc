Tuesday August 27th 2013 5:42 pm -04:00,In the directions of each step it states that Please note: in a1.py we have provided the completed docstring for this function including example function calls with the expected return valuesWhere are these said docstrings? Also under EXPECTED_FNS seconds_difference is not present.EXPECTED_FNS = [hours_difference                to_float_hours                get_hours                get_minutes                get_seconds                time_to_utc                time_from_utc]Please show me what I am missing here. I thought we could use the docstrings for examples but if seconds_difference isnt even there then how is it even going to run?, Resolved,0
