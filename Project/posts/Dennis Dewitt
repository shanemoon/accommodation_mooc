Monday August 19th 2013 12:32 am -04:00,Hi! I am joining this course because I am trying to do the impossible and change careers at the age of 39! I know what your thinking but I did take some computer courses in college but then got a great job and was stuck in it until now. So this is the first step in trying to start a new career and path in my life. So good luck to everybody and anybody who would like to talk about this course give me a shout. Oh yeah I am from VancouverCanada so hopefully there are some old peeps out there who would like to converse! Good luck everybody!,None,2

Monday August 19th 2013 4:36 am -04:00,I agree that it does happen on some quizzes but it doesnt affect the ability to answer the question. If you cant see the answer that is overwritten just zoom in until  you can read it! It isnt that big of a problem, Resolved,4
Monday August 19th 2013 12:18 am -04:00,I am from Vancouver Canada and I am looking to join a group to help each other with this course. It doesnt much matter how we correspond just that we do! So I hope to hear back from some of you !Thanks                 Dennis,None,3

Tuesday August 27th 2013 4:22 pm -04:00,All my examples pass the tests on all my different functions yet I still only get 34/41 for my score? Why is that? could anyone take a look at my work and explain to me were i have gone wrong. Hopefully a TA would give me a minute to show him my files. Thanks for doing a great job here at Coursera !Dennis D, Unresolved,0

Tuesday August 27th 2013 4:28 pm -04:00,I know your going to say check those functions but I have  and to me they are pretty basic functions so I dont know what else to do but take the mark and smilethanks Dennnis, Unresolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 5:47 pm -04:00,hmmm well I am lost I am using interger division like I said... it doesnt make any sense to why it isnt marking those right, Unresolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 5:49 pm -04:00,To my understanding all that they are asking us to do is make functions ? That some of them are used together but not all of them, Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 17th 2013 8:18 pm -04:00,Hi Everybody   I see were you guys/gals are coming from when it comes to giving up on programming due to how difficult it can be sometimes because I used to think the same thing! Now though over time I have started to learn and pickup some of this and it does start to get easier. So I wouldnt give up just keep plugging away and one day you will start to pick it up. I am a 39yr old with no prior programming experience and a head injury that effects my memory so if I can get it  anybody can.As far as this question goes just read anonymouss  post about 7hrs ago it lays it out for you right there on how to do it. You can check your playlist to make sure the code is running properly by just testing it with a simple expression. Congrats to everybody for making it this far!Dennis , Resolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 6:28 am -04:00,Wow I didnt even think to look at that one thanks guys I have been messed up on my num_words_on_board for a long time because of that little hiccup. LOL thanks again...Dennis, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 7:12 am -04:00,I know there must be a better way to go about this I have this so farand it seems all wrong. To the point where I cant really think because I am so tired :(    readme=open(words_filer)    list1=    for line in readme:        newline=line.rstrip()        list1.append(newline)    return list1Thanks for the help, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 2:50 pm -04:00,I just regraded assgnment3 and i went from getting 30 out of 37 to 1out of 37?  I checked my file to make sure I didnt accidentally erased something but I would have had to erase a few things for that to change like that? Anybody got any idea of why this happened?Thanks                   Dennis, Unresolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 5:00 pm -04:00,I figured it out somehow I sent a3.py  from my dowload directory not my documents directory. So I have now changed name to a3_copy.py to avoid this type of confusion... , Unresolved,3
Friday September 27th 2013 5:05 pm -04:00,Thanx Tom I had the right way to do it but the autograder didnt like the code but your post helped me realize a different way pretty much the same but with diffrerent code that finally got me those last three marks. So thanks for your help!, Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 2:15 am -04:00,Hi guys my name is Dennis Dewitt and I am 39 years old.I am at a turning point of my life  where I am trying to change careers from front end loader driver ( got hurt and dr. Said my body is breaking down due to physicality of job  and to look at changing jobs ) to a programmer web developer or some kind of IT related job. You see I took a computer certification course out of high school called Maintaining and repairing computers. Suffice to say by the time I graduated that job was pretty much obsolete due to people just buying new CPU parts rather than having them fixed .  So to make a long story short I got a good job and stuck with it until now in a different field ( waste management) because of the good pay. During that time I suffered a significant brain injury  and although always wanted to go back and get some sort of degree was to unsure of whether I could learn with my disability.Fast forward to now  and Ive achieved something beyond what I thought was possible . Thanks to this course albeit I have to study a little harder than the average student  I feel as though I am holding on to some key concepts learnt from this course. So thank you for that!My question to you guys is:1. Do you think at my age with this disability can I make it in this industry? 2. What other avenues of education should I be looking at ( recently I was thinking of getting a low level Cisco certification). 3. I have lots of tools at my disposal ( intous iPad macbook with retina hp envy desktop Nikon dslr camera) with all this I would generally like to be a web developer as my main interest while trying to have a jack of all trades persona within all other areas of computers and the web. Do you think this is a good approach? I would appreciate you to be completely honest as I have thick skin and critiscm can help to make me a better person. Another problem is I have no friends who are into this field so how do I meet people to converse with and learn from because I cant do this alone! I got a family to feed to I need to figure out a plausible solution to what my career is going to look like!   Sorry for the long rant but you guys/gals have helped a lot and being fellow Canadians I look up to you and respect your opinions. Thanks for your time and to giving a person some hope!     Dennis Dewitt.        Vancouver BC,None,0
