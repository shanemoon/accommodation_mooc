Friday August 23rd 2013 11:31 am -04:00,I am missing the run menu on my Windows XP. I defined a function in a file and managed to load it into the new shell without the run menu but when I added anther function to the file saved it and hit f5 to load it into the shell it would not. Only the initial function definition was available. I should be able to duplicate the video menus with the same functionality on my IDE. Any way to do that? Thank you for your responseRobert, Resolved,0

Friday August 23rd 2013 8:41 pm -04:00,Well it seems that in the file menu there is a link to reference a file (it calls module) that does work. However one must type the file-name which is not as convenient as selecting it from a list as one sees on the video. The new window in the file menu does have a run on the toolbar but that is the text-file page and is not the IDLE. Im using a Windows PC and the one in the video is a Mac so perhaps the features available on one may not be available on the other. Anyway thanks Im sure itll not have any effect on my performance in the course. , Resolved,0

Wednesday September 4th 2013 7:40 pm -04:00,Well this is the only way I seem to be able to post a new question so please forgive me.Regarding the last three questions that require the visualizer I have run them through; I counted the stack frames; I watched the video lectures on the subject several times but either I am not understanding the questions or Im too dumb to count. , Unresolved,0
