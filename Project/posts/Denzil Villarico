Words may be contained in rows (from left to right) or columns (from top to bottom) but not backwards. When a player correctly guesses a word that occurs in the words list that player is awarded points according to a scoring system described in the starter code. The game ends when all words on the board that appear in the words list have been guessed.Please clarify as if I understood the assignment correctly the word list should only include ANT SOB and TO., Unresolved,0
