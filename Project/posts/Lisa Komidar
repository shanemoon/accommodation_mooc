Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:19 pm -04:00,Another suggestion that I have is it may help to provide an introductory quiz to those considering this course such as an Aptitude for Programming type of quiz.  It would test a persons ability to follow simple mathematical logic.  If you can follow basic algebra type logic then adding the programming language around the logic is easier.    If you cannot programming in any language will be difficult for you.,None,3
