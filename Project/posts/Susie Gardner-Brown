Friday August 30th 2013 1:06 am -04:00,I just dont understand why it all has to be so slippery! Why cant a parameter be a parameter. Full stop. And then an argument is an argument and nothing else? I dont know how Ill ever keep a hold on what anything could be!! Is there an overall list somewhere?!?,None,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 12:41 am -04:00,In the second quiz I really cannot get this one Add enough parentheses to the expression 3 + 4 / 2 - 7 so that the operations are evaluated in the following order: + - /. I just cannot get it!. I tried the following:((3 + 4) - 7) / 2  (this is what I think it should be!)(3 + 4) - 7  / 2 (doesnt seem right but ... !)I think I did try another combination but cant think what it was and cant see what else could be right!!What is it? Or - what am I doing wrong/not understanding?!!, Resolved,1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 1:01 am -04:00,OK Morgan - that worked - thanks! But - I still dont really understand how you (one) knows that is what was wanted by the original expression. Maths is not my strong point! I dropped out of this course last year because I couldnt keep up / understand! Its a bit worrying Im having problems in the first lecture <grin>, Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 6:18 pm -04:00,Thats useful thank you! And - am I right in thinking that exponents are like squared or to the power of ... ?Its funny that I have so much difficulty with maths! One of my ancesters actually invented logarythms! (Napierian logarhythms) - my mother was a Napier!, Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 9:11 pm -04:00,Yes thanks Morgan! I suppose my problem is/was that I expect things to go from left to right and be done in that order. I didnt  know that normally division comes first! Hopefully Ill be able to keep up despite my lack of maths!!, Resolved,1
Thursday August 29th 2013 1:43 am -04:00,Ive read through some of the posts here explaining variables and memory addresses and theyre useful - thank you! But - what I dont understand is WHY I need to know that! Surely Im just typing base = 2.5 to give a variable a value of 2.5. What happens behind the scenes is Pythons stuff ...Or is there some reason why I need to know this? (Probably - Im pretty challenged here!!!), Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 8:27 pm -04:00,Thanks everyone! OK I accept I need to know something about memory addresses! I surrender!!  <grin>, Resolved,0
