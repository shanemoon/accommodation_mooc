Sunday August 18th 2013 9:55 pm -04:00,Try installing a new Tcl//tk package according to the chart on this page.http://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/That should fix the problem I think.=)  Jen, Approved Resolved,5
Sunday August 18th 2013 10:06 pm -04:00,Thanks for the update. I hope this thread can help other people who have the same problem. =)  Jen, Approved Resolved,1
Sunday August 18th 2013 10:36 pm -04:00,Devin is correct thats exactly the difference. Thanks Devin for such a concise explanation!=)  Jen, Approved Resolved,1

Sunday August 18th 2013 11:12 pm -04:00,From what I can see after you defined the function you tried to call the function before returning back to the shell. You got a Syntax Error and tried again. But because of this the function wasnt yet defined.Try it again but this time after defining the function press Enter again until you return to the shell prompt indicated by >>>.  I think youll find that it works this time.=)  Jen, Resolved,11
Sunday August 18th 2013 11:25 pm -04:00,Hi Jen and Paul...Im wondering how many students are currently enrolled in this course. And is it more or less than the previous offerings of LTP1 on Day 1?=)  Jen Lee,None,6
Tuesday August 27th 2013 2:25 pm -04:00,Hi Doaa I was able to duplicate the same problem youre having on my iPad. I was able to work around it though by putting the keyboard pane down and then back up and then it types fine. I had it happen several times because every time I scrolled up to see the text of the question it would happen again. However I was able to complete the answer by the keyboard pane down/back up trick.I hope this helps you.:) Jen, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:00 am -04:00,Nancy you cannot assume that the community TAs are experts.When I took this Learn To Program class the first time it was offered I had zero prior programming experience except for playing around with my Commodore 64 as a ten year old kid.  I am now 38 and have not programmed ever as an adult.  However I caught on really well to the material Jen and Paul presented and I felt it was an excellent course. I did very well in the course and I helped people such as yourself on the forums and was thrilled to be asked back as a Community TA.Community TAs on Coursera are just students who have done exceptionally well in a previous offering of the course. I do not eat sleep and breathe programs. I doubt that Adrian does either however I dont know his background.  So please know that we are just trying to help you all without posting answers or getting too close due to the very strict Honor Code.=)  Jen, Resolved,3
Saturday August 31st 2013 9:36 pm -04:00,Hi Anonymous...I dont know which part youre having trouble with as you havent specified. But here are some general tips for this question:Make sure youre writing an expression not a return statement. Which means just the expression part like for examplea + bas opposed to a return statement likereturn a + bAlso the expression makes use of the given functionslonger()andget_capital()Therefore if you were to hypothetically uselonger(abcdefg bcdef)it will returnabcdefgand if you were to useget_capital(USA)it will returnWashington DCCombining these two functions should return the expression that you need.I hope this helps.=)  Jen, Resolved,5
Tuesday August 27th 2013 3:59 pm -04:00,This is perhaps the best explanation so far Ive seen of this question Gerrit!The two defined functions count_vowels( ) and count_consonants( ) are the ones you need to call in your new function count_letters( ). If you add them together you will get the number of letters in (word).Now the question is how exactly do you add two functions together inside a third function.Thats what you need to figure out., Unresolved,7
Saturday August 31st 2013 7:07 pm -04:00,Etienne youre right. That might just be the part that is confusing people here..., Unresolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 8:19 am -04:00,You need to supply the parameters but the parameters are  given.Hope that hint helps.:) Jen, Unresolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 7:28 pm -04:00,Right you wont really be able to test your answer because we arent given the body of the functions that were calling and they are not built-in to Python., Unresolved,-1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 3:42 pm -04:00,Jonnys got it right its part of the escape sequence. It doesnt behave like normal characters do., Resolved,2
Tuesday August 27th 2013 3:48 pm -04:00,Absolutely I think youve found the answer as posted below. None (with a capital N) is defined as a type in Python but none (all lower) is not so it doesnt know what youre doing when you are trying to define x = none., Resolved,3
Tuesday August 27th 2013 3:46 pm -04:00,The difference between Question 5 and Question 6 is the behavior of this line:>>> instructor_location = announce_location(Canada)In Question 5 it simply stores something in memory and doesnt produce any output.In Question 6 it prints Canada to the console.So the question is what would you put into the body of the function to cause this difference in behavior?, Unresolved,5
Saturday August 31st 2013 7:39 pm -04:00,Yes it does print the word Canada without the quotes I was just using quotes in my writing but I can see how thats confusing.To answer your question though the reason it prints it without quotes... think about this:>>> x = abc>>> xabc>>> print(x)abcHope that helps.=)  Jen, Unresolved,0

Sunday September 8th 2013 10:10 pm -04:00,Adrian I like it. Thanks for a very helpful post! I think a lot of people will appreciate that clarification.=)  Jen, Resolved,1
Sunday September 8th 2013 10:28 pm -04:00,If you look at the discussion sections under questions 14 15 and 16 certainly not everyone thought it was an easy concept.=)  Jen, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 9:54 pm -04:00,Sometimes the available choices are chosen from an answer bank so we might have not gotten the same choices.However of the available answers I get only one of them will fully satisfy the requirements of the question.You have to carefully watch the ifs and elifs to make sure that the code will be evaluated as you want it to. Some of them have indentations which will cause differences in the way the code is evaluated and some of them dont properly evaluate both grades.This question requires careful inspection of the code for sure.  But as far as I can see theres nothing wrong with the answers or the grader.=)  Jen, Unresolved,1

Sunday September 15th 2013 9:25 am -04:00,This thread is supposed to be about Question 4. Please stop posting Question 9 comments in this thread.Jeff - the question is about using indexing. Your solution while it may work does not answer the question.  There are many many ways to do things in programming but in an educational setting such as this its too hard to set up an automatic grader that would take every possible solution. Its important to remember that the instructors are trying to teach you something so we must read the question carefully.That said you are way overcomplicating the answer. The solution is much simpler than the answer you have given.And to EVERYONE: PLEASE be aware of the Honor Code and do not post code in the forum especially answers to the quiz.  Thanks.=) Jen, Unresolved,0

Sunday September 15th 2013 9:41 am -04:00,Scott you are on the right track but Nick and Tom are right. You need to make it one line and your index needs to be advanced. Theyve given you lots of tips there. Try again and good luck. =)  Jen, Resolved,0
