Saturday September 28th 2013 12:52 pm -04:00,Just something to note...I was passing in the fully pathed filename:c:\python33\board1.txt... and having problems opening the file to read. Long story short I was escaping the b in board. Im pretty sure \b gets interpreted as a backspace. I was able to use c:\\python33\\board1.txt without an issue.If I save one person some time posting this was worth it. :)-Paul, Unresolved,1
