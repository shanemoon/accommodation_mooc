Tuesday August 27th 2013 2:59 am -04:00,Hi CindyIt seems you need to change a setting to get it to appear as it does in the video.  I went in and changed one of the options underneath the part where you write your code shown below.  I changed it from inline primitives and nested objects to render all objects on the heap.  Let me know if this works for you!, Resolved,1
Sunday September 15th 2013 9:38 am -04:00,I agree. The FAQs now address this but it seems fundamentally at odds with the instructions which state: Return True if and only if the DNA sequence is valid (that is it contains no characters other thanA T C and G).If and only if cannot logically include .I am leaving my mark at 23/24 as I think the instructions are misleading., Unresolved,4

Sunday September 15th 2013 5:19 pm -04:00,Agreed. I dont think the example helped itself by being based on a real world (if baffling) example of DNA.  If the function had been called contains_invalid_characters I could maybe buy the fact an empty string should return False i.e. does NOT contain invalid characters.  But it isnt.  Is  a valid DNA sequence? I hope not!, Unresolved,0
