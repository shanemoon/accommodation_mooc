Saturday August 24th 2013 7:29 pm -04:00,Hello everyone my name is Patience and I am from Newport News Va. I have always wanted to be able to write code so I thought Id take this course to see if I liked it. I have never written code of any type before but after the first week it seems like I might really enjoy this.,None,0
Saturday August 24th 2013 8:57 am -04:00,I had the same problem! I was beginning to think that I was in the Twilight Zone because when I used the help function for the different built-ins it gave the module as built-ins but it wouldnt show them when I typed in >>>dir(_builtins_) I didnt realize that it was a double underscore! Thanks, Resolved,2

I have an iMac and I am using the Python 3.3.2 with no problems. To open and close IDLE I removed the launcher on the dock and opened IDLE and right clocked on the icon of IDLE with the ink pen and chose to keep it on the dock from the options buttons. The launcher wouldnt work for me it said the same thing so I just bypassed using it., Unresolved,0
