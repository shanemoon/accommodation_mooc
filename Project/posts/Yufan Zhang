Saturday September 28th 2013 11:03 pm -04:00,At first I use open function and got the error mentioned in the FAQ then I Â followed the lectures and import tkinter to use askopenfile to call the file other than the str for file path however then I got the errordisabledmoduleerror when I submit.Does this error mean we even cannot call function in tkinter? Then how can we open file to read rather than given a filepath str.? Im stucked for hours in these two functions.Thanks, Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 11:20 pm -04:00,Then how can you call the opened file? By assigning a name for it like file = board.txt? But that only gives you a string how can I know the path for the file?, Resolved,0

However I still want to finish all the exercises and assignments. But when I click the final exam button I didnt see anything posted yet. Is it not started because I enrolled late?Thanks, Resolved,0
