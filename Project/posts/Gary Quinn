Friday September 6th 2013 5:12 am -04:00,Hi Tatiana>>  so when you CALL a function it is always a built-in function right?Think of built-in functions as those supplied with the language.  Any functions we write are user-defined functions.  You can call any of them., Resolved,0

Friday September 6th 2013 5:03 am -04:00,Hi Anonymous.  Theyre asking you to write one line of Python that uses the two functions (get_capital and longer) and the two variables (country1 and country2).This should return the longest capital name.  For example if the capital of England is London and the capital of Australia is Canberra then you would return Canberra because there are more letters in Canberra than London., Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 4:42 am -04:00,The second example is less efficient because it requires more memory to store the extra variable and it requires more CPU time to put that variable on the stack and retrieve it afterwards.If the function is called just once every day then maybe thats ok.  If the function is called one million times every second then the extra memory and CPU time might become an issue.Tim and pickonrs are right in saying that most of the time it wouldnt matter which way you write the function so long as it works and the user knows whats going to happen.  Its often down to the style that the coder prefers., Resolved,0

Friday September 20th 2013 6:35 am -04:00,You need to look at the order of the statements in the code provided.  If this were a program in an .py file what would happen first.Would the error happen first or would the program print something to the screen?If in doubt try it.  Copy the code into a file and run it.  Or try it line-by-line on the IDLE command line., Resolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 6:47 am -04:00,In python 3 range() can be used to generate a list of numbers.  For example...list(range(1031222))  # try this on the IDLE command line to see what you getYou could use sum() to find out what that list of numbers adds up to.If you write a for loop or a while loop to work out the answer you might not need to use range()., Unresolved,0

Friday September 27th 2013 11:25 am -04:00,If youre trying to answer Q2 add a print statement before the if and run it in IDLE to find the answer.  But you must run the code exactly as it is in Q2 - I see from your screen shot that youve changed part of it., Unresolved,0
