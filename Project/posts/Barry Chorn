Tuesday September 17th 2013 7:24 am -04:00,I am still having difficulty with the following test: student: test_a2.TestIsValidSequence.test_is_valid_sequence_zero_length  The assessment registers FAILURE however when I run my code it gives the correct response:>>> is_valid_sequence()FalseCould there be a problem with the test for this? All other tests register SUCCESS., Resolved,0
