Saturday August 24th 2013 8:54 pm -04:00,Hi I am Eric; I am 26 I am an undergrad student in history but interested in developing my programming skills. I would like to ultimately program my own video game (yeah make no mistake: Creating games is what draws me first and foremost to programming. I rather be the next Will Wright than the next Mark Zuckerberg :^)If anybody else from the Houston metro area like to set up a study group for LtPtF let me know!,None,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 4:46 pm -04:00,I put in the code for the 3rd quiz question and my python retuned 4 as the value. What is going on:def sum(number1 number2):    print (number1 + number2)    result = sum(13)4   , Resolved,2
Saturday August 31st 2013 5:11 pm -04:00,I think I found my answer. The question asked: After the code has been executed what value does result refer to?.Only the return value gives a value after the function call. Meaning typing result = sum(13)will give 4. But inspecting variable result in the line>>> resultgives nothing. The video touches on this aspect at 3:30. If it was the return value then the codedef square_return(num):    return num ** 2would not return a value [say num = 4] after the input code of>>> return_result = square_return(4)>>> but if we inspect the variable return_result by itself we get>>> return_result16not a None type because we had the command return in our function def., Resolved,1
