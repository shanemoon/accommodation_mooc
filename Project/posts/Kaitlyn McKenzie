Sunday September 1st 2013 5:58 am -04:00,Hi! Ive just recently really begun to figure out Python. I was opening the wrong file- not IDLE- to do the work so Im going back and redoing what Ive missed.Unfortunately it wont run the saved formula for the area of the triangle. Ive saved it as triangle.py just as the instructor did. Then I restarted IDLE went to file opened the triangle.py file and selected to run the module. But to no avail. Can someone please help me? This is very frustrating and taking up a lot of my time! (I need to finish the homework and do assignment one for this class and then another assignment for another class but tonight. So its even MORE frustrating.) , Unresolved,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 11:41 pm -04:00,This is a screenshot of the Python Shell and my saved module side by side with two examples of the error code I am consistently receiving- Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#0> line 1 in <module>    area(3 4)NameError: name area is not defined. Ive clicked Run Module just in case you cant see it in the shot- I have clicked Run Module in the saved module window. , Unresolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 11:46 pm -04:00,Ive saved the module in a new window and clicked Run => Run Module as all F5 does is make my cursor unresponsive. It still wont run. , Unresolved,0
