Sunday August 18th 2013 11:36 pm -04:00,From other material Ive read its due to the inaccuracy of floating point numbers. This is not limited to the Python language. An example would be:x = 3/10;y = 0.3;if (x == y){ //both values are equal }else{ //both values are not equal }In this example the else block would be executed due to the inaccuracies of floating point arithmetic. The variable x would be something more like 0.3000000001 or something unpredictable like that. You can read another explanation here: http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/floating_point/understanding_floating_point.html, Resolved,4
