Thursday August 22nd 2013 5:34 am -04:00,Hi allSo Ive got a function for the planetary question:import mathdef sphere(diameter):    print (Circumference:); print (diameter * math.pi)    print (Volume:); print ((4 / 3) * math.pi * ((diameter / 2) ** 3))    print (Surface Area:); print (4 * math.pi * (diameter / 2) ** 2)(Thanks to Emin Mastizada for the import math function)My biggest issue with this is one of semantics - how do I make it print itCircumference: answerInstead of what is happening which isCircumference:answerI know it has to do with the ; that Im using to separate out the print functions in each line but if I replace it with a + it returns Circumference:31.41592653589793Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#86> line 1 in <module>    sphere (10)  File /home/glass/4.py line 3 in sphere    print (Circumference:) + print (diameter * math.pi)TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: NoneType and NoneTypeAny help would be much appreciated :),None,0
