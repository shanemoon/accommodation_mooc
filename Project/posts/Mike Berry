Tuesday August 27th 2013 9:38 pm -04:00,Can someone point out to me why personalpenguin  is returned without a space in the first instance that its used  but it has a space (personal penguin) in the second instance . The spaces appear to be the same to me in both instances. I hope this makes sense to someone.....what am I missing ? I know Paul states that  spaces have to be used but I cant seem to see the difference.Thanks        Mike, Resolved,0
