Sunday August 18th 2013 11:14 pm -04:00,Hi All:I joined for a couple of reasons it has been a very long time since I did any scripting/programming and I wanted to get back into it but also because I am a networking professional dealing with OpenFlow and some of the OpenFlow Controllers use python for programming.Stephen,None,0

Monday September 9th 2013 3:39 pm -04:00,It indicates both statements must be be absolutely true or both must be absolutely false.  If the fruit is an apple I will eat it.  But will i eat other types of fruit?  However If and only if the fruit is an apple I will eat it.  This means that I will eat apples but no other types of fruit., Unresolved,1
Friday September 13th 2013 2:30 pm -04:00,Years ago when I took my first programming class every assignment we did we had to turn in three things the English program the cartoon program and the code program.  The English was written sentences of what we were trying to accomplish complete with subject and verb.  The cartoon as she called it was a picture we drew complete with decision tree logic (pull out those old decision logic stencils and yes i still have mine and use it) and then finally the code.  While on short programs this was somewhat tedious it really helped understand what I was trying to do and what each step meant.  As programs got larger it made for a quick way to keep things ordered as well as finding which sections of the code were causing the errors.  I dont think you need to run out and try and find the old stencils but pencil and paper is certainly a hand thing to have before writing any piece of code if not for simple understanding and learning but for remembering what your thoughts were when you give up for the night and come back the next day after work (not that it ever happens to me mind you...), Unresolved,0

Friday September 13th 2013 1:14 pm -04:00,You probably have something like this:some codevar_name + some codevar_name = valuemove the var_name = value before the code, Unresolved,0

Friday September 13th 2013 2:10 pm -04:00,Hmm... that should not be the case with the examples or the grader.  It is not looking to reverse the complementary sequence rather just swap T/A and C/G as if building the second strand of the helix.  My solution did take CGATCGAT and return GCTAGCTA as correct., Resolved,1
Friday September 27th 2013 4:09 pm -04:00,I had a similar issue and it turned out to be the way I iterated my loop statement i never got to the end of the list., Unresolved,0
