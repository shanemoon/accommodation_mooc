Saturday August 31st 2013 9:15 am -04:00,to_float_hours:(int int int) -> floatThe first int refers to the hour second refers to the minutes and third refers to seconds.For example (0 15 0) means 15minutes which is 0.25 (1/4) of an hour.So it should return 0.25If you notice the pattern the number of hours is not touched at all.For example if I key in (1 0 0) it will return me 1.0(2 0 0) will return me 2.0And for minutes you have to convert it into hours. For example 15minute is 0.25 hour.For seconds you have to convert it into hours as well [if 1 hour is 3600 seconds (60minutes and 60minutes is 60*60 seconds) how do you convert seconds to hours]Does this help?, Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 10:47 am -04:00,Why are you using integer division?Like Ive said earlier. Given 15 minutes you have to make it into 0.25 hour which has decimal.If you use integer division it will remove the remainder and give 0 as the result. For example 15//60 = 0. Whereas 15/60 = 0.25, Unresolved,0

For example hello_there and helloThereSpecial names - there are some special names that cannot be used for example int double float etc.Variable types:http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htmSo far weve only learnt of numbers and Strings. Numbers can be int float long and complex. We only learn int and float (decimal)., Unresolved,1
Saturday August 31st 2013 9:19 am -04:00,What do you mean by same procedure? From what I know question 5 and question 6 are two totally different questions and the answers arent similar.You can take a look at the examples given to figure things out.    >>> time_to_utc(+0 12.0)    12.0    >>> time_to_utc(+1 12.0)    11.0    >>> time_to_utc(-1 12.0)    13.0    >>> time_to_utc(-11 18.0)    5.0    >>> time_to_utc(-1 0.0)    1.0    >>> time_to_utc(-1 23.0)    0.0, Unresolved,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 3:06 am -04:00,>>> instructor_location = announce_location(Canada)Canada>>> print(instructor_location)CanadaWhen you assign something to a variable there will be nothing printed out. But in this case something is printed out. Which means that there should be a print statement in your function.Also when you print(instructor_location) the string that you passed in was printed out. So your function should return whatever that is passed into it., Unresolved,1
Sunday September 1st 2013 2:57 am -04:00,Because there are 3600 seconds in an hour there is 1 full hour in 3800 seconds. It means that in 1 hour theres 3600 seconds - 1 hour has 60 minutes 1 minute has 60 seconds so its 60 * 60So in 3800 seconds theres 3600 + 200 seconds which is 1 full hour and 200 seconds remaining., Resolved,1
Sunday September 1st 2013 5:29 am -04:00,Perhaps through what youre trying to do with that variable.For example if I have a calculation with minus divide addition it has to be a float or a integer.For division the result is always a float if you notice. (unless youre using integer division)>>> def convert(a):	return a * 3For this function you can pass in an integer float or string and it will give no error., Unresolved,0

Thursday September 5th 2013 3:25 am -04:00,In step 2 youre getting the difference in seconds.In step 3 youre supposed to get the [same] difference in hours.You can get the answer by making use of your step 2 answer and converting it into hours.For example if your seconds_difference in step 2 is 1800 seconds (seconds_difference(1800.0 3600.0)) in step 3 youre supposed to convert 1800 seconds into hours.1 hour has 60 minutes and in 60 minutes theres 60 seconds. So in 1 hour theres 3600 seconds (60*60)With 1800 seconds youre expected to get 0.5 hr (1/2 hour).If you can figure out the calculation then you should be able to complete step 3., Unresolved,1
