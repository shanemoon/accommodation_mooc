Tuesday August 27th 2013 2:42 pm -04:00,Python has a lot of extensions that makes it compatible for every type of programming (desktop/web). Because of this for example from my point of view managers instead of hiring specific people for specific projects that require certain language they opt to make the current programmers learn python and just add the extension for the required project.For example you would need some .net developers to programm in C# but if your current programmers know python you can add IronPython which is an extension that lets you use .Net libraries but you program in Python.Other extension is PyPy or CPython or Jython (made in java uses java virtual machine but you program in Python which is faster and clearer code) or Django framework for web applications. The idea is that Python code is smaller and has a clear syntax. An elegant way to code.http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6964392/speed-comparison-with-project-euler-c-vs-python-vs-erlang-vs-haskell Since Java 7 Oracle implemented support for dynamic languages in their Java virtual machine since 2011 and Python is a dynamic language so you can understand that it is important. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine Python is the language that is used in scientific research being a the researchers programming language (combine with R language) if you are into scientific computing or something like this. It is easy to learn flexible clear.Python can be your first language to learn and its one of the most important languages to know. Other important languages are: C C++ Java Haskell Perl JavaScript C#.In school you are thought in this order (usually): C -> C++ -> JavaThis covers the base to learn other languages from above.C# resembles Java so you know most of it alreadyJavaScript resembles C syntax and you learn about functions tooHaskell is pure functional language i understand if you learn how to program in haskell it will make you a better programmer but also some ppl get frustrated when they go back to their job programming language that is a mainstream one and you write more lines of code with it :p http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8 http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Why_Haskell_mattersI added some links along the way hope it helped everyone that is about to read my comment :),None,12

Some teach you C# ASP.Net others PHP.I would like that more school adopt Python/C#/Haskell to teach as they are starting to become very important also Scala but this is more suited for masters degree as I find it to be a hard language.,None,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 4:05 pm -04:00,Computers are becoming faster but as Tim Roughgarden said problems also become bigger so its same thing all in all. The new way of programming from what I researched so far is the functional (Haskell) and also dynamic languages way alongside parallel computing with the multicore era that started.I subscribe to the 5-6 languages to know. Remember that a good programmer is one that has experience with different languages and uses things he learned in them to create better programs :),None,1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 4:37 pm -04:00,Very nice interview. Learned few things from it. Btw ive read stackoverflow comments and a dev of Python said that Python 3 should be fully matured next year or so. So expect 2014 to see compatiblity of all Python extensions rise up. Its about time.For Haskell: http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Brian-Beckman-The-Zen-of-Expressing-State-The-State-MonadThis guy is magic. Such clear explanations for a guy of his magnitude :),None,1
