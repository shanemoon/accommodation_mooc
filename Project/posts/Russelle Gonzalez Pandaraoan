Tuesday October 1st 2013 1:35 am -04:00,Hi AnonymousÂ I have the same code as yours and Im also trying to figure out what was wrong with the code. The update_score is the only remaining part keeps me getting 36/37. However the feedback report to me was a bit different (see below) from yours. How come?Method Description:NoneMessage:FAILURE: AssertionError2 != 0 : Wrong score calculated.Now I am confused.Russ, Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 6:47 am -04:00,Yes I did which actually resolved the error. To others please try to reexamine your code in word_score as well. Ive also learned that we really need to be extra careful. The code above is correct we also need to wait time before resubmitting in order that our answers be checked accordingly. Thanks!, Unresolved,0
