Tuesday September 10th 2013 5:03 pm -04:00,I got the questions wrong in the exercise about counting stacks but all of that is in the past now.All of the responses about stacks refer to the visualizer. I really dont understand the visualizer so telling me what a stack is by refering to the visualizer is using one mystery to explain another mystery. It does not lead to understanding.Can someone explain what a stack is by refering to a program itself. I see a program as a set of lines executed in sequence. A function is not executed when defined but is inserted into the sequence and executed with one or more arguments when it is called. Loops just go through the same sub-sequence repeatedly presumably something is changing with every iteration. And that is all I understand about a program at this point.What is a stack in relation to that?, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:28 pm -04:00,Thanks guysI will try to read that material tonight or tomorrow morning.The idle debugger is clearer to me than the visualizer (perhaps because it is not so visual). Maybe if I step through a hundred programs with it I can figure out something., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 8:29 pm -04:00,So a stack is all about a function?  One instance of a function executed with its arguments is a stack?The rest of the program that is not part of a function has nothing to do with stacks? Yes? no?  or what?I am trying to find some beginning point to start from and go from there step-by-step., Resolved,0

To me the computer is a black box.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_boxI have no idea how a computer works inside. And I dont want to learn electronics.  I know only that a given input results in a certain output. If an input (from within the program) stops execution and results in an error message or produces the wrong output then I have to go into the program and fix it and think through the whole program to figure out where else something might be affected.How can I use the concept of stack frames to help me in that process?, Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 8:36 am -04:00,In what circumstances when you are stuck does it help you?I mean is it all about a particular function not working right?I really dont think that experienced programmers use a tool like the visualizer.Perhaps they can visualize the program divided up into stack frames mentally.Am I stuck on a concept that is not useful when I see the program as one sequence of execution of lines?with functions inserted as a sub-sequence when called?This is really about the lectures and the questions on exercises trying to get at what they are talking about.Writing the code is the easy part of this course., Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 9:43 am -04:00,Yes it very useful to see line numbers.  Error messages show the line number of the error and you can go right to it.I use idlex just for the purpose of seeing line numbers.  It is an extension for idle.  Windows only.http://idlex.sourceforge.net/after you download  and install it you may have to go into the  C:\Python33 file to Lib to idlex-1.11.2to idlex  PY File right click and send to desktop to create a shortcutat last that is how it is on my machine  (Windows 8)In the code editor sometimes called a new window  ->Options   check  Show Line Numbers, Resolved,0

Friday September 13th 2013 2:51 pm -04:00,Well I didnt understand any of that.  But thats OK I will never be a professional programmer. Learning Python is for me just a personal challenge considering that I know approx zero about computers.Yes the python idle does include a debugger. It is simpler than the visualizer and easier to understand.When stepping through a program it often jumps off of my code to some other code somewhere that it uses internally and which I have no control over and no interest in.  My code is just too simple for the debugger to be useful. , Resolved,0

Thursday October 3rd 2013 8:08 am -04:00,thanks that workedI had assumed that the line   : [ ]  was from the beginning of the text file forgetting that a dictionary is not in order.  I also had a problem with file path. The instructor is on Linux which uses a forward slash as a separator in the file path. Windows uses the backslash instead but it is an escape character in python so I had to double it to get python to read it. That took me about half an hour to figure out. I am slow at these things. It seems that python is really made for Linux and leaves Windows users on their own to adjust to the differences., Resolved,1
Thursday October 3rd 2013 8:45 am -04:00,thanks AdrianI didnt know that about Windows. But in either case after I copy the file path from the Windows file explorer I have to edit it to use it in python. I wouldnt have to do this if I was on Linux. And it is not about taking the extra steps but about knowing what steps to take., Resolved,0

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 7:46 pm -04:00,Well that will certainly take some study. It opens the GUI just fine but I dont have the appropriate files so I cant actually test the program (no I am not asking you for them) I am trying to figure out how import data probably from a csv file running it through a function and displaying the result. I am thinking of scientific data. For the moment I am interested in weather data. Quantifying climate change. There is quite a bit of data available usually as a table of numbers in a text file sometimes csv sometimes in a spreadsheet. I really am a beginner with Python and for a GUI  tkinter seems like a good starting place.  I do have PyQt as another option. But I need to get better with Python itself first., Unresolved,0
