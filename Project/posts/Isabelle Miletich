Monday August 26th 2013 7:19 pm -04:00,If I type 5+7 in the window and then execute a window opens with nothing in it. However if I type print(5+7) then a window opens with 12 in it. From what I have understood in the lectures it does not work the same in Idle where you only have to type 5+7 and enter to get the same result. Can someone please explain the difference?, Unresolved,0
