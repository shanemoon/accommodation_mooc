Thursday September 5th 2013 11:21 am -04:00,Switched th html and for at least the last 3 lectures for week 3 it functioned properly.  Thanks for the note.. should have tried that first!, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 8:15 pm -04:00,I seem to have some of the similar problems mentioned here...in the code that I submitted I had a test for null input which returned a null string and I also tested for long strings with multiple occurences of ALL of the nucleotides in the same string...but i still only received (I think it was) 21/24.  Please help me to understand what it is that the grading is saying that Im missing., Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 10:27 pm -04:00,I thought to add the errors that I received: Seemingly like the problems that others have had above all of my testing resulted in the correct answers...testing for no input testing for lower case input testing combination of upper and lower case inputs (with combinations of nucleotides and non-nucleotides alike) long string input short string input the handout example input.  I dont understand why Im only receiving 21/24...student: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_handout_examplestudent: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_longstudent: test_a2.TestGetComplement.test_get_complement, Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 7:37 am -04:00,I must just be daft...None!=TA doesnt tell me anything personally other than what we learned already...None is not equal to TA...again I tested my function with the input and my output was correct AT...is this a problem with the grader somehow?, Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 7:52 am -04:00,Understood...I appreciate your attempt at helping.   Unfortunately I still dont know what to do...my codereturns the correct output when I run it.  I cant test and fix something that is  as far as I see is not broken :(, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 10:41 pm -04:00,Ok...did I just get mine marked wrong due to the fact that I only provided the while loop portion of the defined function per the directions? Hint: write a while loop to accumulate the sum and print it.I merely gave precisely what was asked for and only what was asked for (didnt include my entire function).  My function worked correctly but it wouldnt be the first time that got an answer that did what it was supposed to and got marked wrong (and yes I tested the function extensively)I was also confused by the directions...Then copy and paste that sum....didnt know what to do with that at all..., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 7:19 am -04:00,That seems silly to just give your number answer...I did a check of the math in excel in 30 sec to make sure I was getting the correct output from my code...thanks for the clarification of what was actually being asked for though!, Unresolved,0
