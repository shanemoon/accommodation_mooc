Wednesday August 28th 2013 6:16 pm -04:00,Ive enjoyed reading this thread. In fact ALL the threads have been interesting to read whether I really needed to or not.  One thing I will say I have a NEW word in my vocabulary. That being pedantic.PEDANTIC: 1. :of relating to or being a pedant(see pedant). 2. : narrowly stodgily and often ostentatiously learned. 3. : unimaginative pedestrian. — pe·dan·ti·cal·ly‎Stodgy - ‎Ostentatious - ‎Pedestrian - ‎Pedantical, Resolved,1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 5:30 pm -04:00,Its been explained well yet I will attempt to better clarify whats been posted.In the first example using the print function/string the result is plain to see.  The output is simply how you would expect ieHoware you?For me to print the above How are you? I had to literally press the <ENTER> key after How then again after are and then after you?.When we create a variable between the quotation marks it literally denotes what each new line (our <ENTER>) and replacing it as  . The  is how the variable accounts for each new line (our <ENTER>)Therefore when we assign variable s to equalHowareyou?to account for each line the result we get is Howareyou?I hope I didnt oversimplify this for you and I hope it helps!, Resolved,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 1:24 pm -04:00,After watching this video and trying to replicate the results I wasnt able to and have a question as to the IDLE itself.In the video at 00:37 the professor does something to have a split screen showing on the video as he demonstrates how to write a doc string.  What keys are used to follow along to cause IDLE to have the same image?  Ive seen it in earlier lesson videos too., Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 10:33 pm -04:00,Thank You for your Post.  Thats a great explanation.  One more thing: is there a way to clear out code you have written in IDLE to get to a fresh screen?  What Ive done to get a clean screen is exit the program and reopen it but Im sure there is a much simpler solution., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 5:50 pm -04:00,Im also having trouble with getting this code in IDLE.  Ive right-clicked on the a1.py icon and a box does appear but nowhere does it say edit in IDLE.  Im using Windows 7., Resolved,0
