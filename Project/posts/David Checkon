Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:37 am -04:00,This particular question had me muddled up a bit. I had written a one line expression but it wasnt correct. I tried a second time a different way and that was wrong too. Now upon reading the posts I see what Ping had done. I had the functions backwards dunno if that matters. So does the order of the functions matter? Im presuming it does. Which begs the question how do you know which function to place first second third etc? , Unresolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 10:56 pm -04:00,I am not  sure  what to make of this issue. I entered the four statements in IDLE and it came back with one correct answer. However I am marked incorrect. I attempted this a few times and still received the incorrect markings. When I saw the second answer I was perplexed as to why this would be incorrect as I did enter the code correctly as seen below.  Any ideas as to why this occured?EDIT: Screenshots are too small. The code in question is boxed in red and the result I get is Call Me PePerhaps, Resolved,0

Wednesday September 18th 2013 11:00 pm -04:00,While (no pun intended) watching the while loops lecture I kept getting a wee bit confused over this particular bit of code:s[i]What do the brackets indicate in this format? I went back thru my notes trying to figure it out and I cannot recall what this means or indicates. And when to use the brackets in this manner. When I see brackets I think lists. , Unresolved,0
