Thursday September 26th 2013 6:52 am -04:00,Hey guys Im a little confused by this line as well. Assuming that using expression grade = line[ line.rfind(   ) + 1 : ]we must reach the last character of the string variable line which in this case is /n( readline() function returns a string including the /n character) the grade variable must contain a value like 950/n What do I get wrong?, Unresolved,0

Even people with a reasonable programming background had a tough time doing some course exercises. So I think its much  harder that this introductory course  and u have to be expecting to dedicate a fair bunch of your time to pass the MIT course.,None,0
