Sunday September 22nd 2013 5:34 am -04:00,I tried the DNA assignment (2nd assignment) this way:ATGC = TACGdef get_complementary_sequence(dna):    return eval(+.join(list(dna))) if dna else NoneIt works just fine in IDLE but the auto assessment engine reports an ERROR/FAILUREAs I tried in pythontutor.com it said: NameError: global name eval is not definedError as show on the results page:student: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_handout_exampleERRORstudent: test_a2.TestGetComplementarySequence.test_get_complementary_sequence_longERRORstudent: test_a2.TestGetComplement.test_get_complementP.S.: I posted the code here since it would not get evaluated by the auto assessment engine anyway! Hence I think it doesnt break the honor code., Unresolved,0

I was being haunted by this question since my first online code submission in different online code compilers. Since I came across the same thing again I just thought I would find an answer here!, Unresolved,0
