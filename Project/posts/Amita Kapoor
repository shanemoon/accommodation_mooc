Sunday September 15th 2013 10:28 am -04:00,I face the same error message: IDLEs subprocess didnt make connection. Either IDLE cant start a subprocess or personal firewall software is blocking the connection since i blocked Python from internet. My question is why python needs to go to internet? What information does it exchange and with which server. Can anybody please enlighten, Resolved,0

But in second when I answer with the value it says it is wrong! The question in both cases is: What value does x refer to?Screenshot:,None,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:27 pm -04:00,In both questions the division is of form x=y / z. Both y and z are integers. And solution is a float number in one case it is rational real number of only two digits and in next it is irrational real number. As per quiz marking scheme it gives me full marls for rational real number and zero for irrational real number. I tried entering both the truncated as well as rounded version of the irrational real number.I am using Python 3.3.2In explanation it does tell the value except mention that it will be float type.,None,0
