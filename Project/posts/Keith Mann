Wednesday October 2nd 2013 12:40 pm -04:00,As an enterprise architect with 30+ years of programming experience I took this course not to learn to program but to better understand the way in which university students are being taught programming these days.I was encouraged by the structured approach to developing functions that was introduced early in the course in which a set of tests was written first. I also liked the focus on the contract at least in terms of arguments return and preconditions. This seemed to lay the foundation for some excellent programming practices such as test-driven design.I dont understand then why this lecture abandoned that approach.Â , Unresolved,1
