Tuesday August 20th 2013 6:57 am -04:00,I mean do we get penalized if we answer the questions more than once after completing parts of the quiz? Im asking because I was in the process of answering the questions when I accidentally closed my window and had to start over after reopening the browser and reloading the video. I have gotten all my questions correct so far so this was not related to trying to improve my scores just in case you were wondering.  :)Finally is there a limit to the number if times I can answer the quizzes?P.S Can someone move this question to the forum Exercises and Assignments? After I published it I realized that would be a much better sub-forum and cant find a way to move it myself., Resolved,1

Sunday September 15th 2013 6:58 am -04:00,I still dont get it if this question only works with 10 to find the correct answer then why not state that x = 10 instead of saying x = int ?, Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 7:02 am -04:00,To make myself clear: I understand why the results are different when we use the 10 what I dont understand is why not state that we should use that number to find the answer instead of just saying x = int., Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 10:40 am -04:00,I guess I dont understand after all as I got this question wrong :(, Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 11:09 am -04:00,Not sure how but I got it right. Although I got it right Im not sure I am happy because I am not sure I understood how to achieve the correct answer.  For now I will take the points and move on I hope this wont complicate things in the future and stop me from understanding other concepts related to this., Resolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 3:39 am -04:00,Hi: I am somewhat behind on the schedule and I am trying to finish assignment 1 before the extended deadline expires (September 11). I did the first 4 steps relatively quickly and easily but I am stuck with step 5 basically because I cant make any sense of the instructions. I am totally confused as to what they want me to do here. I have to write the three functions first and then use them to make  to_24_hour_clock(hours):   work?? Please help!!!, Resolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 4:45 am -04:00,So after I complete get_hours I have to insert it into to_24_hour_clock(hours) ?, Resolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 7:00 am -04:00,Hi Etienne: I have gotten most of the things solved for step5 but now I get an assertionerror on get_hours. I already read the info about assertionerror posted by others who were having the same problem and I still cant get it., Resolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 8:02 am -04:00,Hey EtienneI did it! I just forgot to thank you and mark this as resolved as I had already started working on step 6!  :)For others that are having trouble with step 5 this thread here is the one that helped me the most to both solve my error and answer most of the questions I had :https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1504, Resolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 7:31 am -04:00,I had submitted assignment 1 several times when I suddenly noticed this statement at the bottom of the page:You can resubmit a1.py once every hour. Your maximum score will count. Notice that this means that you can submit a lot of times before the due date if you start early. You can even submit before youve finished all of the functions although the feedback will be incomplete.Does that mean that I will get penalized for submitting my incomplete assignment more than once per hour?I thought we could submit the assignment as many times as we wanted in order to try to get the best score possible. I am currently submitting it every time I conclude a step and more if I notice something is wrong., Resolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 7:47 am -04:00,Thanks Etienne: I was worried I would get penalized. Even though I may submit more than once per hour I try to submit only when I feel I have substantially changed my code or when I have found a solution to an error so I dont think I will cause the autograder any problem., Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 9:53 am -04:00,Note: we omitted docstrings in this code to save space. Dont do this in your own code!Does this mean I have to write the docstring for all three functions definitions? Do I have to use the Edit code link on the visualizer to do this correctly?(This question actually applies to questions 1415 and 16), Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 10:15 am -04:00,If thats the case this is turning to be waaaay more complicated than I expected its giving me a headache and taking me way too long to  write those docstrings. It might be worth it to just forfeit those three questions., Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 11:14 am -04:00,Now I understand why I got them right even without the docstrings thanks!  Still I think getting these answers right was partially kind of a lucky guess because I am not sure I coded everything correctly. Furthermore I got question 14 until the second try and Im not sure I used the right procedure or just guessed right. , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 4:37 am -04:00,yes string slicing and list slicing are 2 different things  a slice of a list is still a listWow I am sure that remembering this simple explanation will save me a lot of headaches in the near future thanks Tom Enos for the brilliant analysis and simple answer., Resolved,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 2:12 am -04:00,The writing files video has sound issues I dont remember around which minutes. I also noticed the problem in several videos in the previous weeks but I thought that you already knew about it and were working on correcting them. Maybe after the course concludes I will re-watch the videos and I can write down which other videos have issues., Unresolved,0
