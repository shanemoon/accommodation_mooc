Saturday August 24th 2013 2:30 pm -04:00,I am using a Mac OS OS X 10.8.4 (12E55) and Python 3.3.2.  I do not see a RUN command or drop down menu that was referenced in the video lectures.  This version seems to be different.  Please Advise., Unresolved,0
Saturday August 24th 2013 6:21 pm -04:00,Ok I looked at the FAQ and found that I was looking for RUN under the wrong window but now I ran and it gives what appears to be a memory address for Area and Perimeter., Unresolved,0
Saturday August 24th 2013 6:39 pm -04:00,Ok thanks  I works as expected now and returned the 12 value that I saw in the video., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 12:21 am -04:00,So I am having trouble with the Step 6def time_to_utc(utc_offset time):I tried many different variations and spent hours on experimentation but did not come up with anything that worked.  I am running out of time.  I have work tomorrow so will not be able to spend any more time on this.The latest experimentreturn (to_24_hour_clock - utc_offset)gives me the following errors>>> time_to_utc(1 12)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#99> line 1 in <module>    time_to_utc(1 12)  File /Users/richardbaker/Downloads/a1.py line 121 in time_to_utc    return (to_24_hour_clock - utc_offset)TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: function and intI dont know what this means but looks  like it can not subtract a function from an int so dont know what I am doing.I tried to insert get hours get minutes and get seconds in this formula instead of to_24_hour_clock but got equally poor results.Please advise., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:17 am -04:00,OK I got the time_to_utc to work by looking at the to_24_hour_clock as a model.  when I applied the % 24 following the formula it worked in all sample scenarios.  So now time to move on to the next., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 3:07 pm -04:00,I had the problem as well but I think I fixed it by using the Indent and Dedent under the format menu.  But I have another problem.  The function is not returning the correct answer and the last  after the aeiouAEIOU is not green but rather black.  I dont see what the problem is.  The code looks correct to me.def count_vowels(s):      (str) --> intcoun    Return the number of vowels in s. Do not treat the letter y as a vowel.    >>> count_vowels(Happy Anniversary!)    5    >>> count_vowels(xyz)    0        num_vowels = 0    for char in s:        if char in aeiouAEIOU:            num_vowels = num_vowels + 1        return num_vowelswhen tested >>> count_vowels(Happy Anniversary!)0This is not the correct answerPlease Advise, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 3:21 pm -04:00,Ok that seemed to work.>>> count_vowels(Happy Anniversary!)5but the last  is still black not green ( which seems odd)Is there some mechanism that lets you know of alignment issues  I did not think the actual alignment of the indent and dedent was that important.  I dont remember it to be important in Java Script ( though I am a novice at Jscript as well).seems like watching for alignment is added complexity that could easily mess a human up., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 3:33 pm -04:00,Already - then a hidden got-ya!  Its easy to miss an indent.  Must be why they have the format indent and dedent capability., Unresolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 12:31 am -04:00,    is_valid_sequence = True    for char in dna:        if char not in ATCG:            is_valid_sequence = False        return is_valid_sequenceThis code is working part of the time but fore one test case  is_valid_sequence(AZTGGCF) is returning a True and it should be False.Please Advise., Resolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 11:17 pm -04:00,Hum is there a simple answer.  I dont have it working yet but I am looking at the lecture.Seems like its a simplereturn nucleotide.count(dna)At least the lecture 4 str Methods:  Functions Inside of Objects.The lecture talks about white_rabbit.count(ate) giving the answer of 3 where white_rabbit was defined as a certain sentence or string of letters.So far I am getting a 0 for my count_nucleotides(ATCGGC G) test though. this is frustrating since it should work., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 11:22 pm -04:00,Ok that was it.  I got the right answer now.  Thanks, Unresolved,1
