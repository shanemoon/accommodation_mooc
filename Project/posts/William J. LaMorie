Monday August 19th 2013 4:13 pm -04:00,HiJust wondering if this course offers a with distinction on the completion certs of those who do very well and if so what the minimum grade is to earn distinctions.Thanks! =),None,1
Tuesday August 20th 2013 8:41 am -04:00,Thanks for the reply David!I did look at the logistics page before asking in the forum however Ive taken a Coursera class in the past that did not have a with distinction criteria listed but that ended up having a threshold for a distinction so I felt Id ask! Thanks again for the clarification!,None,1
Tuesday September 10th 2013 4:08 pm -04:00,Hi PaulI saw that the last offering of Learn to Program: Crafting Quality Code is still open... if you arent planning on running it again have you considered moving it over to a self study course?,None,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 11:45 pm -04:00,I got a point off on this test-test_a3.Test_07_BoardContainsWordInColumn.test_05_word_end_colMethod Description:NoneMessage:ERROR: IndexErrorlist index out of rangeand I dont get why I did... the only way I could replicate getting a list out of range is by making the row lists of uneven length... I sort of presumed from the grid layout of the example that they would all be the same length (I.E. there wouldnt be any rows that were truncated before the rest of the rows such as-AAAAAAAAAAAAAA )again Ive not been able to replicate it with out those conditions. Im using the length of a given row to determine the range... any thoughts?, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 8:29 am -04:00,I get correct responses for all your cases here. Starting to wonder if I should bump this over to the bug thread... or just try a resubmit as it is could just be some random glitch., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 8:28 am -04:00,Hi GeorgeIm already using len(foo[index]) in my range() and did at time of submission... just trying to avoid using code snippets in the forums., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 8:34 am -04:00,Update:when I changed range(len(board[number]) to -1 I get the point. Im going to guess this means that one of the test cases it might pull for the test is NOT a rectangle. Im going to post this to the bug forum in case this is not intentional., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 8:41 am -04:00,The problem summary:I got a point off on this test-test_a3.Test_07_BoardContainsWordInColumn.test_05_word_end_colMethod Description:NoneMessage:ERROR: IndexErrorlist index out of rangeI was unable to reproduce the issue with a whole slue of test cases... tons. I had been using range(len(board[0])) to test length when I changed the 0 to a -1 then BOOM! passed. Unless I am totally missing something it seems like might indicate that the the row lengths are != to each other in this test case... if so is that intentional or is that a bug?, Resolved,1
Thursday September 26th 2013 10:24 am -04:00,No it worked fine when I tested with the above and changed my len to 0 (or 1 for that matter)... Im starting to wonder if (I was sleepy when I submitted it) the test case for this test has a single row and if so if Id started with index 1 rather than 0 itd be trying to read columns the len of the string.. which if the string were longer than the column would cause a fail.I might resubmit with and index value of 0 and 1 to see if thats the case... so like if the board for this test case was like:[P I E] and the test word was PIES it should spit an error... if I had a 1 and not a 0....but thatd be a pretty silly test case..., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 11:38 am -04:00,This is a possible bug thread with the autograder... I dont have access to the board the autograder uses and as far as I am aware none of us does. There might be  a problem with a board used for this test which is the reason this thread is here. If this were a local machine issue Id check my board before even looking at my code. , Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 11:55 am -04:00,I have a 37/37 now that I replaced the range(len(board[0])) with range(len(board[-1]))... Ive tested it with every test that I can think of myself and with every test suggested by anyone on this thread or the other thread I have on it. The only way that Ive been able to replicate it at home is by having a non-rectangular board. (Such that the row in the first sublist is longer then a following sublist row)The only other thing I can think of is that if I had typoed a 1 rather than a 0 so that my board was [1] and the test case is testing for a 1 row board.... len(sublist[1]) would then be checking the length of the word. However the word would have to be longer in that case then the row... and Id be confused as to why they would include a case like that. The fact that people have used [0] and not had the 36/37 result makes me think however that it might have been the case that I used a [1]... Im thinking of checking that tonight I have plenty of time to check before the final submission deadline., Resolved,0
