Monday August 19th 2013 1:20 pm -04:00,I dont understand why the first answer in the quiz was correct syntax. It appears as if there is an extra parenthesis at the end.Also I was not given the correct answer after my third attempt to answer the question. What was the correct answer?ThanksMary, Resolved,1
