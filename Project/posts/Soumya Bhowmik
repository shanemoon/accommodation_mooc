Wednesday September 4th 2013 2:23 am -04:00,The key-combinations work fine. But is there any way to make the features permanent as long as I use idle?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 4:23 am -04:00,The auto completion feature is permanent. But Show call tip and Show Completion works only once.I am using the idle in Windows 7.Thanks, Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 4th 2013 7:06 am -04:00,It is not the case. If I press ctrl+backlash the tool-tip is visible. But only once. Next time it doesnt appear. And ctrl-5 is not an option.auto completion and show completion is different. show completion is enabled with ctrl+space. But works only once.Bye, Unresolved,0
