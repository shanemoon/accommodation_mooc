Monday September 23rd 2013 10:50 pm -04:00,Hi JamesIve just submitted and had the same error. I think it was because I had the game running in the background when I chose to upload the file. Ill try to submit again (in 50ish minutes) and let you know how it goes.RegardsAmish, Resolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 11:47 pm -04:00,I wish I read Toms response before submitting again. I did have the import in there and it failed again., Resolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 11:56 pm -04:00,It was for convenience when testing. It allowed me to avoid typing the import in the main python shell whenever I reloaded a3. Wasnt there a post earlier from the course professors about allowing to submit more frequently?, Resolved,0
