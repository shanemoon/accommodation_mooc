Saturday August 24th 2013 11:09 pm -04:00,I tried this one>>> import builtins>>> dir(builtins)it was good and another way to learn but I think if you type>>> dir(__builtins__)is much easier Because its one line while you going to have the same result!!, Resolved,1

Saturday August 24th 2013 11:21 pm -04:00,Thank you I think I got what you mean. may be because the last point I didnt catch it.but why when I use the Capital letters it says Error ??Also when I type this equation AREA = base * height / 2 didnt say anything. Whereas I type the same equation but I used this time the uppercase letter after the ( = ) it says Error ??this confuse me @_@!, Unresolved,0

Wednesday August 28th 2013 1:07 am -04:00,what I understand the different between print and return is- print gives direct order and wont gives you the result when you ask for it !- return not till you ask for it. as many as you ask about itin the 1st quiz on the 3rd part make me confuse @_@!how can I get same steps as its shown ??when I try to type return num1 + num2 then type print it says SyntaxError but when I jump to the next line then type print( ... ) it gives me the result directly. Also when I continue to type the result = sum(2 4) it gives me nothing as I mention above return you have to ask for it so when I ask for it it gives me the result. But the Answer is out of that either hello or Nothing ?, Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 8:29 am -04:00,how can I get same steps as its shown ??def sum(num1 num2):    return numb1 + num2    print(hello)result = sum(1 3), Resolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 9:11 pm -04:00,why would you say  (int) -> bool not  (str) -> (int) ?and how about if I would like to change the Return to Print how its going to be ??, Unresolved,0
