Wednesday September 11th 2013 12:31 am -04:00,wow O_O... hey I think you guys are actually just overthinking this... the entire assignment only took me 45 minutes.. lets be honest guys its INCREDIBLY easy... SO easy that once you actually get the solution youll ask yourself.. why didnt I see this earlier? but really it ALWAYS looks easier AFTER its been done. This one no different., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 12:34 am -04:00,my point is dont THINK its difficult.. think its easy... everything fairly straightforward.. and one line answers to almost each step... hang in there... oh.. and one more thing if it doesnt work once.. it wont work another MILLION TIMES... change perspective... out of frustration people TEND to try the same tactic over and over again. If you find yourself doing this it means you need a break. and when taking a break.. TAKE A BREAK! dont think about the problem or it defeats the purpose^_^.. see?, Resolved,0
