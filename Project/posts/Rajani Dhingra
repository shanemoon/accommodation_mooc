Thursday August 29th 2013 11:37 pm -04:00,What can we do to recall the old commands? Ctrl+P as the instructor says does not work for me. I am a windows 7 user and my IDLE window too does not like the instructors window :-| It does work though. I do not see a RUN command too. Can someone help. All help will be appreciated. I am attaching a screenshot of my IDLE prompt., Resolved,0
