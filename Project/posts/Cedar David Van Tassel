Monday September 9th 2013 11:16 pm -04:00,By not clear I mean Im not sure what my score was. When I submitted after step one it went smoothly and i got 5/41. Now when I enter my file it says I have 0/41. I didnt change the first step so even if everything else on my submitted file were wrong Im still getting messed up results. Being so close to the deadline Im a bit worried about this. Any suggestions?, Unresolved,1
