Monday August 19th 2013 11:30 am -04:00,Im using my Raspberry Pi running Raspbian wheezy. As I want to learn to operate terminal and bash as well Ive decided not to use IDLE which runs as a GUI. Instead I operate on terminal level only. Ive noticed its much faster than the GUI.  I just type sudo python  and am in! ,None,0

Monday August 19th 2013 1:04 pm -04:00,I got myself a Pi (Ive got two already) to teach myself Linux and coding. Ive got a laptop running Windows but didnt want to mess up with it as its used by one more person in my house. Thus Pi is perfect for me. If I break anything I can start again without having to hear about lost data. Im lightyears behind but I hope to catch up and learn the Vi as well thanks to Pi. ,None,0
