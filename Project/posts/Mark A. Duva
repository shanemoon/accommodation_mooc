Saturday September 21st 2013 11:37 am -04:00,What should I do if I know I am not going to pass.  I understand the stuff ok I just dont have the time anymore and I am behind by about 2 weeks..  I am starting a new job and two other courses.  Can I still un-enroll?  I have not take any courses from this site.  What happens if you dont pass?  Does that get recorded like regular transcripts that is to say does the site keep  records such that if I want to show an employer that I took one course and passed do they also see that I took another and did not pass?Is there even anything like transcripts that can be obtained by the student and if so would they show all the passes and NO PASSES?Help please!,None,1
