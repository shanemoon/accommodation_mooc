Tuesday September 24th 2013 3:01 am -04:00,print(...)    print(value ... sep=  end= file=sys.stdout)        Prints the values to a stream or to sys.stdout by default.    Optional keyword arguments:    file: a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.    sep:  string inserted between values default a space.    end:  string appended after the last value default a newline.It seems end add a newline. But it doesnt match an expirement. Do I got the wrong way?, Resolved,0
