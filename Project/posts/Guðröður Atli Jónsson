Monday September 2nd 2013 6:41 am -04:00,I feel you man :) I am going now for 5/5 to get 18/18 my 4 attempt 17/18 question 14 :s, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 6:14 pm -04:00,this is so frustrating :( I read through all forum on question 14.  And I still do not get it.  My latest try was like thisreturn count_letters(count_vowels(hello) + count_consonants(bonjour))before that:return count_letters(count_vowels(word) + count_consonants(word))I get that this is about reusing function like was shown in the video lectures with the semiperimeter, Resolved,1

Sunday September 1st 2013 6:26 pm -04:00,of course I see it now  I do not call the function that I am making :), Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 10:39 am -04:00,I did it like this but I get a error on the Autotesting.  I fail 3 test on this functions so I was doing something wrongdef get_complement(nucleotide):         (str) -> str    The first parameter is a nucleotide (A T C or G).        Return the nucleotides complement.    >>> get_complement(ACGTACG)        TGCATGC        >>> get_complement(CGGGTACGAAT)        GCCCATGCTTA                cstr =     for char in nucleotide:                if char == (A):                        char = T                elif char == T:                        char = A                            if char == C:                        char = G                elif char == G:                        char = C                                cstr = cstr + char            return cstr, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 10:56 am -04:00,so my functions work but the examples are worng?the message form autotesterro 1Method Description:Have you tested your function on a zero-length sequence?Message:ERROR: AttributeErrorReplacerModule object has no attribute get_complementary_sequenceerro 2Method Description:Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?Message:ERROR: AttributeErrorReplacerModule object has no attribute get_complementary_sequenceerro 3Method Description:Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences        of each nucleotide?Message:ERROR: AttributeErrorReplacerModule object has no attribute get_complementary_sequence, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 4:08 pm -04:00,I just pass it 24/24 :) well yes I just had not write it jet so that is way I was getting a erro.   I just reuse the get_complement(nucleotide) so this tow are the same get_complement(nucleotide) == get_complementary_sequence, Unresolved,0
