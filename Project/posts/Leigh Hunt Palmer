Monday August 26th 2013 8:42 pm -04:00,Please comment on my answer to this question in the video:The correct answer seems to be TypeError according to the video.I entered the code into IDLE correctly I think and got:>>> def sum(number1 number2):	return number1 + number2>>> result = sum(1 3)>>> new_result = result + 1>>> new_result5>>> I did not get a TypeError. Why not? What am I missing?, Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 9:04 pm -04:00,Yes it is the result I expected too. The answer in the lecture says that the outcome (after the penultimate command) should be TypeError. It was not. Why not?, Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 10:16 pm -04:00,Ettienne I see no print call. The code I pasted in is exactly what was in the video., Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 11:12 pm -04:00,I went back and checked the lecture. You are correct; there is a call to print - now but there was not a call to print when I originally looked at the question. The question as I posted it is a graphic screen dump not transcribed code. (Note the Coursera bullet points above.) I am annoyed but thanks to all for answering me. If anyone figures out how it happened I would like to know. It did cost me an unproductive hour or so. Otherwise this thread is resolved., Resolved,0

I have been using computers for physics since 1956 but not much since I retired in the last century. I find coding hangups are usually best solved by sleeping on them. The solutions are benevolent bedbugs and when one bites you you must get up and write it down. No dont go correct it and recompile etc. GO BACK TO SLEEP after writing it down.There are worse bumps in lifes road than seemingly insoluble programming problems. I once worked two years on an experimental problem that a friend and colleague (a theoretician) solved in less than two minutes. It turned out I was working on a problem with a trivial solution. Still life is good and my much cleverer fiend who died five years ago with a knighthood has my eternal gratitude for freeing me from my trap.Though this was an almost negligible bump in my road back to learning formal programming I do sincerely appreciate your help in putting it behind me., Resolved,1
