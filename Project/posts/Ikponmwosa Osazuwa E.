Sunday September 29th 2013 1:27 pm -04:00,Thats not really difficult this is what you should do  the in means if something is among a list of somethingthere is no need to write anything more(or let me make it more clearer the answer you want is True if an element is in a list or string of elements and False if it is not there so only operator you need for that is the in operator it is actually called relational operator while the less than (><== )etc are called comparison operator.I hope this help, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 1:38 pm -04:00,you made a very tricky mistake there this is it ...when you loop for the first time i.e the first line of the loopyou should start from index 0 of the board something like this range(len(board[0]))2) your second line is cool3) your third line is cool4) you should tell python to move out of the for loop using else (instead of just writing return False) Note: when you tell python to move out of the loop your with the else statement you should not put it in the same column as the if statement. Hope this help cause think we are not allowed to say more than what i have written and i think the art of programming is about learning from other peoples code i.e reading and writing (practicing) codes ...........Thanks!, Resolved,0
