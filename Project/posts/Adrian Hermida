Sunday September 1st 2013 3:57 pm -04:00,The black screen comming up is a cmd shell trying to execute your code. As Mason and Chandana already said if you want to open the file in order to view its content simply right click in it and choose the Edit with IDLE option in the context menu.You can also go to IDLE and use the menus there: File > Open to browse and choose your file. Hope this helps!, Resolved,0
