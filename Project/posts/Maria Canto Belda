Sunday August 25th 2013 11:36 am -04:00,Hello Savez ShabkhezI have the same problem that you have experience and I agree with you seems that this exercise number one is not working properly because as you suggested there are only to correct answers but when you get the mark every answer appears checked as wrong..., Resolved,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 11:40 am -04:00,Well in my case is exercise number one in yours number 10 but I know you are referring to the same exercise because I know for sure that my answers are correct..., Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 3:13 am -04:00,I repeat: there is no misunderstanding here.One of the exercises is not working properly because it is imposible that all the answers are incorrect dont you think?. Moreover I have tested all the answers on Python and twio of the answers that the exercise crosses as incorrect are correct. Anyway I dont see the point of explaining this to you the best thing to do is send an email to someone explaining the unexpected behaviour., Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 3:31 am -04:00,You are right. I am so sorry it was indeed a misunderstanding I confused without and with so the answers I was providing were just the opposite to the expected answers. So totally my mistake I read the question again and again and didnt see what I was doing wrong. So thank you for you help and I am sorry for the inconvenience..., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 2:19 pm -04:00,HelloI was doing exercise 2 of the assignment 1 and everything goes perfect if I use parenthesis but if I use the Arithmetic Operators order the result is incorrect. Has the division priority to the multiplication?My example would be: value2 - value1 / value * value . It seems that only takes the subtraction.Thank you for your help, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 4:52 pm -04:00,Thank you very much for your answer I have it perfectly clear now. I thought that multiplication had preference to division... , Resolved,0
