The expressions that make up the actual parameters are evaluated#            and the formal parameters of the function are bound to the resulting values.#            for example the invocation sqrt(16) will bind the formal parameter x to 16.##      2. The point of execution (the next instruction to be executed) moves from the#            the point of invocation to the first statement in the body of the function.##      3. The code in the body of the function is executed until either a return statement#            is encountered in which case the value of the expression following the return#            becomes the value of the function invocation. If no expression follows the return#            then the value of invocation is None.##      4. The value of the invocation is the returned value.##      5. The point of execution is transferred back to the code immedietly following the invocation.#From the book introduction computation and programming using python by professor John Guttag from MIT., Resolved,2

Wednesday September 4th 2013 1:09 pm -04:00,basically indentation will kick your ass  in your first days in python :). As I understand it indentation is the spaces before some parts of the code.  For example this space is only required after defining a function. Sodef  get_hours(x):    return bla bla blaIt also occurs after other things like the if conditional  while and for loop. To the best of my knowledge whenever you have to use a colon the next line after that is indented.One more point. The standard indentation is four spaces. Or you can simple click Enter and it will do the indentation for you.Hope that helps :), Unresolved,1

The lectures were clearly rushed in my opinion.Heres my best advice on learning writing and reading files (and python in general)use www.Codeacademy.com  alongside this course. It will help tremendously. , Unresolved,2
