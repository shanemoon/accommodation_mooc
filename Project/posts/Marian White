Monday September 2nd 2013 9:12 am -04:00,Im not having a chip about the material - having hacked my way through python for Coding the Matrix its great to actually understand what is really happening! - but its obvious from this and other threads that (for example) questions 14 & 15 are not only proving harder than I would have expected but its also difficult to provide pointers without just giving the answer.  Also I cant think of a way of testing them manually without either using functionality we havent been taught yet or using some sort of hard coded function definitions that could be even more confusing. How would you do it?, Unresolved,0
