Saturday September 21st 2013 7:13 pm -04:00,Hello STAFF I realized that the Autotesting tool does not take into account the use of the is_valid_sequence function inside the get_complementary_sequence function. I think it should do it :) Best regards, Unresolved,-1
Saturday September 21st 2013 9:36 pm -04:00,Yes thats what I mean. First I submitted the assignment with the get_complementary_sequence function w/o checking if the DNA sequence is valid and I got all the points. Then I added the call function of is_valid_sequence function inside get_complementary_sequence submitted again and got all the points. Now my get_complementary_sequence function prints a message if the DNA sequence is not valid. I think this case should be taken into account when grading (the second approach is better) Just a minor remark :), Unresolved,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 9:46 am -04:00,Remember that in the problem domain section we were told that neuclotides are only uppercase letters ATG and C :) In your examples only the second test should return True., Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 8:59 am -04:00,In the two last functions you have to assume that the file has been opened before the call of that functions. This means that when you test them in IDLE you should open a file and pass the reference as the argument to the functions. Finally when you test the driver you dont have to open anything because the driver will do it for you after you choose the files., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 9:11 am -04:00,Actually the last line in the Traceback says that. The driver has already opened the file wordlist1.txt for you and has assigned a reference to that file in the variable words_file. When the program calls your read_words function the argument is that reference (<_io.TextIOWrapper name=D:/Python33/wordlist1.txt mode=r encoding=cp1250>) but your function is trying to reopen that which is impossible., Unresolved,0

Thursday September 26th 2013 10:15 pm -04:00,Actually you are on the right track. Remember that the board (in your example y) is a list and each element is also a list of letters. The for loop is going to iterate over the board at certain index (a certain list of letters). So the x will refer to a letter you can append in new_variable., Resolved,2
