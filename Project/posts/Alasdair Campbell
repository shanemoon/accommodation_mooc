Tuesday September 3rd 2013 2:48 pm -04:00,As a general rule my understanding was that a principal in programming is to have only one exit point from a function. In the video 4 - 5 - If statements the examples have many return points. While the code is more brief this can lead to more problems when the complexity increases., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:56 pm -04:00,Yes I did mean more than I return statement which creates multiple exit points from a function. Some programmers would consider this to be analgous with a GOTO statement in C., Resolved,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 6:04 pm -04:00,We all need to learn to crawl before we walk before we learn to run. The str methods may provide a quicker or simpler solution because of the way python works; however this course in learning the fundamentals for programming in most languages. By not using str the solutions are teaching basic concepts of loop and condition testing which are building blocks to creating more complex applications. , Unresolved,6

Tuesday September 24th 2013 3:05 pm -04:00,Think about it this wayWhen you loop through the BOARD variable it gives you the entire row. So when you have the row of data from BOARD could can use the COLUMN to to find the character you want to add to a the result for., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 5:39 pm -04:00,Yes this is an undocumented system feature I think aka a bug. Here is one solution to it......    while player.strip() or not players:        player = player.strip()        good_data = True        for a in range(len(players)):            if (players[a][0]) == player:                print(A player by that name is already playing.)                good_data = False        if player and good_data:            players.append([player 0])        if players and good_data:            print(Leave a blank player name to begin playing.)        player = input(Enter player {num} name: .format(num=len(players) + 1))...There are probably over options to do this but this works., Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 24th 2013 8:34 pm -04:00,This is not enough. It will then add the duplicate entry. Once the error condition is flagged processing should stop on the data entered. the statement  if [player0] in players: is equivalent to the statement which I provided in the fix. Maybe is it more elegant and shorter but as long as it works., Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 24th 2013 9:37 pm -04:00,As I said this I proposed only one solution . The proposal from Tom did not include  the else if option. My download of a3_driver did not have a elif. Maybe someone changed the download., Unresolved,0
