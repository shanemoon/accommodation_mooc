Monday September 30th 2013 7:04 am -04:00,HiI uploaded my assignment after writing the first function and got 5/37. I wrote the next two and uploaded them but got a score of 0 despite not changing the first function. The feedback I get is an error for every function. Can anybody help?Thanks, Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 7:07 am -04:00,I suppose to be clear what Im wondering is - is it natural for an error in one part to knock all functions into error? I thought they were scored independently of each other, Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 7:28 am -04:00,Whats a structural error? Im actually on a computer where I cant access the python compiler so Im editing in wordpad. Ive done this for the early functions in the previous two assignments with no problems, Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 7:51 am -04:00,No Ive none of the software on this machine. It seems actually to have been a problem with the tabs copying the spacing from the source code seems to have sorted the issue. Thanks for your help Rasmus, Resolved,0
