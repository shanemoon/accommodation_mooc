Tuesday September 3rd 2013 12:34 am -04:00,I just want to say I think this class is great. Ive taken other MOOCs on programming and Python and I didnt finish them. I got really frustrated; I felt they werent explaining things in a coherent and thorough way. I love the way you guys are explaining this stuff. It goes into way more detail detail that Im sure is going to be be instrumental in nailing down the harder stuff later. Thanks! Yer doin it right!,None,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 10:10 pm -04:00,I cant get my head around why the list items move left and not right.Say were on iteration 4 (in other words i = 1). Then:L[i-1] = L[i] meansL[3] = L[4]To mean that should mean that whatever is list item 3 now becomes list item 4.What am I not understanding here? Thanks!!!, Resolved,1
Monday September 23rd 2013 10:22 pm -04:00,okay some specific wording in the video helped. The item at index 3 gets the value of the item at index 4.its still not very solid for me though why the assignment goes one way and not the other. I guess its the same when you assign a value to a variable though. You say x = 5 not 5 = x; and x takes the value of 5 5 doesnt take the value of x.so i guess i answered my own question. , Resolved,1
