So when you call the function you use the playlist name as the first parameter and the song name as the second parameter. If you call your list song_list and one of the songs is songA then the function call is cap_song_repetition(song_list songA). Then the code should change the list to have a maximum of three instances of songA. , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 5:53 pm -04:00,What I did was first define the function in a new window and run the module. Then define the list in the shell and then use the list name in the function. So:>>> song_list = [ Lola Venus etc.]Then call the function using the name:>>>cap_song_repetition(song_list Lola)Im not sure where they showed this; I think alot of it was just implicit in the examples., Resolved,0

Sunday September 22nd 2013 9:58 pm -04:00,Remember that square brackets indicate a list so you cant mix them with parentheses.Cap_song_repetition is a function not a variable or list. The function uses the list and the song as its parameters. So it takes the playlist and the song and alters the list according to the while loop. The idea is to try one at a time and see which works. As for errors you cant print something before you define what it is.  You will get errors for the ones that are wrong so you should expect some errors.  What exactly are you putting into IDLE? Im not good enough at this to analyze whats going on with your code but I would review the posts above and run the code in the visualizer so you can see what is happening. Hope this helps., Resolved,1
