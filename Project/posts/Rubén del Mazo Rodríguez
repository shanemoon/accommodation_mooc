Thursday September 5th 2013 11:30 am -04:00,Im not sure I understand. The explanation that appears when you work out it is: Remember that the print function only prints a value onto the screen. A function that does not have a return statement returns None. Is it related with the fact that using print in a function you cant reuse the value that is given when you call the function? I mean what is displayed in the video that you cant do: new_result = result + 1, Unresolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 11:01 am -04:00,I was thinking about that question. You have to choose either the first or the second one answer. In my view that means the one which is pointed as incorrect by the program  is completely wrong and unusable; thats the goal of the quizs providingboth wrong and correct examples so that we learn.But(math_grade >= 50 or math_grade >= 80) and (bio_grade >= 50 or bio_grade >= 80) and (cs_grade >= 50 or cs_grade >=  80)  it isnt completely wrong. Assuming all of our values are >50 theres only 1 possibility out of 4 that the function is wrong. Thus we may say it isnt suitable for all the cases.Perhaps/Surely Im creating an unnecessary mess but I only wanted to write it down and someone to answer me., Unresolved,0
