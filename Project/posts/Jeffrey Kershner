Tuesday August 27th 2013 3:56 pm -04:00,Hi Ozge Utanwhen you type something into IDLE it should automatically line up the space for you.for example:def square_print(num):after you use the enter/return key it will put the cursor on the line underneath at the right spacing.  as long as you dont use Backspace or some other way of moving the cursor left you will be lined up.Once you are done with that section of code (done with that thought/process/bit of logic) you need to go back to the left.  below is a visual way thinking about it.  the A B C lines are together since they are lined up   A  A        B        B               C               C  , Unresolved,0

I just made the changes to the seconds part saved it then submitted the whole thing.  I failed the uncompleted parts but when resubmitted that was overwritten., Unresolved,0
