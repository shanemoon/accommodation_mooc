Tuesday September 24th 2013 8:36 am -04:00,Since we are actually looking for an element match imo its necessary for us to modify the code...Please correct me if Im wrong. My code:def count_matches(s1 s2):     (str str) -> int    Return the number of positions in s1 that contain the same character at the    corresponding position of s2.  Precondition: len(s1) == len(s2)     num_matches = 0    for i in range(len(s1)):        for j in range(len(s2)):            if s1[i] == s2[j]:                num_matches = num_matches + 1                    return num_matchesprint(count_matches([1 2 3 4 5 6] [5 2 3 7 4]))>>> 4, Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 3:28 am -04:00,Thanks for the reply George. I intentionally changed the code so that it returns the number of matching elements in both the lists regardless of their position. I do understand the point youre trying to make though. My code would definitely be wrong if I was trying to achieve what you mentioned above. Perhaps I misunderstood the last in-line quiz question. , Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 12:24 pm -04:00,Thanks for the post Srinivasan. I was facing the same problem but fortunately Toms tip did the trick for me. Is Python installed on C drive on your machine or is it installed on any other drive? Im not sure but Im wondering if that could be the cause of the error. Also I used a .txt file not  a .doc file. , Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 12:58 pm -04:00,The last inline quiz question has a variable set as :cat_file = open(cat.txt r)I noticed with other files that we dont really need to add the quotation marks. It actually gives me error if I add the quotes to the filename. >>> flanders_file = open(flanders_filename r)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#25> line 1 in <module>    flanders_file = open(flanders_filename r)FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: flanders_filenameJust an observation I thought I could share..., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 3:58 am -04:00,My understanding about files is still a little fuzzy. Can anyone please point me to an easy-to-understand resource where I can read more about the files concepts in python  , Unresolved,1

Saturday September 28th 2013 8:02 pm -04:00,After getting stuck at 33/37 Wasnt able to solve the last part yesterday after 5 frustrating hours.  Woke up sometime ago and was pondering over life & stuff when it suddenly struck me...I think I was able to put the last piece of puzzle in its place. I was using a test file to experiment my code. so heres my final output:[[E F J A J C O W S S] [S D G K S R F D F F] [A S R J D U S K L K] [H E A N D N D J W A] [A N S D N C N E O P] [P M S N F H H E J E] [J E P Q L Y N X D L]]I was quite happy with myself until I implemented the functionality in the main code. The auto-test has sadly failed. Can anyone please tell me what is wrong with the above output?, Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 8:35 pm -04:00,No Robert. Ive implemented the functionality using lists. So I was returning a list. Im not really sure how I would return the board here, Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 8:57 pm -04:00,Robert as defined in the first line of the docstring in a3 A board is a list of list of str. So technically using a list isnt correct. right?, Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 9:11 pm -04:00,ECSTASY!!! I finally did it 37/37...man it feels good :D I was actually pretty stupid enough to forget reading the lines in the actual code thats why my test file was working and my code wasntPhewww.....Thanks for the help Robert... Your advice to check the return value actually instigated me to recheck my function... :), Resolved,2
Friday October 4th 2013 2:48 am -04:00,Thank you so much Dr. Jen and Dr. Paul. This has been an amazing learning experience for me. I really enjoyed all the lessons and assignments especially the last assignment... that was real fun to work on. Like some of the others here I Just finished my exam and I really cant wait to join the follow-up course for this. Id also like to thank the amazing TAs of this course and my fellow peers for the making the discussions on the forums so lively. Ill be joining the Introduction to interactive programming in python which starts in 2 days... I hope to see some of you there Cheers! :), Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 12:14 pm -04:00,I apologize if this has already been asked I was unable to find a related thread. I was wondering if there were good projects that we could work from what we learned in this course something similar to the assignments that we work on every week...Something challenging yet not too complex. Any references would be great. If the forum remains open for posting we could collaborate on any queries issues to help each out. Just a thought...,None,0
Friday October 4th 2013 1:08 pm -04:00,Thanks for the post Judi... Ill definitely chk out the game you created... I had actually finished half of the exercises at codeacademy. codingbat does seem promising. Its really silly of me to have missed out the practice section on the course wikiAnd dont worry too much about the exam... Im sure youll do great :),None,0
Friday October 4th 2013 4:27 pm -04:00,Hi Judi I was fiddling with the game youve coded and I must say its brilliantly written. Nicely done :)I tried some stuff to improvise on the final part which calculates num_part but wasnt successful...(obviously) However I did a very minor tweak which might allow the player to choose the total number of digits the number actually comprises of. http://paste.debian.net/50547/For example: the player can opt for guessing a 4-digit 5-digit or 6-digit number. The choice is his/hers. Ill still looking into the code now and then and if I get something in my head Ill let you know...All in all..great job!,None,0
Friday October 4th 2013 1:14 pm -04:00,Che Im halfway in the exercises at codeacademy... Thanks for introducing me to Udacity though. I think its the building a search engine course. right?And yeah Ive enrolled myself in that course :) Same stuff here too Had to quit earlier after three assignments as I had other priorities last time. I hope to finish it too this time. Best of luck and see you there :),None,0
