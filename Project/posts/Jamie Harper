Saturday September 14th 2013 10:40 am -04:00,Just for discussion - I went with return not 12 <= temp <= 28 and got Incorrect! but it works I believe; just in case anyone elses brain works similarly to mine and they wanted to check if its correct! I believe it is correct (like some of the ones above it works in IDLE). In case this doesnt actually work and someone is kind enough to point that out thatd be cool too. I couldnt think how to use the or operator and make it work :( It would be cool if when you hit explanation it actually told you their intended solution [for that ohhhHHHHhhhh moment ;) ]., Resolved,0
