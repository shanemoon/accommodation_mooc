Thursday August 22nd 2013 8:25 am -04:00,For the 15 question I put in the code:def even {your line}    return {your line}even{your line}And I get SyntaxError: invalid syntax,None,0
Thursday August 22nd 2013 8:51 am -04:00,Sorry but you missed my question. I only used {your line} so as not to show to much of the quiz question. My question is why am I getting SyntaxError: invalid syntax when I put your lines into my Python 3.3.2 Shell?,None,0
Thursday August 22nd 2013 9:06 am -04:00,That is exactly what I did. And except for the curly braced stuff to replace your lines this was the result. But I will add this to make it clear. That the second line lined up with the first indented. The third line  started at the left margin.  If I bring the third line out to line up with the second the program just hangs. Also the first word of the first and second lines is pink but not the third line.,None,0

Thursday August 29th 2013 1:17 am -04:00,I have my Python 3.3.2 shell working fine. But I cant find IDLE with the overhead display like I see in the lectures. How do I  bring this up?, Unresolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 9:06 am -04:00,Thanks PaddyI have a Sony lap top Win7. I down loaded Python 3.3.2 and get a shell but no toolbar., Unresolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 9:26 am -04:00,Thanks I get a new window and can use both. But I still dont have a toolbar as in the video. I can survive with this but I thought that I was missing something., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 5:18 pm -04:00,In my opinion a different Assignment 1 should have been given after exercise 1. It should have been trivial to walk people through the grading program itself. And it would have allowed the numbers for lecture week assignment and exercise to match. The assignment would have had two questions; one that passed and one that failed. That way the technicalities of the grading program could have been dealt with without pressure., Pinned Resolved,14
