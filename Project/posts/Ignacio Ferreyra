Wednesday September 4th 2013 1:47 pm -04:00,Am I the only one who thinks that just writing:if precipitation:instead of :if precipitation == True:was a little bit confusing?I GUESS that the True statement is implied but I dont think this was explained in the lecture. Am I wrong?, Unresolved,3
Wednesday September 4th 2013 10:06 pm -04:00,Well my confusion came from the fact that precipitation is itself a variable and you could assign anything to it but certainly it makes sense that once you assign a bool to it the rest becomes redundant. And yes raining might be a clearer name! Thank you all!, Unresolved,1

Thursday September 12th 2013 1:48 am -04:00,Id just like to add I had the same problem and I also find it against logic that a zero lenght string is considered a valid DNA sequence. According to the problem domain a valid DNA sequence should be something composed of Ts As Cs and Gs. Thats what makes DNA valid not the lack of other components. This should be explained by the staff please., Resolved,3
Thursday September 12th 2013 2:36 am -04:00,In the quizz if it finds a vowel it changes to True. A zero length string would return False which makes perfect logic. This example shows how the DNA problem should be but is not. Is that what you mean?, Resolved,0
