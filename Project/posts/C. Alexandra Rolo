Monday August 19th 2013 6:59 pm -04:00,Hi Im Alexandra 23 years old and Portuguese.Red head grad Student currently in a Masters Degree of Cultural Management specializing in museology and working on a thesis related to social media (confusing much?). I have a masters in Religious History and a degree in modern and contemporary history.Â Im a blogger who loves to write draw and am a bit of a nerd (just a little huge bit). I live near Lisbon the city I love and where Ive studied since I went to university.This is my second coursera course but the previous one about literature I didnt finish since I thought that the evaluating system was a complete joke. This kind that we have here I actually like so I am going to finish this one before classes start again ^_^,None,0
