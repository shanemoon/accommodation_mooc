Saturday August 24th 2013 10:18 am -04:00,I noticed in the video that all of the variables created were treated as Objects and thus the variables were pointers.  In many languages primitive variables actually contain values and not memory addresses of object.  Is this different in Python?  Are all variables considered pointers to objects?, Resolved,0

Sunday August 25th 2013 10:36 am -04:00,Well my question was more on clarifying how variables are handled in memory.  In Java primitives defined in local scope are on the stack and those defined in objects would live on the heap.Thanks for the post, Resolved,0

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:25 pm -04:00,Great explanation Fernando!I tried to break each one down to make them as simple as possible.  For get_hours I wrote down the following on scratch paper:1. Parameter is seconds2. Must return an int (must use // and not /)3. Return number of hours after midnightNow I know there are 3600 seconds in one hour.  In order to figure out how many hours are in the parameter(variable) seconds and also make sure the result is not a float., Unresolved,0
