Friday August 23rd 2013 5:48 pm -04:00,I am quite confused here. I have got the first edition of the book practical programming but miss Jen Campbell says it is quite different from the second edition (python 2 vs 3) . So do I have to buy the second edition or are there any other free alternatives as good as the book mentioned in the course? Would appreciate your help!, Resolved,0
