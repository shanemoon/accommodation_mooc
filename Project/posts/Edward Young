Wednesday August 21st 2013 1:08 am -04:00,Please try not to make it to complicated for those whom are trying to follow along. We are just as new to this as the sun coming up each morning. I think I understand some of it due to RAM being the storage facility while in operation and the variable is required in order to have any value you. Thus the variable is stored in RAM thus receiving the value there or is the value assigned before it reaches RAM? OK so you can now confuse me more...thanks! , Resolved,0

Friday August 23rd 2013 9:53 pm -04:00,I guess I should of asked this from the beginning are we suppose to post something on each window? If so I have to understand more than what I do now so I wont seem so far out in left field. Yep I am getting some of this but it aint easy. Have to look at the videos at least 5 time just to understand. Funny thing is I got a degree in programming in 1977 but never got a chance to use it. It was COBAL and RPG2 Fortran and another IBMmer. We did key to cards then so this is really all new to me. But will do my best to keep up....thanks for listening., Unresolved,0
