Thursday August 29th 2013 3:59 pm -04:00,I had the same issue.  Could you point out that you need to hit enter twice when you write a function.  If you do not do that then you get all kinds of syntax error messages.  This is the second python class I am attempting on Coursera I wound up dropping the last one because the instructors kept forgetting to explain the little things and quirks to the language.  Also the python documentation is not very good explaining these kinds of things.You did that when you did the lecture but you did not mention that in Python you have to hit enter twice to define a function. This is an  EXTREMELY important point when teaching a new programming language.  I learned Visual Basic over 13 years ago and in that language you when write a function you also write a line of code to end the function.  I just have not done any programming in a while.,None,1
