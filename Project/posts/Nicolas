Thursday September 5th 2013 12:18 am -04:00,I wrote the following code regarding flight schedules task It executes (seemingly) without problem despite it containing nothing but if statements. What is the importance of elif arguments?def report_status(scheduled_time estimated_time):     (number number) -> str    Return the flight status (on time early delayed)    for a flight that was scheduled to arrive at    scheduled_timed but is now estimated to arrive    at estimated_time.    Pre-condition: 0.0 <= scheduled_time < 24 and    0.0 <= estimated_time < 24        >>> report_status(14.3 14.3)    on time    >>> report_status(12.5 11.5)    early    >>> report_status(9.0 9.5)    delayed        if scheduled_time == estimated_time:        return on time    if scheduled_time < estimated_time:        return delayed    if estimated_time < scheduled_time:        return early    , Resolved,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 12:38 am -04:00,Have I misunderstood what is being asked of us in step 6?Should this be an example of my function call?   >>> time_to_utc(-1.5 22.0)    23.30Or shoud it be this? >>> time_to_utc(-1 0.5)    1.30Should it be both?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:01 am -04:00,I understand your frustration however that feeling will not help you progress in your code. Why dont you try to go out for a walk?Writing the code should in no case take 24 hours so relax.If you are interested in progressing in this course maybe taking another open coursea course called Introduction to Mathematical Thinking might be helpful.Good luck., Resolved,4
