Wednesday August 28th 2013 7:49 pm -04:00,Going well so far. I took An Introduction to Interactive Programming with Python last fall so many details are familiar but I appreciate things that are new to me such as the design recipe and use of the docstring. Thought the assignment looked a little intimidating at first but it was actually quite straightforward once I got into it. I look forward to seeing what challenges are ahead.,None,1
Wednesday September 11th 2013 6:03 pm -04:00,Both the intro to exercise 4 and the feedback section for question 14 refer to tracing by hand. I dont recall hearing about this in the lectures and I wondered just how one goes about tracing the program on paper.I actually didnt have any problem with question 14 itself; it was easy to follow the logic of the code fragments and think about which one would give the desired results. But since the teachers indicate that this is an important skill I wondered am I missing something? Thanks., Resolved,1

Saturday September 28th 2013 12:30 pm -04:00,Hey stopping at this point is perfectly reasonable but it sounds like youre being pretty hard on yourself when you say you dont deserve the 30/37 because youve gotten a lot of help on the forums. I found myself really at sea with those last two functions. I had decided to submit one last time and I was literally sitting on the couch groaning I suck to my husband as I hit the button. Even though I had finally worked it out it didnt feel right because I too had to rely on the forums to get anywhere with them.He has worked in many software companies though and he said this is really the experience of professional developers. When they dont know how to make something work they google it and usually end up on a discussion board or the blog of someone whos already had to solve the problem. Its much the same as using these forums and it gets the job done. So buck up -- youre already a pro! :), Unresolved,1
Tuesday October 1st 2013 9:27 am -04:00,You might consider cross-posting this issue in the Coursera Website forum -- Coursera staff might be more likely to check there. I agree that an alert screen before you open a strictly-timed exam seems most reasonable., Resolved,1
Tuesday October 1st 2013 4:11 pm -04:00,The professors do recommend this and this is what they say: Redo the exercises. (This cant affect your grade because we take the highest mark out of all your attempts.) This suggests you should be fine., Resolved,2
