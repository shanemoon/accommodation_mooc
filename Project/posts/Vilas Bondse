Wednesday September 11th 2013 12:34 am -04:00,I have experienced the same for exercise 3 and 4. Second attempt can not be done mechanically so it takes time. If second attempt is  to be done only for incorrect  answers then it would have saved time., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 2:52 am -04:00,I think I have understood what is happening. While checking if  your cursor is on a different answer than you have marked and if you happen to touch it that a new ans gets marked and earlier mark goes off.This happens since there is no Edit button for making change after saving. Need to be careful., Unresolved,1
