Wednesday August 21st 2013 3:55 pm -04:00,Hey thereI just wanted to share that I am very happy with the introductory lectures of the week and in general with the planning and develop of the course. First week was easy but I am sure it will get harder!Also in the Spanish study group created in Facebook someone has shared this highly recommendable introductory course http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python I think is ideal to complement this course and get some more practice.Enjoy!,None,1
