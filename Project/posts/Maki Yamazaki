Thursday September 5th 2013 1:20 am -04:00,I am a bit confused as to why questions 14 15 & 16 are worth 1.00 point each whilst question 13 is worth only 0.25 * 4.I found that although 14-16 initially threw me off guard (a reminder to be careful with terminology when it comes to programming) with the correct knowledge its a simple case of simple observation & clicking scoring 3 points with one concept.Conversely I found that question 13 was not only difficult to understand (being dyslexic does not help one bit either) but each answer took a reasonable amount of time consideration and concentration.I know its almost certainly too late to do anything about this for the immediate class but I think that in future classes perhaps this can be addressed? Otherwise Im really enjoying the lectures and finding that the exercises & assignments are a good balance of testing memory & logic as well as between comprehensibility & complexity., Unresolved,1
Thursday September 5th 2013 1:35 am -04:00,My query is not with how the questions create their point scores but more in the way that the test assesses studentsÂ ie. why give students up to 3 points for 3 easy questions but only 1 point for a much more challenging question when clearly a more complex thinking is demanded of students to answer latter., Unresolved,0
