Tuesday August 20th 2013 1:01 am -04:00,If you check on the web one of the complaints about Python is it is very particular about the indents being consistent.  Note that using spaces and tabs can be interpreted by Python differently and produce errors like this one., Resolved,1
Tuesday August 20th 2013 1:03 am -04:00,I believe some of the confusion is because Python in Windows runs a bit different than on an Apple which is used in the video.  When I execute Idle a Python 3.3.2 Shell window appears.  The Run option is not available.  After creating a new window defining the functions saving the files then the Run option is available. When the Run option is executed a new window is opened where the functions are available - the functions can be called in this window with their arguments (e.g. area (20 12)  or perimeter(105 8).The professors need to explain the different windows which appear. (Im on a Windows machine)., Resolved,2
Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:33 pm -04:00,If you are using Python in the command line mode think of it as a simple calculator where you have to input all the values and equation every time you change values.If you want to use an equation multiple times you need to define a function and then call the function:>>> def area(base height):              return base * height / 2>>>Then call the function with arguments (values) and it will give you the correct answer:>>> area(15 20)150.0This was in one of the lectures., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 2:00 am -04:00,The question asks for legal Python names so just check the ones that are legal.Correct answers are of two types:   1.  Legal Python names which you place a checkmark by.   2.  Non-legal Python names which you do not place a checkmark by.After you submit the exercise for grading you will get green checkmarks for correct answers.  So if you didnt place a check by a non-legal Python name that is a correct answer and you will get a green checkmark.,None,3
Tuesday August 20th 2013 10:00 pm -04:00,Hi Robab:Ive completed several online classes.GOOD POINTS:I agree with Diane often people participate in the forums because they are looking for help or have a question and the instructors/TAs are not available but many other classmates are.  Consequently they get help far quicker than waiting on an instructor or TA.  Often other students can relate to not understanding a concept better than the instructors or TAs.Also the anonymous nature of the forums makes students feel more comfortable about asking questions - students are often embarrassed to ask questions in front of other students in a classroom.BAD POINTS:The anonymous nature can also result in very disrespectful and confrontational behavior in a few cases.  People will say awful things in a forum that they would never say face to face.I started in another programming course and a course on global warming where several forums were very confrontational - I chose not to continue because confrontational behavior is counter-productive to a learning environment.  Its o.k. to respectfully disagree but these forums were very confrontational and disrespectful.However for the most part people are friendly helpful and enjoy engaging each other!From a practical standpoint a mooc with 10000 students would not work without collaboration.  Its just too much work for a handful of instructors to take care of.,None,1

Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:38 pm -04:00,Ive taken several Coursera classes.  Usually only a few questions are changed between different attempts...so you have to pay attention and carefully read the questions with each attempt.Sometimes the changes are subtle ... so read carefully.,None,2

Thursday August 22nd 2013 12:11 am -04:00,Ive completed several Coursera courses and found that if you watch the videos do any practice exercises completed the quizzes and complete the projects that a textbook is not necessary.  Also the forums are a great place to get questions answered and learn from reading other peoples posts.If you want extra practice and explanation a friend recommended this free book which is easy to understand and useful.http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/You can download the free PDF book.There are also free online tutorials which are a good supplement.  Heres a link:http://www.learnpython.org/, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 2:42 am -04:00,Hi Harmony.Dont give up. Its easier than you think once you get started.   Ill help you get started with step two.All its asking is to calculate the difference between two numbers in this case the two input numbers.Lets call these number1 and number2:So the difference of the two numbers is:difference = number2 - number1Say number2 = 1200 and number1 is 1000 so difference is:difference = 1200 - 1000 which the answer is 200 so difference = 200.Our type for this is inputting two numbers and getting a number out:   (number number) -> numberThe line of Python code to accomplish this would be:    RETURN number2 - number1In the assignment the function says the inputs are time_1 and time_2 which are the same as number2 and number1 in my example above.So all you need  is to write a single line of code which RETURNs the difference of time_1 and time_2The examples given in the exercise are>>> seconds_difference(1800.0 3600.0)    1800.0    >>> seconds_difference(3600.0 1800.0)    -1800.0    >>> seconds_difference(1800.0 2160.0)    360.0    >>> seconds_difference(1800.0 1800.0)    0.0In the first example your code should RETURN the answer of 1800.0:    3600.0 - 1800.0 = 1800.0Hope this is enough of a boost to get you going., Resolved,7
Wednesday September 11th 2013 2:48 am -04:00,I completed the Rice course but it was a real struggle after week 4.  You will have more problems with that course than this one.Ive taken other classes on Coursera (for example Calculus) and the subject is better suited to MOOCs.I think learning programming in a MOOC is problematic because of the Honor Code.  The code wont let beginners post enough code to get help so beginning students get frustrated.  I certainly got frustrated in the Rice course.Just remember its free and you can take it as many times as you like.Ive learned things from this course that I did not learn in the Rice course so just keep trying., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 2:23 am -04:00,The first assignment had an auto-grader so you should be able to submit it after the deadline.I believe it will record your score for the assignment and then deduct points for however late it is.I believe that is the same for the exercises., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 12:57 am -04:00,I find Python can be confusing with the variables that are named on the fly.When you define a function you include a variable name such as thing1 for example:def some_function(thing1):If you then call the function within another function you should use the same name:def some_other_function(thing2):     for thing1 in thing2:          new_stuff = new_stuff + some_function(thing1), Unresolved,0

Thursday September 19th 2013 12:09 am -04:00,I was getting errors when using my int which was named loc.The mistake I made was putting commas instead of colons in the indexing:for example:   dna[0 loc] was giving me an error message.   dna[0:loc] worked fine.And the code is very simple - I used only two lines.  Seen other posts where they did it with one line - I tried to do it in one line but got an error message., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 12:49 am -04:00,Glad you found your mistake.As a beginning programmer Ive found that simple mistakes often consume hours of trying to figure out what is wrong given the typical non-helpful nature of error messages. Better to quickly resolve them and get on with productive learning., Unresolved,0

Friday September 20th 2013 3:26 am -04:00,The video was a bit confusing mostly because on Windows the screens are a bit different and dont highlight the same as the Apple versions used by the instructors.Once I understood the program I asked the question - how about examples of using it to debug?As an example in one thread students were having a problem because the program was not looping through all of the characters only stopping at the first return statement.  How would the debugger help you identify this?, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 21st 2013 12:08 am -04:00,Square brackets are used to denote LISTS which can be changed by the program - i.e. - change out one element in a list with another.   G = [012345]Parentheses are used to denote TUPLES which are lists which cannot be changed by the program.   G=(012345)Its confusing because parentheses are also used to denote variables or input parameters.   range(1100)1. In your first example you are getting indexes because the code is asking to print the INDEX:     print(i)2. In the second example you are getting actual elements because you are asking it to print the ELEMENT in the list:     print(G[i]).        G[i] denotes an element in the list G at index i.3. In the third example the parentheses are used to denote the input parameters for the range function.Range is a built in Python function often used in for loops to create lists.  Its format is range(start stop step).  If step is not specified it defaults to 1.  If start is not specified it defaults to 0.Examples:>>>range(10)[0123456789]>>>range(110)[123456789], Resolved,1
Friday September 27th 2013 2:31 am -04:00,I had exactly the same error.  A fluke or is the test program adding extra characters?(Note:  Sometimes in Coursera  checked boxes get unchecked.  Found that in other Coursera classes too.), Resolved,0
