Monday September 9th 2013 11:14 am -04:00,First I wrote this - >>> eggs = 12>>> if eggs % 12 == 0:	return TrueSyntaxError: return outside functionThen I wrote this - >>> eggs = 12>>> def eggs_a(num):	if num % 12 == 0:		return True	else:		return False	>>> eggs_a(eggs)TrueI tried to write if statements without any functions but I get a syntax error as above and I cant even write the else statement as control jumps out after writing the return statement and gives me an error.Is it possible to write if-else statements without defining any functions or am I doing something wrong?, Resolved,0
