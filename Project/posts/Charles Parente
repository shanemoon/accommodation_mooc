Saturday August 31st 2013 3:53 am -04:00,Why is the answer to:print (ba + na * 2 + muffin)not a Type Error since  you can not multiply a string and an integer?Is it because the print function isnt performing a true calculation?ThanksCharles, Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 12:31 am -04:00,So what is the correct answer this quiz question?Ive read the explanations above but I dont see how [hours_asleep] variable relates to the [num_hours] parameter.How are we supposed to assume that they are the same thing?And since line 9 has not been executed yet [return not yet done] the function has not been processed yet.When I try to use the visualizer I cant get the code to run.  Still says Please wait.... and never finishes., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:48 pm -04:00,Yes the int problem.  Im 5 hours and counting on get-hours and can not figure this out.Im using the to_24_hour_clock function just fine and the result stays between 0 and 24 but the answer is float.So the code we are given for to_24_hour_clock() results in float but I cant figure out the math of converting float to int.For example in normal math:>>> 40/251.6>>> 40 // 251>>> 40 % 2515and I understand all three of those examples.But:>>> 28.5 % 244.5Thats float result which I can not convert to int by:>>> 4.5 // 4since the answer is 1.0 and not 1I cant figure out how to force an integer result...I tried building results statements tried the rounding function no luck.I need to move on to week 3 but if anyone can help me understand the math at work here i would appreciate it!-- Charles , Resolved,0

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 3:52 pm -04:00,I see some of the TAs who are inserting code in red text which is inline to the rest of their writing.How is this done???When I try clicking on the <code> button above it creates a new paragraph of code and does not have the red color.There should be a FAQ about how to use the forum tools--its not intuitive to me.For example how do I reply to a specific users comments on a long forum thread??I dont see a way to do that.thanksCharles, Unresolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 7:59 pm -04:00,So if else is not required why is:if temp == 22.5:    return Truenot a correct answer in the quiz??, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:23 pm -04:00,In this lecture out of nowhere the professor starts using the empty parenthesis ( ) without explaining it.        >>> white_rabbit = Im late! Im late! For a very important date!    >>> white_rabbit.lower()    >>> im late! im late! for a very important date!    >>> white_rabbit    >>> Im late! Im late! For a very important date!    --    What is the empty parenthesis accomplishing and why is it needed??, Unresolved,2
Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:49 pm -04:00,Hmm. Ok.I didnt realize that an empty function could be called without an error resulting.Thanks for the reply!, Unresolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 8:49 pm -04:00,Yes please!  Let us see detailed worked out answers after the deadline for submission credit has passed.This would be very helpful. Even better if it contained commentary about why the resulting code is correct., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 2:03 pm -04:00,The grader wants us to test insert_sequence at the beginning of dna1.Is this the same thing as in front of or before dna1?slicing/indexing will still retain the first character...>>>s=ATCG>>>s[0]ATheres no way to slice/index before ATCG.so for the given parameters we are supposed to use(dna1 dna2 int)how are we supposed to represent the before position with an intwhen int 0 would still include the first character of the string?I know about concatenation and creating substrings but I cant even write the test calls in my function recipe for the examples of at beginning or at end because I dont know how to represent the required int argument in those circumstances.Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!, Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 2:43 pm -04:00,Thanks for the tips!OK I see that but how can this be represented by a single int for writing a test function?We need to use the int argument in every function call and these beginning and end slices are not represented by a single int the way a normal slice is.in other words insert_sequence(CCGG AT ?)how can a single int represent the question mark above for the instances of before or afterwhen one needs these expressions to represent before or after?, Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 3:51 pm -04:00,Thanks everyone for the tips!I was able to find a partial answer and will re-investigate the rest later if time permits., Resolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 1:06 am -04:00,Im also very confused with regards to how this while statement is being executed.Heres a screenshot from the visualizer and a link below that to the actual visualization. http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=def+increment_items(L+increment)%3A%0A++++i+%3D+0%0A++++...---What I dont understand:1) L was never defined. How do we know what it is?2) according to the visualizer L points to the same object that values points to. Why?3) I thought that print statements only sent information to the screen and are not actually run.But on step 3 of the visualizer that print statement seemed to assign values to L and increment.I didnt know print statements could do that..., Unresolved,0

Friday September 20th 2013 11:16 pm -04:00,This example shows that range only indicates the index and not the actual list item:>>> G = [3 4 5 6 7]>>> for i in range(0 len(G) 2):	print(i)024But if the code is written this way we get the actual list elements>>> G = [3 4 5 6 7]>>> for i in range(0 len(G) 2):	print(G[i])	357but on page 158 of the textbook this example of range is giventhe i is naked yet i is clearly working with the actual valuesand is not simply presenting an index position.>>> total = 0>>> for i in range(1 101): ... total = total + i ...>>> total5050Why is this?Im not understanding why sometimes the i is simply in parenthesesand other times it needs to be surrounded by bracketsand preceded by a list name or some other variable??Thanks! , Resolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 11:06 pm -04:00,Tom:Thanks for the detailed explanation! Your posts have been a great learning resource for this class!But in the final step:L[-1] = first_itemIn the python viewer L[0] gets changed from a to b in step 8yet when line 15 finally executes it gets converted back to a which was initially set by the first_item = L[0] line.Why does first_item not change when the value of L[0] changes?When L[-1] looks for what first_item refers to why is it returning the old value of L[0] and not returning the current value of L[0]?, Resolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 5:05 am -04:00,What a great informative post by Tom!!! What amazing contributions he gives us on an almost daily basis!I understand the theory behind the for loop the accumulator and the empty string variable and all of the steps but I keep getting a TypeError:TypeError: can only concatenate list (not str) to listI cant figure out how to convert my list elements [A N T T] into a concatenation of strings ANTT.Ive been over the videos and exercises a hundred times now and cant figure out where to go from here.Thanks!- Charles , Unresolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 3:05 pm -04:00,Thanks Tom!I found my error--my variable was an empty list instead of an empty string--once I changed it to an empty string thingswent much more smoothly., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 6:07 pm -04:00,The feedback to question 12 says to trace each option in the visualizer.But I dont see a way to open a file in the visualizer to make the visualizer analyze/read a file.How is this accomplished?I tried using IDLE with a made-up text file to answer this question and that worked fine but my IDLE output was apparently wrong [although I didnt see any errors]., Unresolved,1
