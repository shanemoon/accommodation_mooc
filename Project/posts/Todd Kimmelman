Tuesday September 17th 2013 8:59 pm -04:00,I couldnt get the code in the PDF version (from the lecture notes) to work so I wrote this and got it to work:>>> def has_vowel(s):	(str) -> bool	Return True if and only if s has at least one vowel not including y.	>>> has_vowel(Anniversary)	True	>>> has_vowel(xyz)	False		vowel_found = False	for char in s:		if char in aeiouAEIOU:			return vowel_found == False		if char not in aeiouAEIOU:			return vowel_found == TrueI am so new to Python so any help clarification redundancies etc. I may have here would be greatly appreciated if pointed out in a way that I can understand.  :-)Thanks!, Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 3:58 am -04:00,Thanks Brian.  Im still a little fuzzy.  I tried running the code as given in the solution and got nothing:>>> def has_vowel(s):	(str) -> bool	Return True if and only if s has at least one vowel not including y.	>>> has_vowel(Anniversary)	True	>>> has_vowel(xyz)	False		vowel_found = False	for char in s:		if char in aeiouAEIOU:			vowel_found = True			>>> has_vowel(xyz)>>> I understand your explanation about the assumption of False (sometimes I miss the obvious stuff by overthinking).   Why is the word return not in this code?  :-\  I found that when I went back to the lecture there is a return statement aligned with the for command (as you helpfully noted) and I got it to make more sense (mostly).  So how can the solution as given be vowel_found = True without return vowel_found?, Unresolved,0
