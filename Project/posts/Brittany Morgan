Wednesday August 21st 2013 3:22 am -04:00,I have experience manipulating HTML/CSS codes on websites as well as some codes via graphic design in Photoshop but Ive never actually written my own codes before. So for me I can look at a lot of website codes and get the basic gist of what it says but I cant create my own and theres still a lot I dont understand. Plus it sounds better to say you have experience through a course than just messing around on the internet hehe. ,None,4
