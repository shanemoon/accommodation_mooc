Because this is not in the present simple tense (such as Returns the number of ...) then the other options are:1) the sentence use the imperative mode2) the sentence is a shorthand for a future tense (It will return the number of ..)English is not my native language and I am really curious about the tense used in that docstring.What do you think?Thanks!, Unresolved,1
