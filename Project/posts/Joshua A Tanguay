Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:56 pm -04:00,I had success with this and ignored the message regarding GCTAGCTA = TAGCTAGC.  My function handled it as such so it would return the compliment of the DNA sequence and my functions passed the automatic checking routine.  So GCTAGCTA = CGATCGAT., Resolved,0
