Tuesday August 20th 2013 10:58 am -04:00,Try How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. This is the original version. Instead of  using plain Idle they suggest using  PyScripter which I find to be a great ide for python but all coding can be done with Idle too. They also have a python 2 versionThere is another version by Runestone Interactive that is slightly different in some of the content order  and some of the problem sets. They also split the immediate level for stacks trees and other more advance programming into a separate section. Their site interactive and you can type the code directly in the web browser.I flip between the two. About 80% is the exact same in both but enough of a different to make both worth looking at. They use pythons built in turtle library which is different from most python 3 sites . Type help(turtle) in idle for info. Because How to Think Like a Computer Scientist is an open source book there are other versions but these are the two I have used., Resolved,1

Tuesday August 20th 2013 4:56 pm -04:00,I have both installed. One of things you should decide is which one is the default version. whichever you chose will be the one chose when you type python on the cmd line. But using the other is just as easy.I changed the path to include python 3 I made a copy of the python.exe then renamed it to python3.exe. Now when it type python3 in the cmd python 3 is thereEven though I use python 3 more than 2 I made 2 the default because the majority of the older code is written with it., Resolved,2
