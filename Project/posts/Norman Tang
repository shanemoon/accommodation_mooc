Monday August 26th 2013 12:08 pm -04:00,Why not release 2 to 3 weeks of video lectures and exercises?  Some of us could be busy in one week and not in another.  So it will be really helpful for us to watch the videos and complete the exercises in our free weeks.  This sort of allows some of us work at our own pace and yet the teaching team can still maintain a good control of the flow.Thx., Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 6:25 pm -04:00,I was confused by this quiz question as well.  However I believe the visualization asks that if this function is called and right after the execution of line 8 what is the value of the variable result.  Line 11 and line 12 are the givens if this function is called.  So after line 8 is executed Python would have assigned a value to the variable result and it is equal to num_hours * 60.  Before the return statement the variable result should take on the value of 300 given line 11 and 12 are executed.I guess the design of this question and the next is to teach us visualization of changes of values as the function is being executed., Resolved,3
Sunday September 1st 2013 12:56 pm -04:00,This quiz question should be answered this way:(1) Examine the function convert_to_minutes(num_hours) from Lines 1 to 8 only;(2) Given that hours_asleep is 5 and the function is called.  NOTE: Lines 11 & 12 have been executed.  In fact if Line 12 were not executed theres no execution of the convert_to_minutes function and therefore the examination of its line-by-line actions is meaningless.Now as the function is being processed right after the line result = num_hours * 60 is executed WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE VARIABLE RESULT?, Resolved,1
