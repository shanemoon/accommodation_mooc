Tuesday August 20th 2013 12:24 pm -04:00,What I found confusing with that question was the change in terminology. We learned about containing pointing and referring but when stores was added I wasnt sure if that could apply to both variables and memory addresses. Do memory addresses store values? Or does it only apply to variables?, Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 1:10 pm -04:00,Wow...I read the question completely wrong. I have absolutely no background in coding and therefore expected the type contract to list the vowels - i.e. (a e i o u) -> number - as I didnt see any code thus far that explained to the computer what the difference between a vowel and a consonant was to begin with so how could it count the vowels without that specific instruction? How does writing str tell the computer that its counting vowels?, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:45 am -04:00,Actually the grading says that this is one of the correct answers but that is false. It produces Hello - how - are - you which is not Hello-how-are-you so it should not be listed as correct, Approved Resolved,0

Monday September 16th 2013 7:15 pm -04:00,Heres what I wrote:collect_sequence =         for blah in str:        if blah in GATC:             collect_sequence = get_complement(blah)                 return collect_sequence, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 10:51 am -04:00,Sorry about that. Code has been edited.I figured I was supposed to concatenate but when I used get_complement(blah) + blah it says unsupported operand type(s) for +: NoneType and str so its not recognizing blah as a variable. I saw on another thread that someone used a similar expression to mine but it worked. Is it because they used terms other than blah?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 5:58 pm -04:00,I tried using that code but when I went to test it it only worked if I wrote update_score(player_info ANT). If I wrote update_score(Jonathan ANT) like the code suggests it returns this error: TypeError: Cant convert int object to str implicitlywhich I believe would screw things up if there were to be more than one player would it not?, Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:03 pm -04:00,Thanks! I found the question phrasing confusing and wasnt sure if that was supposed to be the end result or the initial input, Resolved,0
