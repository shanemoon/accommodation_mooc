Sunday September 1st 2013 9:49 am -04:00,Hello. Attila vagyok Belfastbol. Az assignmentet csinalom csak ugy tunik nem megy az autograder rendesen... :( ,None,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 9:45 am -04:00,I have done the first coding step uploaded it got 5 points so all seemed to work fine. An hour later I resubmitted this time with two more steps completed however the autograder still gives me 5 points only even if all the tests on my PC prove the code is correct. I am using Python 3. Any suggestions to what might be the issue here?, Resolved Locked,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 10:07 am -04:00,I did. The code is 100% correct. The seconds_difference is accepted as correct but the hours_difference for example is not. Feedback says ERROR: TypeError. How is that possible?!? Also tested my code on http://repl.it/languages/Python Works like a charm just like on my computer. There definitely has to be something wrong with the autograder.unsupported operand type(s) for -: NoneType and float, Resolved Locked,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 10:25 am -04:00,Python 3.3.2 is what I am using. However if you say that the online interpreter uses version 2 that proves even more that my code should work regardless of the version of Python used., Resolved Locked,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 11:21 am -04:00,Nope. I already checked that. I do not use print because the assignment handout says clearly not to. I am using return. Any other ideas? Though I suspect that its probably related to the autograder being down and not to my code..., Resolved Locked,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 10:41 am -04:00,Come on mate. Nobody is spamming here and nobody is inpatient. Theyre just confirming an error and the more people do that the more seriously will the issue be taken. You can always unsubscribe from the thread so that you would not get inundated by emails. ;) I find it very good that people are confirming actively these issues. It means they care and theyre active. You know (cu o randunica nu se face primavara) one swallow doesnt bring spring... so the more the better. ;), Resolved Locked,6
Sunday September 1st 2013 11:10 am -04:00,Laurentiu if there would be 100 people reporting it already I would almost agree with you but since were here to learn programming lets see how can we define programatically the severity of an error? What comes to my mind first is the number of error-reporting users being directly proportional with the level of severity. Therefore if 5 people report an error its probably not an error but if 500 do then its for sure an error and a big one at that. Also the time-frame of the error reports can be used as valuable data for example when did the issue start and when it stopped. The moment people stop accessing the thread theres a high chance the issue is solved. Yes if youre subscribed by email to a thread it can be annoying to receive an email every minute or so but guess what? The moment youll stop getting those it will be safe to assume the issue is solved and you yourself will benefit from that. , Resolved Locked,0
