Tuesday September 3rd 2013 5:04 pm -04:00,Consider this code:def sum(number1 number2):    print(number1 + number2)result = sum(1 3)After the code has been executed what value does result refer to?4Nothing. In Python None is used to represent nothing.For me the answer is 4 but it says it is wrong and the correct answer is none.Can anyone explain this?, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 8:11 pm -04:00,Hi Paul and JenI did all the codes.But My submission report says there are 05 errors.I analysed each and every error separately.For instance below is one of them.My answer is yes for this and rest of errors and all gives me the right output.Is there anything else wrong in my submission? If not I feel I must get 24/24.Please enlighten me on this regard.Thank you.Method Description:Have you tested your function with a valid DNA sequeunce that uses        all the nucleotides?Message:ERROR: AttributeErrorReplacerModule object has no attribute is_valid_sequence, Unresolved,0
