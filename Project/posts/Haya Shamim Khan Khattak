Sunday September 8th 2013 6:04 am -04:00,Hi downloaded and installed the required version of Python on my pc running windows 8 for the first few days it worked fine but now when I open IDLE I get the same error most of you have experienced i.e. IDLEs subprocess didnt make connection. Either IDLE cant start a subprocess or personal firewall software is blocking a connectionI have tried the suggested solutions but they didnt work for me I have to complete the assignment and quiz. Help is appreciated. , Resolved,0
