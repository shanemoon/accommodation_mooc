Monday August 26th 2013 5:05 pm -04:00,I dont want to give the answer away but think about this way:You have a function that converts temperature in F to its equivalent in C.  convert_to_celsius(number)And you have another function that tells u in F whats the temperature of an american city is. usa_city_temperature(Seattle)You know that you first function takes argument number and returns a float. You know that your second functions takes argument str and returns a number. So with all that information you know that your second function /* usa_city_temperature(Atlanta) */ will return a number .And a NUMBER is exactly what you want to feed to your first function /*convert_to_celsius(number) */. So instead of writing many long lines of code you can Feed a number to your first function right from the output of your second function. So replace (number) in your first function with the header of your second function (thats recalling a function). And that way you can have it all solved in one line. I hope that helps ! ! ! Cheers , Unresolved,4
