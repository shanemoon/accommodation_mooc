Open Disk Utility (Applications > Utilities > Disk Utilities) select you Mac drive and then in the panel to the right click on the button repair permissions. See this [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Disk_Utility_screenshot.png] for a sample of what you should see on your screen.Then try installing IDLE again.,None,0

Saturday August 24th 2013 5:54 pm -04:00,MelissaSounds like IDLE has corrupted preferences. Im not at my Mac right now. First make sure idle is not open or just stuck. In the finder click on the Go menu (I think thats what its called) hold down the option key and youll see a Library item appear in the menu. Click it and then inside it open the Preferences folder. Look in there you should have an IDLE folder or files with IDLE or python in their name. Trash them and try opening IDLE again.Alternatively Shift+Command+G in the finder opens a go to... Window. Type in ~/Library/Preferences should take you to the same folder.,None,0
Wednesday August 21st 2013 11:32 pm -04:00,I downloaded new IDLE themes from http://www.roguecode.net/2011/09/python-idle-themes.html and I use the Tango theme. Syntax highlighting makes it so much easier to work with the code!,None,1

Thursday August 22nd 2013 12:07 am -04:00,I know well see this in week 2 but check how this all works in the Python Visualizer at http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=x+%3D+2%0Ay+%3D+3%0Az+%3D+x+%2B+y%0A%0Ax+%3D+6%0Ay+%3D+7%0A&mode=display&cumulative=false&heapPrimitives=true&drawParentPointers=true&textReferences=false&showOnlyOutputs=false&py=3&curInstr=4 This website saved me from more than a few headaches! The trick is that we have to learn how Python works not the way wed like it to work. As said in the lecture Python stores a reference to a memory address where a value is stored. If you look closer when x = 2gets re-assigned to x = 6youll notice that the object int 2 (on the right-most column) disappears. The int 6 doesnt take its place in the same memory address but is stored in a new memory address to which x now points to. The int 2 is simply gone (its probably still in the same memory address but nothing points to it). Its one of the main rules of Python I learned: you cant change an int in place (in the same memory address). I hope I made myself clear and didnt confuse you more!, Resolved,2
Saturday August 24th 2013 11:48 am -04:00,I use Pythonista on the iPad and I love it. Keep in mind that it runs Python 2.7 though so some exercise will return a different result from what you see in the video or throw an error., Resolved,0
Saturday August 24th 2013 5:59 pm -04:00,As you in the interactive console (white background) or in the text editor (dark background)? You have a immediate response after you press enter you have to be in the console. Also make sure you didnt open any parentheses or youll need to close them to tell Python youre finished with your input.You can reset Pythonista by double pressing the home button to see the open apps then touch and hold the Pythonista icon until it wiggles and touch the x that appears in the corner. Open the app again and it should work. I do this from to time to time to reset the console., Resolved,0
Sunday August 25th 2013 10:07 am -04:00,I read in different books on Python that everything in Python is an object so its a good point to keep in mind while learning the language., Resolved,0
