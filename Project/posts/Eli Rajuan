Thursday August 29th 2013 10:06 am -04:00,HiPlease refer to my solution:def round_trip():    time_in_seconds = 60 * (time_to_go(place1) + time_to_go(next_place(place1)) + time_to_go(next_place(next_place(place1))) + time_to_go(next_place(next_place(next_place(place1)))))    return print(int(time_in_seconds // 3600) : int(60 * (time_in_seconds / 3600 - time_in_seconds // 3600)) : int(time_in_seconds - 3600 * int(time_in_seconds // 3600) - 60 * int(60 * (time_in_seconds / 3600 - time_in_seconds // 3600))))I cant figure how to do it without a space between the :.,None,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 3:13 am -04:00,HiI would like to know why my program isnt working please:d = [1 2]n = 100for i in range(3 n):    is_prime = True    for y in range(2 n - 1):        if i % y == 0:            is_prime = False    if is_prime:        d.append(i)print(d),None,0
