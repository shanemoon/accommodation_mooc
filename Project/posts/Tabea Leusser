Friday September 6th 2013 5:30 pm -04:00,I tried debugging a function with the python visualizer and got a little bit annoyed because it doesnt allow you to set breakpoints (I think) and stops after 300 steps. But what if you dont care about the first 300 steps and are only interested in steps 400 - 410?So my question is: Is there a way to set a breakpoint in the python visualizer like you can in Eclipse/Java? Or should I just go ahead and download PyDev for Eclipse? Or is there an other good way to debug code that you know of?I know that this is going a bit farther then what were doing here but I just thought maybe somebody knows something useful., Unresolved,0
