Monday August 19th 2013 1:36 am -04:00,Hello EveryoneAnother from the US...I joined because I wanted to touch base with how programming works. Though I have learned a little coding in HTML5 I know nothing else in the Programming world. My husband is a software engineer and has created many programs and apps. I hope one day I can be one of those who programs something useful. Good luck to everyone!!!,None,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 1:32 pm -04:00,Is there any way to do the exercises and assignments for LTP2 and get a feedback on it since the class is over?? It would be nice to see how I did., Resolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 5:34 pm -04:00,Though it pauses for the quiz question there is nothing showing up. The moment I click on the play button it continues with the lecture. Is anyone else having that issue?, Resolved,2
Monday August 19th 2013 6:39 pm -04:00,I am using Chrome..all the other lecture questions worked fine. Once it reaches to the question nothing pops up. It just pauses the video but still the video is display waiting to be played. I thought maybe clicking the play button would make it show up but it just continues with the lecture. If I dont answer the question it will not showed quiz attempted which meant I skipped the question., Resolved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 10:07 pm -04:00,Thank you! In my case I had to change from Flash to HTML5  and it worked. , Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 3:43 pm -04:00,Though I have understood the answer to questionprint (ba + na * 2 + muffin) would equal to bananamuffin...why then when I type in that answer it is still says its incorrect? I thought I had to take out the single quote which I did and still was incorrect. I gave a space to the word and stil incorrect. The explanation says to take out the double quotes. A little confused...., Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 3:53 pm -04:00,I am not sure if they wanted the explanation of why the answer was displayed like that or what the answer would be when I inputed the code above. Even then why would I have to take out the double quotes? If I do take out the double quotes I would get thisTraceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#12> line 1 in <module>    print(ba + na * 2 + muffin)NameError: name ba is not defined>>> , Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 4:08 pm -04:00,I did get that same answer and which I had entered in as an answer for the quiz yet says its incorrect. I was confused in why that answer would yield an incorrect answer., Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 2:14 am -04:00,Though I have read all the forums on returning statements I am still clueless in creating one. I was trying to create one from Exercise 2 about is_passing_grade. Though for that particular question it is asking the Type Contract which I understood. Now to finish that call we need to write a return statement. I have tried all the options I could think of (and all of them are wrong) so if someone could explain to me one more time how to get that I would really appreciate it.Thanks, Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 11:53 am -04:00,I agree with you that we have not covered the topic yet..maybe the wrong problem to show as an example. I think the main question is do I include the parameters in the return statement with its arguments? For instance the quiz question asking covering the topic of function reuse. If we take the first call in this case the temperature of Atlanta....def usa_city_temperature (city)(str) -> floatReturn the value of a temperature in Farenheit degree with a given city name.>>>usa_city_temperature(Atlanta)72Now when we write this return statement do I need to include city in my statement and the temperature Im calling for?This is where the confusing starts for me.Thank, Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 1:20 pm -04:00,I really appreciate your help. In the is_passing_grade I have return the statement you have just mentioned above and all it gave back was pass for all numbers. That was why I was so confused in what I am missing in my return statement. This is so redundant but would the return statement for the above question be return temperature(city)...no matter what return I put it gives me a NameError, Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 11:54 am -04:00,Thanks Ohad for your response in clearing up the boolean concept. , Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 5:25 pm -04:00,As said in the description my scores will not update. I got 17.50 out of 18 on my first attempt. So I attempted again with all the correct answers but yet got 17.50. Was wondering if I made a mistake again so attempted a third time making real sure that all my answers are correct. To my surprise 17.50 even after answers were all correct. I dont know how to go about this....if one of the professors could help out that would be great.Thanks, Unresolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 5:51 pm -04:00,I can agree that I made mistakes on the first attempt. Reading through the feedback and understand where I was wrong I went ahead for my second attempt making sure that the one question that I needed to fix was fixed. Submitted it and got the same score. I knew I marked all the answers I needed to mark for that particular question. So I just gave it another just to make sure I was going to get a perfect score. Still gave me the same score showing the same mistakes as my first and second attempts. I dont know if I should attempt again as I have a good feeling its going to give me the same score. How do I prove this to the professors though as I know the grading is automated?, Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 7:50 pm -04:00,What does  !=  mean? Im thinking the number on the left should not equal to the value to the right.  , Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 8:42 pm -04:00,Why would the code work for one part but not the others? With the get_seconds equation...I got 1 right and the other 3 I got AssertionErrors. , Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 12:00 pm -04:00,Im not sure if you have resolved the get_minutes part. If not let me know, Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 7:10 pm -04:00,When we type help(input) we see that the return is a string. A string added to another string will only show each string value put together. IN this case the return would be 22 instead of 4.Hope that makes sense., Resolved,2
Friday September 6th 2013 11:19 am -04:00,I would like to know why 8 = dollars is False whereas 8 >= dollars is True. Im not sure why the > would make a difference? Thats pretty much the only difference between the two expressions., Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 6:45 pm -04:00,I understand the single equal and double equal. I think where im confused at is if 8 = dollars is false then why would 8 greater than or equal to dollars be true? Isnt it mean in that expression that it can equal to 8 as well? , Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 7:15 pm -04:00,My mistake...sorry. It was with a double equal sign. Though I get the correct answer I just wanted to know the reason behind it. I understand it now. Thanks everyone for their help., Resolved,1
Tuesday September 17th 2013 6:43 pm -04:00,I can see through this thread and previous threads that we only have 3 hours to complete the final exam. Just wondering if the final exams are the same layout as our exercises or are they like our assignments? I am a little afraid I wont be able to complete it within the 3 hour time frame especially if I take a day to complete the exercises and a couple days to complete my assignments. , Resolved,3
Monday September 9th 2013 5:52 pm -04:00,Im still a little confused. The explanation for that quiz is that it is a boolean accumulator. How do we change that to True if there is a vowel found? We cant just write a return statement either as we have not answered the if statement., Unresolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 4:52 pm -04:00,Why cant the expression be queen_of_hearts.rfind(heads)?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:50 am -04:00,I am having some problems with this question as well. Though I have the looping function it doesnt really loop. I mean it works for single characters such as A = T but when I put TA = A...it wont loop to the second character. Any help would be great. Thanks, Resolved,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 3:19 pm -04:00,Can someone explain to me why the 2 is added to 4? Though I got the length of list 1 is two but isnt it that if we do a range of 2 it goes up but doesnt include 2. So in this case the answer would include 1 but not the 2 in the first list., Resolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 4:30 pm -04:00,>>> i = [12]>>> for i in range(len(i)):	print(i)	01Since this is a range of a list it seems like the 0 would represent i[0] which is 1 and 1 would represent i[1] which is 2...and this is why both indexes are included...am I on the right track here?, Resolved,1
Monday September 23rd 2013 7:50 pm -04:00,I thought the same as what python gave above. Since the length of [12] is two the range of 2 would be 0 and 1. Without further thinking I thought that only the 1 would be included and not 2 in the list. The reasoning from my prior comment made sense to me or at least that gave the correct answer. So I am assuming that the range of the length of any list the expected output would include everything within the list. I hope that made sense., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 3:33 pm -04:00,I am also getting that error. When calling the num_words_on_board function it is returning the correct answer. I know Tom has stated that the return type is not correct. If that is the case why is it working in IDLE? , Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 6:30 pm -04:00,On my first attempt I correctly answered this question. Because of other mistakes I attempted the exercise again. However with the same question on the second attempt it was marked as incorrect. Just wondering how this is possible? , Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 7:04 pm -04:00,Found my mistake. Its hilarious when you think they made the mistake and to look back and it was your own! :0I, Resolved,1
Sunday September 29th 2013 1:16 pm -04:00,I had a question on the yes_no problem in Week 3 course wiki. I had my code posted but I wasnt suppose to post any code...Its kind of hard to talk about where I am having problem with but I will try my best. The yes_no problem asks the user a question and if the response given is yes or no then a sentence will respond back to the user. If the answer is not no or yes then it should prompt the question to enter a yes or no response. I wrote an if statement to do the following. I feel like the code I written should work however when the function is written in IDLE the answer to either yes or no prompts back the question to enter a yes or no. I tried doing a for loop but that doesnt help either. Any suggestions would be great...hopefully this is understandable...sorry guys.,None,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 1:44 pm -04:00,Ill try that...lets see if that will work. Thanks for responding. Ill get back with the update.,None,0
Monday September 30th 2013 5:05 pm -04:00,I agree with everyone about not being able to discuss our misunderstandings with each other on the Final. Not posting our codes is one thing but having someone to better state the question(rephrasing) in a way that is more easier to understand is another and at least for me that would be very helpful. Nonetheless I also would like to say thank you to everyone who has helped me and for those who got helped which of was benefit for me. Couldnt have done this without you guys. Good luck to everyone..., Resolved,2
Monday September 30th 2013 6:15 pm -04:00,I looked into the course that Alain posted...6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Pythonand saw that this course is working with Python version 2.7. Since we are learning on version 3.3 would we have a better chance at understanding the information at an intermediate level? Just wondering...the class does sound quite interesting,None,0
Monday September 30th 2013 10:48 pm -04:00,I see good links for other classes to take. Are these recommended through coursera? I think im going to enroll in that course too Debashis. Thanks for the link,None,0
