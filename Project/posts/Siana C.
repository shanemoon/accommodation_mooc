Tuesday August 20th 2013 7:55 am -04:00,I wonder....the discussion in this forum suggests that many of you already have experience with the basics of programming which is all this course aims to provide.  I have zero experience so am very grateful for the choice to use the most simplest programming language. Curious...why are you taking this course?,None,8

Monday September 9th 2013 12:04 pm -04:00,Lynn I want you to know I too scored 15 out of 18  about 3 hours ago and was ready to have a meltdown.  I could not figure question 14 or 15. Then I came here and saw your frustration and I found company :) .I read all the responses that others provided you reviewed the video one last time and took a 3rd and final shot at the exercise 10minutes till deadline. 18/18! I share this because through your frustration and determination in a way you inspired me to try again :) .THANK YOU!, Resolved,2

Sunday September 8th 2013 11:53 am -04:00,I came here to inquire the same.  I know I will not receive credit but if I submit exercise 1 will it still be looked at and responded to? Thanks in advance.,None,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 7:48 am -04:00,Leea you and I appear to be in the same boat! At the outset of this course I borrowed 3 books from the library about the history of computers the internet & hardware/software.  I learned about FORTRAN & BASIC- the pioneering computer languages the room sized early computers the origins of IBM Microsoft Intel etc. It was all so fascinating!  I kept finding myself marveling that so much was going on behind the scenes in computer tech while I was playing jumprope and hide&seek with my friends in the 80s.  I realized that I like probably too many others assumed that computing technology was something that came about in the 90s.  It completely blew my mind to discover Charles Babbage Alan Turing John Backus Thomas Kurtz JCR Licklider ; that HP was formed in 1939!; the ENIAC; that Apple was founded the year I was born; that Bill Gates has been playing with computers since he was 13! I started to understanD the big picture.   I know that was a bit lengthy but it is just so amazing :) .I as you discovered this fundamental course still to be a challenge. Exploring computer history and augmenting the course work with your own private learning will help but as you mentioned below that leads to extra hours in the day that one just may not have.  I felt a tinge of sadness when you concluded you may end up just auditing the course.  I fear the same fate for myself. I see that at the outset you were/are just as enthusiastic as me in COMPLETING it.  There is something to getting a stamp of approval.I am waiting to hear back about the extension of deadline too. Well see!  For now back to Python. Good luck to you Leea.,None,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 7:27 am -04:00,I must echo the sentiments above. I excitedly registered for this course having no....and I mean ZERO experience with programming and never so much as taken a computer science course. I completed the Python download the survey watched all the videos & did all the quizzes. I celebrated! Somehow....somehow....I totally overlooked the exercises :( .I woke up at 6:30am EST this morning and locked myself in a my room prepared to devote the next 3 hours to reviewing week 1&2 lectures in order to complete assignment 1 by the hard deadline tomorrow. To my horror I noticed the exercises and that I already missed the deadline to receive credit for exercise 1 ;(  .  Really I am not sure how this happened. I am typically very thorough and recall reading the instructions rules and course expectations.  Is there ANY move to extend the exercise 1 deadline? I am one of the small percentage of students who will request credit. I want to be of the small percentage who complete the course!  Assignment 1 threw me so my plan was to review videos over the next few hours as many times as needed until I grasped them and them submit assignment 1.   If exercise 1 will prevent me from getting credit anyway that effort will be in vain.  It is now 7:28am EST Sunday.  I will be on standby!Thank you in advance. Again I am an EXTREME newbie to programming but not the process of self-learning which I am committed to.,None,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 8:35 am -04:00,Ahhhh....now I understand my error in thinking! I believe I understood this when I signed up yet over the last week or so somehow forgot. You will not receive credit translated in my mind to you will be ineligible to receive a certificate for the course.  Okay....Im back on track.  Thank you Anonymous. Thank you Etienne for pointing out the new deadlines! Ive synced the above page to my google calendar as per the instructions. Now back to the course for me!,None,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 4:46 pm -04:00,Yes...A quick update. Im on a self-rewarded 20min break right now; Id been at it on and off since 8:00am! The average 6min video takes me about 20 as I rewind 4-5 times throughout then take notes then more notes then watch again...lol.  No shame though! I do hope you choose to continue to receive a certificate. It is nothing short of euphoric when the concepts ones been struggling with start to click.  Cheers!,None,0

Sunday September 8th 2013 11:34 am -04:00,Despite my initial request for an extension -based on my own misunderstanding- I am a stickler for time.  I fully support & promote the use of deadlines in all aspects of life.I agree that the staff should not be arbitrarily imposed upon to consider changing deadlines.  At the same time Im guessing Coursera is still trying to see what works best in accomplishing the ultimate realization of its mission and appreciates feedback from those it is trying to reach.  The model is still evolving.Pat you are a class act :) .Anonymous- This is a shared open and supportive learning environment and yet you are here...anonymously.  People are humbly sharing their identities & challenges as they seek greater knowledge and understanding.  Does it not strike you as obvious that the main reason anyone taking a self-selected self-disciplined self-challenging course IS to learn? Your comment urging the focusing on learning is not only unnecessary it is grossly impolite.  No harm done though; I ignore those who choose to remain hidden : ) .,None,1
Monday September 9th 2013 10:04 am -04:00,HELP! I must get back to work but the deadline to resubmit is in 116minutes.  I achieved a score of 15 out of 18 and I cannot spend any more time on this as my schedule is already horrifically backed up this morning.

Tuesday September 10th 2013 11:52 pm -04:00,Hi Aaron....yes I read your comments to Teresa then tried a few more times before I posted. Ill look at the link. My lack of understanding is not resolved but I greatly thank you for responding :), Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 11th 2013 8:57 am -04:00,It may be helpful to explain my thoughts and maybe someone can graciously point out my errors in reasoning:Ques 6 description:The first parameter is a UTC offset specifying a time zone and the second parameter is a time in that time zone. Return the equivalent UTC+0 time. Be sure to call to_24_hour_clock to convert the time to a time on a 24 hour clock before returning.Each of the examples given indicate a different utc offset (+0 -1 +12) so I am reasoning that each example represents a different time zone. Yet the description suggests that the utc offset should be specific to that time zone implying there is only one time zone under consideration.  My understanding is that we are supposed to create a code that works in all cases over all time zones. But how if the parameters in each example demonstrate that different time zones are being used????????Im going to resubmit 2 more times before the deadline. , Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:06 pm -04:00,HarmonyI think you and I and a small percentage of others are the real beginners in this class. I observed through browsing the forums here that most of people taking this course are not truly beginners. Many have a little more than basic familiarity with programming concepts & mathematical thinking.This is not isolated to this course though.  I read an article that reported research showing that the majority of MOOC students already have degrees or moderate training in fields related to the courses they are taking.  Many are just using these as refreshers or to practice their skills.  I signed up for this course because though I have been an end-user of computers for over 20 years this is the first time I am pursuing intimate knowledge of all that goes on behind the scenes. Though I never sucked at math in HS or college I never possessed the stomach or discipline for anything beyond pre-cal.  So I decided to test my mental rigor and stamina with this course.I knew this would be challenging but it is also 5x more time consuming than I budgeted for.  Not telling you what to do; just offer solace so that you know you are not alone. I have chosen to press on despite a few meltdowns and extreme moments of self-loathing :). My cumulative grade so far is about an 86%; I usually berate myself if I perform at anything less than 95%. In this case Ill take it.You can check a few of my previous threads & posts to feel company in your suffering :).  Best Wishes :), Resolved,3
