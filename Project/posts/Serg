Friday September 27th 2013 9:36 am -04:00,Hello<quote>These exercises are intended to get you to open IDLE and work on small pieces of code. If you have been copying/pasting/editing/running the code and trying out expressions in the Python shell then congrats youre doing the right thing!If on the other hand you have been avoiding using IDLE and youre struggling with the exercises then you arent learning as much as you should. Open up IDLE and try out all the code as you do the exercise!</quote>I dont really understand why it is so when doing exercises with a code? Why is it better to copy ==> paste in the IDLE ==> get the answer and 100/100 points? Isnt it better to consider a code in your head and get kinda pleasure that you remember the lectures and can trace the code step by step getting the right answer? Or otherwise if you do a mistake - understand that you didnt get the material well and go through it again for better knowledges. Instead of copy/paste work having 100% result every time no matter if you know what the pragram is doing by this code.p. s. Sorry for my english :D,None,0

Sunday September 29th 2013 7:14 am -04:00,Hiin the lecture Writing files when you use askopenfile() it returns a string containing file path. But in the a3_driver.py it returns this:<_io.TextIOWrapper name=D:/Programs/PythonIDLE/HomeWork/A3/wordlist1.txt mode=r encoding=cp1251>So I cant open this file.I CAN open it using just a3.py function read_words and this function returns words list. But I CANT open it with a3_driver.py the function stops cuz of invalid file.Whats wrong here?, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 7:17 am -04:00,Oh I got it they are different functions actually. Im gonna try to get it somehow., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 7:19 am -04:00,Yes I just got it and fixed it thanksI shouldve used this:def read_words(words_file):    words_list =     for line in words_file:        words_list.append(line.rstrip())    return words_listInstead of this:def read_words(words_file):     (file open for reading) -> list of str    Return a list of all words (with newlines removed) from open file    words_file.    Precondition: Each line of the file contains a word in uppercase characters    from the standard English alphabet.        words_list =     words_file = open(words_file)    for line in words_file:        words_list.append(line.rstrip())    return words_list, Unresolved,0
