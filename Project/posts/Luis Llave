Youre able to download the videos and subtitles (I prefer in .srt format) then these are two files; the subtitles file can be edit with any text editor and you can edit the words and the time when they appear.

I cant help you im not using IDLE dont work for me (using Linux Mageia).3. Theres a glossary. You can access it by click in the Course Wiki option at left menu in this page.4. I dont know.

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:58 pm -04:00,Very rare. I suggest to copy all the code into another file (for security reason) close the IDLE and try to open and edit a1.py again if you cant you can delete it an rename the copy made before as a1.py.I think that can be a problem with IDLE a problem with free space in disk or a problem with operating system (include virus as a possible reason)., Resolved,0

Friday September 6th 2013 11:23 pm -04:00,When all begins only the convert_to_minutes and convert_to_seconds variables are created in the Global Frame there isnt any other frame; in that moment the red arrow have to point to line 20 then line 20 is executed (green arrow points it) an a frame for convert_to_seconds is created. When line 16 is executed (inside convert_to_seconds) the frame for convert_to_minutes is created no previous to that.In minute 3:27 the green arrow points to line 8 (return minutes is in execution) red arrow points to the next step (under line 8); its the final second of life for convert_to_minutes when line 8 is completely executed frame for convert_to_minutes is deleted.I hope to help you., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 3:50 pm -04:00,Its simple: when the first index doesnt exist the assumed value is 0 (the beginning); when the last index doesnt exist the assumed value is len(string) (which means that it take the last char in the string). You can substitute the missing index for the value given and thats exactly how it works.The negative index begins in -1. For s=Call Me Again s[-1] is n s[-2] is i s[-4] is g. Then character g have two index: s[9] and s[-4] (one positive and another negative)., Unresolved,0
