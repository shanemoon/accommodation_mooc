Monday August 26th 2013 1:04 pm -04:00,I cant figure out whats the correct answer for the first quizIve typed (str)->number which I thought was correct but it wasnt as an explanation I have got: The answer is of the form:(____) -> ____where the lines are replaced with Python types to describe the parameter(s) and return value.When referring to a string use str.  When referring to an integer use int.Still I have used the correct format but maybe the parameter is not correct., Resolved,3

Saturday September 14th 2013 4:45 pm -04:00,I cant seem to properly use the integer in order to position the str or rather I lack the vision to order them properly.For example I made this as a test>>> insert_sequence(CCGGAT2) which should give meCCATGGHowever in all of my attempts the second string is always placed first. Apparently the int is not used? How should I?To use slicing you have to type: a[:] am I right?I did noticed an interesting thing while playing with the Learned to Program from the lectures as in when I added ed that would be assigned to the requested position via int.I feel like Im getting close frustratingly close....., Unresolved,0
