Thursday August 29th 2013 7:30 pm -04:00,I cant see the quizzes in my desktop browseronly see the blue question mark (viewing online). Perhaps its because Im watching the webm video version. (Using Linux and Firefox)I can see the quizzes in my phone browser (Android 2.3.5) which is obviously very impractical to use in this instance . I assume its running Flash video on the phone. I cant really confirm this., Unresolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 8:45 pm -04:00,Update: Disabled a browser extension in Firefox called Flashblock 1.5.17 this resolved my problem.Using Opera Browser also works with quizzes.Try disabling extensions and add-ons until you find a possible solution or install an alternative browser or re-install your current browser without extra add-ons or extensions., Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 9:28 pm -04:00,Im rather nervous about this as its the first instance of a 3-hour time limit and only one submission allowed for a performance evaluation. Of course its an exam :PIm hoping that there is a trial or practice exam  somewhere which one can do as an exercise.A mock exam as an exercise would help a great deal in improving exam skills and understanding the exam format so you have less chance of making a technical error like inadvertently starting the real exam prematurely.It would also help in understanding the subject material better ., Resolved,1
