Tuesday August 20th 2013 11:38 pm -04:00,I think both versions (32 bit and 64 bit) work on 64 bit version of windows.I use windows 7 - 64 bit version and installed the x64 version of Python 3 and it works well.Also windows 7 64 bit version support 32 bit applications so don`t worry about what version you should use as long as your operating system support 32 bit programs., Resolved,1
