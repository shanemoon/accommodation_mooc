Friday September 13th 2013 7:31 am -04:00,Hi guys! Can someone please give me a hint with is_valid_sequence is Assignment 2? Im using this code def is_valid_sequence(dna):        >>>is_valid_sequence(ATCGGC)    True    >>>is_valid_sequence(ATBCTU)    False    >>>is_valid_sequence(aTCGA)    False        result = True    non_valid = QWERYUIOPSDFHJKLZXVBNM    for char in dna:        if char not in non_valid and dna.isupper():            return result        else:            return Falsebut the results Im getting are incorrect.p.s Ive just re-watched week 4 and reviewed exercise 4 and I still have no clue. Starting feeling myself dumb!, Unresolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 7:46 am -04:00,hmm Im starting getting something. So if IDLE finds a return statement it doesnt even look for other characters? But how do I check for every letter? I doubt that I should write a str.find function for every single letter which is not an nucleotide(i.d. QWERYUIOPSDFHJKLZXVBNM). I believe there should be a more neat way of doing this problem could you pls point me to it? , Unresolved,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 10:06 am -04:00,Hi everyone! Ive decided to write a function for this problem here is an example code:def summa(num):    result = 0    while num <100:        result = result +num        num = num +2The thing is is that when I run this code it says result is not defined. While running thise code above in the shell (first assigning num to int then assighing result to zero) it works perfectly. Can someone please exlain what Im doing wrong? , Resolved,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 10:39 am -04:00,Hi Tom I used for loop to solve make_str_from_row but after reading your post about using str.join() I got curious and gave it a shot but I could not find a way to write a one liner with str.join() to solve make_str_from_row. Could you pls give me a hint how to use str.join()? , Unresolved,0
