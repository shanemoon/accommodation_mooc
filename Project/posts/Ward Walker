Monday September 2nd 2013 8:12 pm -04:00,I was wondering about docstring examples.  It seems that in many cases the docstring examples imply that values are being printed instead of returned because when invoking the actual docstring examples printed values will show up in IDLE but returned values will not (unless theyre printed after the function call).Im not sure what is common or best practice.For example in the docstring below the type contract & description  clearly indicate that an integer is being returned.  But the docstring examples imply that values will be printed instead of being returned (because how else would the values be presented within IDLE after the function call?).def get_num_upper_chars(word):    (str) -> int   Returns the number of uppercase characters in word.   >>> get_num_upper_chars(BooK)   2   >>> get_num_upper_chars(BOOK)   4   Are the examples in the below docstring better?  I think theyre a little better because they dont contradict the rest of the docstring.  def get_num_upper_chars(word):    (str) -> int   Returns the number of uppercase characters in word.   >>> print get_num_upper_chars(BooK)   2   >>> print get_num_upper_chars(BOOK)   4   , Resolved,0
