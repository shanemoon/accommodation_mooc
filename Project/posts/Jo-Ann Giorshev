Friday September 20th 2013 8:13 am -04:00,RE:  Week 4 Exercises - Question 9.  I have tested my code and my answer works.  It produces -1 if there is no occurrence or 1 occurrence.  It gives me the location if there is a 2nd occurrence.  I am using the index of first occurrence using find function adding 1 in it and pass it as index for second call to function to find the 2nd occurrence.  Im not using square brackets. Why is it marking me wrong??????  , Unresolved,0
