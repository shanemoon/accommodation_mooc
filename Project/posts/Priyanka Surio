Monday September 9th 2013 5:38 pm -04:00,Hi allI suggest submitting a few days before the deadline. I also believe according to the syllabus that even if you missed assignment one if you submit the rest of the assignments on time and receive almost full credit then you will be eligible for the statement of accomplishment. Let us dissolve this conversation please. Thank youPriyanka, Resolved,0
