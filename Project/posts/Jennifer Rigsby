Friday September 27th 2013 8:24 pm -04:00,This sounds like the problem I have. What did you do to fix it?This is what my board looks like when I print it out: [[E F J A J C O W S S ] [S D G K S R F D F F ] [A S R J D U S K L K ] [H E A N D N D J W A ] [A N S D N C N E O P ] [P M S N F H H E J E ] [J E P Q L Y N X D L]]Is that what yours looked like?, Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 6:26 pm -04:00,I have gotten the a3_driver.py to run fine before but the highest score Ive been able to get on the assignment is 34/37. I think the problem must be in the for loops so I will only post those:make_str_from_column functionfor i in board:        string += i[column_index]board_contains_word_in_column functionfor column_index in range(len(board[0])):Here is the error I get when running a3_driver with my current code:Traceback (most recent call last):  File C:\Python33\a3_driver.py line 100 in <module>    play_game(players board words)  File C:\Python33\a3_driver.py line 45 in play_game    num_remaining = a3.num_words_on_board(board words) - len(found_words)  File C:\Python33\a3.py line 161 in num_words_on_board    if board_contains_word(board word):  File C:\Python33\a3.py line 111 in board_contains_word    return board_contains_word_in_column(board word) or board_contains_word_in_row(board word)  File C:\Python33\a3.py line 95 in board_contains_word_in_column    if word in make_str_from_column(board column_index):  File C:\Python33\a3.py line 57 in make_str_from_column    string += i[column_index]IndexError: list index out of rangeTests I failed on the assignment submission:student: test_a3.Test_02_ReadBoard.test_02_square_symmetric_boardstudent: test_a3.Test_02_ReadBoard.test_03_rectangular_assymetric_boardstudent: test_a3.Test_02_ReadBoard.test_03_square_assymetric_boardIve tried it several different ways by now but at this point Im just going in circles.

Friday September 27th 2013 8:01 pm -04:00,Ah I missed that when I was focusing on if all the letters were there. Thank you. But I still cant figure out why an extra empty string is added to all but the last row. I tried to change what I was doing with range(len()) in a few places tried to use rstrip() and I only made more errors come up on submission and wasnt able to remove the empty string.I still get the same empty string at the end of all but the last row. Thank you for the help by the way.Edit: I removed my code from here. Instead of using a temporary list to hold the characters I added each character to an empty string which I then converted to a list as it was appended to the main board list. Honestly Im not really sure what the difference is.Anyway I now have a working a3_drive.py and 37/37., Resolved,0
