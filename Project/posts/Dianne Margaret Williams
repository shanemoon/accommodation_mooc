Sunday September 1st 2013 11:03 am -04:00,Thanks for posting the Week 2 status report. Its really encouraging to see how many people are doing the lectures and working on the coursework. Im wondering how it compares to the first time the course was run. Are the numbers much the same?,None,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:31 am -04:00,Some of the courses I am taking I end up auditing rather than doing all the coursework. Im still learning by watching the lectures its just not something that people can see/measure via a finished product or anything. Also because I have health issues it might take me a couple of attempts to be well enough to get through a course. Thats one of the beauties of Coursera though - many of the courses are offered more than once. Like this one... :),None,0
Friday September 27th 2013 4:29 am -04:00,I dont think they dumb down the Coursera courses - theres just a limit on what you can do in only a few weeks. At university you usually take courses over a full semester or more so that allows a longer course. Im reallly enjoying that this is a beginner course and not too much time. Im learning a lot now and then I get a break before the next course in this series is offered. Win-win., Resolved,2
Friday September 27th 2013 4:23 am -04:00,When you say we only get one attempt does this mean we can save our answers as we go like we can in the quizzes? In one of the quizzes there was a note to say you could click on a graphic to enlarge it but when I did it took me out of the quiz and I lost all my answers in the quiz. Saving as we go prevents this from happening and I really dont want to lose all my work because I make a wrong click somewhere., Resolved,1

Friday September 27th 2013 8:32 am -04:00,Thanks for the cheat sheet link James. Even if I dont understand the whole sheet just by looking at it now its a useful reminder of the things that we have learned. , Unresolved,0
