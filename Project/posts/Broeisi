Wednesday August 28th 2013 2:21 pm -04:00,I have a question or idea...Will we be learning about tkinter toolkit?The toolkit used in assignment 1??I hope so because its pretty cool and also nice to make GUIs instead of only text programs...Can one of the teachers answer this question for me?RegardsBroeisi,None,0

Wednesday August 28th 2013 4:24 pm -04:00,Sure but none covers python3... everyone covers python 2 and tkinter is not compatible between the two.There a lots of changes...This question was more of an idea for a third sequel of this course :)Or an added extra week with GUI programming in tkinter.Got the point :D,None,0
