Saturday September 28th 2013 4:42 am -04:00,As a beginner in programming and also having some problems with English at the beginning of the course I only watched the videos with undertitles. But after some time I found out that as well as I have to try everything in idle I have to write down step by step. Otherwise I always miss important parts and can not solve the exercises and assignments. I have a lot of work to do using this method but for me it seems the only chance to learn a little bit to use Python. The first time I watched this video for me it also was too quick and the main problem was that I had not understood where to get the text from but the second time looking I used Idle and writing down step by step and soon it became clear. , Unresolved,1
