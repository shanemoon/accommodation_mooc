Saturday September 14th 2013 2:16 am -04:00,I liked this assignment though it didn allow to use methods. BUT! what i didnt like that it doesnt clarify what to do with non-valid outputs. Should i return empty string? False? False? 0? What do you do stupid biologist? It took a while to upload different solutions.and why not using methods after all? to teach you thinking out of the box? I have no programming experience so i dont know what is pythonic and what is not but definitely would like to learn and hadnt been informed on this yet., Unresolved,0
