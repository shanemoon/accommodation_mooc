Wednesday August 21st 2013 9:52 am -04:00,After saving the triangle.py file why does area(34) keep telling me that height is not defined. Yet when I ask for perimeter(123) I get the correct result. I never defined side1 or side2 or side3?, Resolved,0
Wednesday August 21st 2013 10:30 am -04:00,There is no definition statement for height. That is my issue. Why does height not base need to be defined. Why did I never have to define side1 side2 or side3 for perimeter to work?  Is it something to do with restarting the compiler? What is a Global name?, Resolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 12:54 pm -04:00,I found just using copy and paste from the code window to the shell window for the examples or Alt+p and change the parameters works.  Im new to programming so I did one function at a time. When I had the body written save run module (F5) then I tested the examples plus a few of my own.  Make the numbers bigger that 24 hrs -> 37 hours or use 0. When all the examples returned the correct values I moved on to the next function.  My last submission was 41/41., Unresolved,2
