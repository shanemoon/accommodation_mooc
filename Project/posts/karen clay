Tuesday September 3rd 2013 7:31 pm -04:00,Im actually spending less time than estimated on the actual coursework but Im having problems with technical stuff like not submitting the a1 file on my desktop.  That I had to fiddle with in a different way that the instructions said to do.  ...but no worries rather having to delete my file on my desktop labeled a1 because when I browse prior to submit its the only one with the title...that is the empty one.  deleting it did the trick but it took me forever to figure out my problem.  At first I thought I lost all my work because it was back to its original state then I saw that the one in python was still there.I saved it within the Python/IDLE program and then deleted it from desktop.  I copy and pasted before trying it just in case.  I think the extra time helps me learn stuff.  Im liking it all even with the frustrations.  ,None,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 1:24 pm -04:00,I wish I knew that before I submitted roughly six times.  The auto message says something like check back in a few minutes for the feedback  so I figured my submission didnt go thru.  How long should we wait before assuming we submitted improperly or something?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:53 pm -04:00,I am unable to see if there is a problem with the autograder or whatever we are submitting to.  The only comments saying its not working are from students.  It would be nice to have that confirmed by an instructor or TA.  I submitted my finished product (which isnt really finished.  I just want to see the feedback to continue) around noon and its now nearly 10pm.  No result., Unresolved,0
