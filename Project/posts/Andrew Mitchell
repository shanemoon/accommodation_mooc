Monday August 19th 2013 4:38 am -04:00,Thanks everyone thanks for the suggestions so far.Ive reproduced the issue in the flash and html5 players on the latest versions of IE Chrome and Firefox.I know the problem did not stop me answering the question. However I expect that future questions will be more complex and the formatting error may cause a problem.Â , Resolved,2
