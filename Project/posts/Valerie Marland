Sunday August 25th 2013 5:49 pm -04:00,Im a little bit confused as I watch this video. To take the example of the video where you have the variable area which uses the variables base and height within it if the variables point to a memory address instead of a value then shouldnt it be true that the value of area updates when base or height change instead of it retaining the values of base and height when area was defined?It just seems counter intuitive to use variables in a situation like that if you have to redefine area if the used variables values change., Unresolved,1

I guess I just like knowing the why of these things (when possible) because knowing why someone might have chosen to design it that way is more likely to help me remember something that otherwise seems backwards to me. (And I like to think there is a good reason that just isnt occurring to me.), Unresolved,2
