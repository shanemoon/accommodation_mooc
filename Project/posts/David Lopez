Monday September 2nd 2013 8:21 pm -04:00,So i am upset about this Assignment. Here is why:I earned a score of 42/41. I found it all to be relatively straight forward and easy to figure out so long as you followed the instructions carefully and tested the functions you built. Truthfully i just tested until I got it right and then i moved on to the next one. I dont see how that helps me build my knowledge but im not complaining about that part.my problem is that on the last two function to and from the utc time zone my answers were coming out 1 hour behind then what i believe to have figured it to be against the clock on my computer. could this be because of daylight savings? im not sure. but im still concerned as to how i figured out the last code statement and why it was producing a time that was 1 hour behind what i expected it to be?im tempted to paste my code... i need real feed back on my work not this computer generated scoring system..., Unresolved,0
