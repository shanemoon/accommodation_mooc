Wednesday September 18th 2013 12:13 am -04:00,I am having trouble with questions 9 - 14. I dont understand why 55 is printed for number 10. In fact I dont understand for loops. I tried watching the video again but I just couldnt get it. For Example on number 10 this is what I got: >>> for digit in digits:	result = result - int(digit)	print(result)	55545249454034271910I dont understand why it starts with 55?? Also on number 9 I believe I have the right answer but I dont understand it. What does the +1 do in the following code?s1.find(s2 s1.find(s2)+1)Thanks, Unresolved,0
