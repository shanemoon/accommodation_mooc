Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:20 pm -04:00,I have been reading the recommended textbook and working along with IDLE as I read.On p93 no matter what I do I cannot get the code to run in IDLE.I first did copy and paste exactly as the text and got a SyntaxError.I then tried to indent as a block; SyntaxError.Then I tried to enter the next line outside of the block; SyntaxError.What am I missing here?As I look ahead in the reading I see that if and elif are used extensively in the next few pages and I just cant seem to get them to work.  Am I doing something wrong with indentation?The section of code on p94  with if statements works fine.It is as if my computer doesnt like elif!Please advise?Thanks!, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:46 pm -04:00,Nick:Tried your code and else: worked fine.Tried it with elif: and...SyntaxError., Resolved,0

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:58 pm -04:00,NickI think Ive got it.  Yes I missed the colon but it was the spacing that was throwing me off.In the book on p93 elif is aligned with the if statement and indented 4 spaces from the left margin.When I return the line and backspace to the leftas you did so that elif falls 4 spaces in front of the previous if it works!Tried the same on the sample code on p95 and it works as well with the elif flush to the left NOT indented as in the book.Going back to the text however I am still confused about how to indent (or NOT indent) the elif and else statements when nested.  The textbook shows the elif and else statements generally indented 4 spaces and aligned with the if statement.First of all is this a Windows vs Mac problem--indenting 4 spaces or not?Or is this a misprint in the text?And is there a rule somewhere about how to indent these consistently so that I dont have to repeat coding until I finally get it right?Thanks for your help.I was getting desperate!, Resolved,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:27 pm -04:00,I have come up with avowel_found = statement that gives me the correct answers to both of the given examples and others that I have tested.I still get an incorrect responseThis is a single line of code using a boolean operator.Surely there is more than one line of code that will give the right answer?Is the correct answer available anywhere so that I can see what the preferred code is?, Resolved,0

Thursday September 19th 2013 10:43 am -04:00,I am also confused about this line of codea[1] = a [1][0]I used IDLE to get an answer and have completed the assignment but I really dont understand this.According to the given code by step 3 we have:a = b = [1 ‘AB’ 3]Thena[1] = a[1][0]  Using braces to help me visualize:a[1] = {a[1] = ‘AB’}[0]a[1] = ‘AB’[0] According to the textbook and the notes for the Type list video:list[i:j] is a sliceof the original list from index i (inclusive)uptobut not including index j (exclusive).Python uses this convention to beconsistentwith the rule that the legal indices for a list go from 0 up to onelessthan the list’s length.Thefirst index can be omitted if we want toslice from the beginning of thelistand the last index can be omitted if wewant to slice to the end.But this code does NOT use [ : ] a colon--so are we slicing from the beginning A or the end B?Or are we not slicing at all and something else is going on?Please clarify.Thank you., Resolved,2
Thursday September 19th 2013 12:05 pm -04:00,I get it but dont get it.Please bear with me while I walk my way through this...a[1] = AB[0]AB is a string.Because strings are immutable it is only possible to use an expression of theform s[i] (string s at index i) on the right side of the assignment operator. (PracProg Sec 8.2)Which is where it is used in this code.Unfortunately the text does not go on to explain just what this means.So from our exampleAB[0] means the character A in position 0 in the string ABThat means:a[1] = Aand nowa = b = [1 A 3]Is that it?, Resolved,1
Thursday September 19th 2013 1:24 pm -04:00,I think I have worked my way through this now.Just one more question:Is this considered string slicing or is it using an index to identify an element of a string and then assigning that element to the index position of the list on the left side of the assignment statement?Or are they the same thing?  (I dont think so but I would like your reply.)Thanks for your patience., Resolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 4:34 pm -04:00,Thanks I think I get it.The text was not clear about this in Ch 8 and it definitely was not slicing code using the :I was confused by the term string slicing used in the post by Tom Enos of two days ago.In conclusion indexing and slicing  are two different but equivalent ways to get to the same result.Indexing requires one argument and brackets.  [ ]Slicing requires two arguments ( can be null) brackets and a colon. [ : ], Resolved,0

Wednesday September 18th 2013 11:18 am -04:00,I like to try out the code in IDLE as well asin the Python visualizer.I madethe mistake of going right to IDLE instead of the visualizer.Two ofthese options give infinite loops which the visualizer stops after 300iterations.IDLEdoes not!Mycomputer kept crashing when I would substitute the offending code into theprogram until I finally tried them in the visualizer which noted the infiniteloops and thankfully stopped WITHOUT crashing the computer., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 18th 2013 12:31 pm -04:00,I couldnt restart the shell because my mouse wouldnt work at all--had no way of clicking on  Shell -> Restart Shell. Hopefully wont need it but will remember the Ctrl+c solution.Making big note and posting it on the computer!, Resolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 7:24 am -04:00,Absolutely true with Windows 7.No response from either keyboard or mouse. I had both the IDLE window open where I was running the code and other windows as well (text in Adobe reader) Exercise 5 etc.None would respond.Tried Task Manager and couldnt even pull that up to close off anything.Finally resorted to the power button never a good way to turn off a computer.I did not try the Ctrl + C method recommended above because I am not going to deliberately put myself into an infinite loop again.I recommend saving your work as noted above and running the code in the Visualizer first if possible instead of directly into IDLE.The Visualizer returned an error message saying the loop was stopped after 300 iterations--more than enough to know this was bad code--but at least it kept processing and didnt freeze., Resolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 6:09 pm -04:00,Due to unexpected family obligations I am unable to complete weeks 6 and 7 (videos exercises assignments and final exam) until the end of October at the very earliest.Will I be able to submit the exercises etc for grading at that time or will the grading system be closed?I am not concerned about getting the certificate so much as I would like to complete the class.Or should I withdraw from the class and register for it (or something similar) at a later date?Thank you for a reply.,None,0
