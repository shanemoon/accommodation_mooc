Wednesday September 11th 2013 9:07 am -04:00,Look to avoid a indentation error the simplest way I feel that first write a line of instruction and then hit enter .if you are working in a python idle then it will automatically put you to correct indentation according to the last code youve entered .I hope this strategy will help you.if you want to try same in your code then first type the first line if temp < 0:and then as soon as you will hit enter you ll see the cursor at somewhere down below at temp thats the correct indenting of this code and what you did is you put the print just at start if statement which is actually a wrong indentation according to the rules .Good luck :), Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 8:54 am -04:00,First do not apply the random strategy to solve something because it will make it more messy and tough to resolve .further always try to start the assignments as soon as they get posted instead of starting it on the vary last day  I also did the same in first iteration of this class and lost the class badly due to this reason .now If it is saying that there is a syntax error then better read all the code line by line recall the professors instructions given in the lectures and then try to find out what is missing .sometimes its just indentation(means just wrong spacing between instructions) and otherwise its a syntax error.rest dont lost hope It might be possible that you are going all correct but just because of  a missing colon(:) or a missing parenthesis ((/)) you are getting this syntax error .and remember that you are a marine programmer WHO NEVER GIVE UP! OK .Good Luck :), Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 9:56 pm -04:00,@Leandro Have you hit the F5 key after saving your code in idle this is a common mistake people do because after saving you always need to run the module to see the results .Good luck :), Resolved,2

Wednesday September 11th 2013 9:54 am -04:00,Hey William !I found this thread https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1058where Professor Campbell stated this We just posted this announcement:Thanks to your feedback we realized that we were missing an Assignment 1 test case. We decided to add it but we didnt want to penalize anyone for our mistake. To address that we left the mark for Assignment 1 out of 41. It is now possible to get 42/41.so I feel that for your answers to be all correct towards all test cases assigned you need to get 42 rather 41 (as they updated a new test case perhaps) though it is not going to affect your score anyway as thats what she herself stated .I hope if you upload your file now then you might also get 42/41 according to the new test case assigned I mean this is what Ive got through this all!, Resolved,1
