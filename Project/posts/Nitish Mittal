Tuesday August 27th 2013 12:41 pm -04:00,Gregory at the moment it is better if the students focus on Python rather than the IDEs. So let us stick to IDLE at the moment please!Cheers!, Unresolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 2:29 pm -04:00,You just have to implement the function which returns what is mentioned in the docstring. You do not have to make the user enter the input., Unresolved,0

Sunday September 8th 2013 11:11 am -04:00,According to the documentationtrunc in Math module Truncates x to the nearest Integral toward 0.int : A floating point argument will be truncated towards zero.So these both are same except the fact that you can use strings with base in int. For numerals with fixed base 10 these both are same., Unresolved,1

Monday September 9th 2013 3:03 pm -04:00,Here are some of the points you might want to consider!    Unix-based OS                    Terminal is a bash shell with all the standard Unix utilities            Built-in SSH!!                        Comes preloaded with software that works great with Unix: SVN PHP Apache2 etc.            I find a Unix filesystem so much more comfortable to use in development.                Great UI - In my humble opinion you cant beat the usability of a Mac. I love the Mac-specific apps I use daily - Mail Adium Textmate    Great OS - Cant beat the install of (most) Applications - drag and drop. The /Library folder is well organized and easy to find what I need if I have to dig into preferences copy an applications support files install a new Preference        Pane. Speaking of System Preferences - another great feature of Mac.    Great support for other apps - IntelliJ IDEA is as good on a Mac as anywhere. Skype. Chrome. Firefox. Adobe suite.    Great hardwareI copied this from an article. Hope you like this. Cheers!,None,0
