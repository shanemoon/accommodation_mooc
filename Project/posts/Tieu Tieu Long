Sunday September 15th 2013 7:44 am -04:00,Dear guysI got a stuck when trying to test the Quiz attempt in week 4 video for loop over str (11:35)    ✐ Quiz AttemptedThe last quiz is Give the missing line (_____) that makes the following incomplete function correct:def has_vowel(s):    (str) -> bool     Return True if and only if s has at least one vowel not including y.    >>> has_vowel(Anniversary)    True    >>> has_vowel(xyz)    False        vowel_found = False    for char in s:        if char in aeiouAEIOU:            ______I tryed with  {vowel_found=vowel_found or  char}and then I tried{vowel_found= not(vowel_found)                      }All was wrong!!!And then I try to this in Python shell but when I type:def has_vowel(s):    (str) -> bool     Return True if and only if s has at least one vowel not including y.    >>> has_vowel(Anniversary)    True    >>> has_vowel(xyz)    False        vowel_found = False    for char in s:        if char in aeiouAEIOU:                vowel_found = not vowel_found    return vowel_foundand run this shell(after I Save it) a Syntax error dialogue box appeared: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation with a red bar right after vowel_found = not vowel_foundIt happen again and again!Could you do me a favor and explain it for me^^Thanks and best regard!,None,0
