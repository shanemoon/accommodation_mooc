So how much larger than -24 is -1? You do this by subtraction: -1 - (-24) = 23. This can be confusing because youre not using the absolute value of the numbers. It can help to visualize it on a number line:<-------(-24)----------------------(-1)--0----------------->-1 is 23 spaces to the right of -24 which is the answer that Python gives us.Lets try another example with negative numbers:-30%24the largest multiple of 24 that isnt higher than -30 is -48 so we can subtract -48 from -30 and that gives us 18to look on a number line -30 is 18 spaces to the right of -48 so the answer is 18.<------(-48)--------------------(-30)----------------->Using this method of calculation the Modulo function in Python will always return a positive integer between 0 and B-1, Unresolved,6
Tuesday September 17th 2013 2:02 am -04:00,Are we allowed to use len()? For some reason I thought we werent allowed to use it so I used my get_length function that I wrote which also didnt include len(). It would make my code a few lines shorter if we can., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 8:04 am -04:00,yeah it just seems odd if we can use the len function why do we even need the get_length() function? Unless its to use as a function in an object later on. At this point it seems a bit redundant., Unresolved,0

The programming assignments are much more complex than the ones here but theyre a lot of fun. By the end of the course you finish with making an Asteroids clone its pretty cool! Good luck!, Resolved,1
