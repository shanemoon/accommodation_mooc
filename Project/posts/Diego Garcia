Tuesday August 20th 2013 11:59 am -04:00,Hi I am afraid of install Python 3 because i work with ArcGIS that comes with python 2.7 so i am pretty scared of having troubles with this program if i finally install python 3. I don´t know nothing about programming so maybe this is silly but can i have 2 differents versions of python in the same computer?Thanks, Resolved,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 4:44 pm -04:00,HiAssigments are 10% ot the final score each one or just a 10% all the assigments together??? I am doing other courses and other things and i really don´t have time so if assigments are all together just a 10% i think is better for my don´t do them but if would be a problem for me if each assigment worths a 10% of the final score., Unresolved,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 5:37 pm -04:00,Sorry again what´s about that?:LTP1: assignment submission delayHi allWe have decided to relax the submission delay: you can now submit assignments as often as you like. However if the load on the server ends up slowing it down significantly we may add a delay.Cheers-Paul and JenI am not very sure that means that i can send the assigment no matter when and i still have credits for it?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 8:53 am -04:00,Hi everyoneFirst of all i am really sorry for writting my code but i really don´t know is the code works fine or not. It´s about the read_words function.my code is this:word_list = open(wordlist1.txt r)    lines = word_list.readlines()    for line in lines:        print(line end=)When i run the code i get a line (whiteout blank lines) for each word in the wordlist1 file. But i am not sure if i must get that or if i must get something like this: [word0 word1 word2 word3]So i just need a little bit of help to know if i am finally done with this function or if i need to keep working on it. Thanks, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 1:10 pm -04:00,HiI am finally done with this (or at least that what i though). I mean i have all my functions working fine (i have tested them) but when i try to run the a3_driver the programm starts but after typing the players names it goes directly to:Game Over    0    Player 1    0    Player 2I don´t see why and really need some help!, Unresolved,1
