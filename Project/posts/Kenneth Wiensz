Thursday August 29th 2013 3:38 pm -04:00,Would it be possible (without copyright infringement) to post the Exercise sets from the Python Text Practical Programming:... (which was written by Paul and Jennifer [and Jason Montojo]) just as practice problems?,None,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 3:57 am -04:00,since there are 3600 seconds per hour have you tested your function with 3610 7220 and 11000 seconds?you should get 1 2 3 hours...try those numbers...tomorrow I check for your response...also...check the number of quote marks your text appears to have 3 single quotes() on one side and 3 double quotes () on the other side of the text, Resolved,2
Monday September 2nd 2013 6:26 pm -04:00,The problem summary:  For the Question: Selecting the syntactically correct  if  statement(s).  Your Automatic grading system shows the top two answers to be the correct answers.  Yet in your notes for this section you state that each if statement should end with an else section  not an elif section.Steps to reproduce:Screenshot:, Resolved,1
Tuesday September 24th 2013 1:11 pm -04:00,According to the rules of the game the words should be seen as proceding from left to right or top to bottom but not backwards...yet you have listed the word box as being one of the acceptable words in the word list.  Not only is it backwards it is non-contiguous.  Given the acceptability of the word box what about words like TAN OAT BAN SAT and there are a lot more.Theobject of the game is for the players to view the board and find words(remember that the words list is unknown to the players). Words may becontained in rows (from left to right) or columns (from top to bottom) but notbackwards., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 1:13 pm -04:00,Also what about words that could be seen on the diagonal?, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 1:21 pm -04:00,In the downloaded files wordlist1.txt and board1.txt the word EAT is among the words in wordlist1.txt yet there is no T in board1.txt., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 2:01 pm -04:00,Having read the assignment it says no backwards words yet it listed BOX as an acceptable word.  Additionally you say and only look for words across and down yet the word list contains a word not seen in the list.  One could include the word puzzle in the word list since as you said not all words will be on the board., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 1:29 pm -04:00,Just for clarification...are you going to supply the LETTER BOARDS and the WORD LISTS and our programs are supposed to read both files then play the game with the players until they guess all the words (or quit because of frustration).  Or do we make up our own LETTER BOARDS and WORD LISTS?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 2:51 am -04:00,Using your example of player_info = [Jonathon4] I am able to update the players score WITHIN the function.  During the execution of the function >>>update_score([Jonathan 4] ANT) inside the function the player_info =  [Jonathon7] but after the function completes execution player_info = [Jonathon4]   .The Python documents state that local variables exist only within the function itself how do we (I) make changes to the player_info variable within the function that will remain valid outside the function., Unresolved,0
