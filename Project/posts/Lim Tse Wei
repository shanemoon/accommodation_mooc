Tuesday September 10th 2013 5:13 am -04:00,Hey guys! I was wondering if anyone found the functions description slightly confusing. In the Assignment 2 Guidance the get_hours function was described as such:get_hours:                    (int) -> intHowever the description then suggest that we use the to_24_hour_clock function which has an example that returns a float. Should we still be calling the to_24_hour_clock function in the get_hours function?, Resolved,0
