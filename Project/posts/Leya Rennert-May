Wednesday August 28th 2013 3:35 pm -04:00,I feel like a complete dunce as well. I have never done any programming before have gone over and over the lectures went through the exercise until I have all of the questions correct and am now totally lost again. Im on Step 2 isnt the function already filled out? I dont understand what were even supposed to be answering :(, Unresolved,2
Wednesday August 28th 2013 3:58 pm -04:00,Thanks Luis!I keep getting a typeerror with this code:return seconds_difference(time_2 - time_1) What am I doing wrong?, Unresolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 12:10 am -04:00,Got it!!!! Woohoo :) Thanks so much everyone! This really helped clarify some of the concepts for me.  , Unresolved,2
Thursday September 5th 2013 12:56 am -04:00,I can figure out this question just by looking at it by I dont understand how to solve the problem by plugging the problem into Idle :( Im concerned that as the problems get more difficult Im going to need to understand how to do this instead correctly of just relying on intuition. I put in:def dollars(num):    (num) -> num    if dollars == 8:        return True    else:        return False and I keep getting back typeerrors?? I feel like Im not not on the right track here. , Resolved,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 10:35 am -04:00,I have been futzing around with this for hours and am about ready to chuck my laptop out the window. With this code everything seems okay except that lowercase letters also come back as True.    for char in dna:        if char in ATCG:            return True                if char not in ATCG:            return FalseCan anyone help point me in the right direction? Thanks!, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 10:49 am -04:00,So for example if I run is_valid_sequence(AtcTGT) it returns True. But this should return False :S, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:08 am -04:00,I think Im getting further away....is_valid_sequence = 0    for char in dna:        if char in ATCG:            is_valid_sequence + 1            if is_valid_sequence == len(dna):        return True    else:        return False , Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 2:52 pm -04:00,I keep thinking Im onto something and then its all wrong. I think I might just be making up terms now...return insert_sequence.insert(len(dna1)dna2) Ive watched the splicing and indexing lecture over and over and I can follow it clearly but I cant seem to quite equate it to the assignment. , Resolved,0

Thursday September 12th 2013 3:22 am -04:00,I promise this is my last post. I understand the concept of the question and so far have:def get_complementary_sequence(dna):    (str) -> str     >>>get_complementary_sequence(CATTAC)    GTAATG    >>>get_complementary_sequence(ATCG)    TAGC        dna ==     for char in dna:        if char == A:            dna = dna + T        elif char == T:            dna = dna + A        elif char == C:            dna = dna + G        elif char == G:            dna = dna + C    return dnaBut this returns the original sequence plus the complement together. Im guessing this has something to do with the + maybe? But I cant figure out how to just get the complement section. , Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 3:30 am -04:00,It only returns  now ??, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 3:39 am -04:00,Im sorry Im not quite sure I followed that. :(Something like this:dna =     for get_complement in dna:        if get_complement in dna:            get_complementary_sequence = get_complementary_sequence + get_complement                return dnaThis runs with an error though so its obviously still incorrect. , Resolved,0
