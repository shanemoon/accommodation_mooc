I am getting this error wich I dont understand what it means. I am getting it two times end_column and middle_column.It works for me any try that I give to the code it matches or so I think:make_str_from_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]] 1)NS>>> make_str_from_column([[A N T T] [X S O B]] 2)TO>>> make_str_from_column([[A T T] [X S O B]] 1)TSMy code its extremely simple a for loop and a return straight away something similar to:for x in range(len(y)):           return something[0][column_index] + something[0][column_index]Thanks guys really dont know what its the matter., Resolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 12:05 pm -04:00,Yes I had it is working but this one its been 4 hours and I think my brain its just freezed with so many things I have tryed.Now I am guessing if this code needs a counter I have modified my code adding:i = 0and then inside the for loop i = i+1it doesnt work either i gets values 1 and 2I am going crazy with this....No idea at all... I am just spending and spending and I really know how it should be but I am making something wrong i = 0 doesnt work I put it inside of the loop to be i = i + 1 and it just doesnt work., Resolved,0

Thursday October 3rd 2013 6:00 pm -04:00,I am sorry not to help much lady I just can tell you that the answer was in another post. Honestly I got stocked so much and I decided to look at every post about the error. Finally I got the solution by following the instructions from one user based on the wrong code of another user., Resolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 2:29 am -04:00,If you have time could be wise to do it by yourself having seen all the videos then re-watch them now should take less and you only have to write the most important stuff shouldnt take more than 5-10 hours to make and would be a good study., Resolved,0
