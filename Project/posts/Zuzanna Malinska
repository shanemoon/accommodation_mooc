Saturday August 31st 2013 2:52 pm -04:00,I had the same doubt as Anonymous and at first I understood this sentence opposite: as all examples are full hours I thought I should use examples like one-and-half hour for time offset being always the whole number.But according to the note in Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone):Most of the time zones on land are offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by a whole number of hours (UTCâˆ’12 to UTC+14) but a few are offset by 30 or 45 minutes., Resolved,0
