Tuesday September 17th 2013 10:41 pm -04:00,Your score is computer based on how you did on the other assignments and exams. Hypothetically speaking you could bomb the exam but do really well on the other areas with all As and still pass the course though you would prob still need like a 30 or 40 or something. Try your best on the exam and then if you give your best effort and do not pass the class I am sure next time you take the course  you can Pass. :-) I hope what I said makes sense. Let me know if it does not. , Resolved,1
