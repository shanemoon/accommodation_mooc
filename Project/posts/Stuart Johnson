Wednesday October 2nd 2013 4:04 pm -04:00,For some reason I can not get my print request to be accepted. No matter how I try to enter it I get in indent error.after line = test2.readline() the cursor is returned to the same indent as that line. This causes it to print wrong but I cant get it over to match the while line.I feel the read function and how to use it is very important. As a result of tracing errors like this I am at a stand still and doubt if I will complete the assignments exercises and final prior to the hard deadlines. On the plus side I can at least get files to open now., Unresolved,0
