Friday August 30th 2013 6:55 am -04:00,I have completed and submitted my assignment and my grades are yet to come. So just want to know if it is auto graded or manual. My thought is probably auto grading since the staff wont have time to look at individual assignments......., Unresolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 9:00 am -04:00,I have submitted my assignment and it has not been graded yet. Being automatic grading how come mine is not graded yet? is there anybody facing same problem as me? I submitted my coding as same as the a1.py file and all of my coding is tested and works properly (for the first time). , Resolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 11:33 am -04:00,Hi Hope you got the idea. what I did was converting the 24 hours to seconds. So any hours inputted in my code will be converted to seconds using the logic 1 hour =3600 seconds and since there are only 60 seconds you can modulo the result by 60 you get it in the range 0 to 59. same goes for the minutes but 1 hour = 60min. My coding does work properly in python. But they have graded it wrong and says it doesnt work. So i need to prove them it works perfectly.  , Resolved,1

Friday August 30th 2013 11:12 am -04:00,I have got my grading done and it is 29/41. It says failure in the to get_hoursget_minutesget_seconds.. But when I test it the coding actually produces the results. For eg. i used the value 2.7525. It gave me hours as 2minutes as 45 and seconds as 9..Give me some more examples to check if I am wrong or the grading is? Thank you., Unresolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 11:23 am -04:00,Hi Joanne The value I am inputting is in hours and it is converting into hours minutes seconds. So when inputted 2.7525 hrs it should give me 2 hrs 45 mins and 9 seconds. If it gave me 0 hrs 0 mins and 2.7525 seconds then the coding logic is wrong. , Unresolved,0
