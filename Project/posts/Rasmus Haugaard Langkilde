Wednesday September 4th 2013 8:52 am -04:00,This is basically answered in the other tread (https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1232)It comes down to what is a stack frame. I will quote Martin Šiňanský from the other tread:As Paul already mentioned frames have a thin grey line on their left one continuous line over several items still means you have these items in one frame... and since the main program counts as a frame the answer should be quite simpleYou need to run the visualizer to the step shown and then count the stack frames. I went back to Pauls first lecture from week 3 to figure out what a stack frame is. The answer should just be a number (this may be obvious but I had a lot of doubts before I submitted), Unresolved,4

Monday September 30th 2013 7:36 am -04:00,Have you not run it in Idle? I figured it might be a problem with parentheses or quotes that courses the whole thing to fail., Resolved,0
