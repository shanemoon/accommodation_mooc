Monday September 16th 2013 7:56 am -04:00,Method Description:Have you tested your function on a zero-length sequence?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorError!!! Not a valid DNA sequence != - Error!!! Not a valid DNA sequence+  : Have you tested your function on a zero-length sequence?Does the assigments description mentions anywhere that zero length sequences are valid sequences?My code tests against invalid sequences including zero length sequences and returns an error message. I got the same failure message for function is_valid_sequence using the same approach., Resolved,0

Monday September 16th 2013 8:20 am -04:00,I dont complain about the marks 22/24 is good enough for me. Its just the designing approach. I think that in a real life programm an empty DNA sequence should be invalid. Thanks anyway, Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 1:14 pm -04:00,I agree that we are beginning python students and many of us are not native english speakers. So i expect a more clarified description. To your opinion the assignment never said to treat zero length strings as errors tmo it doesnt say the opposite., Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 6:17 am -04:00,It wasnt clear to me either if the extreme left position must be denoted as 0. I think that it must be clearly stated at the description that valid indexes are in range 0 to n where n is the last nucleotides index. I wrote my code with this assumption but i wasnt sure about it till i saw this post., Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 7:07 am -04:00,Yeap ur right. I am just used to C++ or C# that index the first character as 0 not the left edge. , Unresolved,0
