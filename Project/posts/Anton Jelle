Saturday September 7th 2013 3:07 pm -04:00,Hi I have never used python before but i am familiar with c c++ c# and a few other programs. Im taking this cours with my Girlfriend as she would like to know some basic programming and i would like to brush up on my skills and in the process it is nice to learn a new languasge.My question or objection is the following:in your code you write (float float) -> str. and as long as your input are in that format it will work fine.But as long as the arguments are the same type your defenition will return a string( I only tested with strings i dont know if other types will result in an error)so you can write >>> report_status(hello hi) and it will return a string ( delayed).I can under stand why you dont want to check if the argument are the correct type or why you dont want to consider the date of the flights as it would just expand the code with out really clarifying anything.But you are teaching people the basics of code and you use the else to return a expected response. I think it should have been:def report_status(scheduled_time estimated_time):     (float float) -> str    Return the flight status (on time early delayed) for a flight that was    scheduled to arrive at scheduled_timed but is now estimated to arrive    at estimated_time.    Pre-condition: 0.0 <= scheduled_time < 24.0 and 0.0 <= estimated_time < 24.0    >>> report_status(14.3 14.3)    on_time    >>> report_status(12.5 11.5)    early    >>> report_status(9.0 9.5)    delayed        if scheduled_time == estimated_time:        return on time    elif scheduled_time > estimated_time:          return early    elif scheduled_time < estimated_time:          return delayedAnd you should have reserved the else to a catchall or somthing like that. I mean somthing like that can stick with peoples way of writing code.Or is there another reason you chose to use else that i havent considered.RegardsAntonP.S I dont know if this is in the right forumso feel free to move it to the propper.  :), Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 8:39 am -04:00,Can you executeif 18 < temp and temp < 26:print(A comfortable temperature)print(Lets go for a swim)?I cant. It needs indentations.so both are wrong., Unresolved,0
