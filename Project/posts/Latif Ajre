Tuesday September 10th 2013 11:21 pm -04:00,Im getting more confused on this way when i try to convert on hours is ok and second is ok but the problem is on get_minutes return to_24_hour_clock(seconds//60) why this if i do this one seconds//3600 is giving me the hour on second now seconds//60 i think should be ok for minutes couse 1min = 60 sec 1hr=3600 sec thats why i go in this way..... any help???, Resolved,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 11:39 pm -04:00,get_hours is ok and get_seconds the only problem is with get_minutes i try many ways but i dont know what to do im tired im stuck in this place for hours maybe more than 6 hours im working on one thing....  i really dont have idea i did the thing that im thinking return hours//60 cause hours//3600 is the hours and logicelly hours//60 need to be minutes but its not working :(, Resolved,0
