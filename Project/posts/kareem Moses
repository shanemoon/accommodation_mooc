Sunday August 18th 2013 9:37 pm -04:00,Hello all Im Kareem from Egypt Im a preparatory  Engineering student electrical engineering I dont know how programming is related to electrical engineering but i think what made me join the course isnt how the relation between them but I like the idea that we must learn how to program to know how computers work then we can control it.I know it wont be easy but I think that I can do many things by programming and may be in the future I can program a car Robot and many nice stuff And you whats your lifelong or short term goal from programming.Good luck my friendsKareem,None,6
