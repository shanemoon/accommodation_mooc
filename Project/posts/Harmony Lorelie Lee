Wednesday August 21st 2013 7:46 am -04:00,O.C. Huh?  My name is Harmony & I live in Sylmar CA which is in the Northeast part of the city of Los Angeles.....Im from San Diego California but have been an Angeleno for over 10 years now.  I have never programmed before & just thought I should learn it.  I have my Masters  degree already but am still waiting to get my doctorate.  Id like to teach online or have hybrid classes.  I have a certificate in using one type of online class software but I think I want to create classes from scratch even the program/software itself.,None,0

Saturday September 14th 2013 2:07 am -04:00,I got the results in IDLE for the first 2 steps finally but when I typed it into a1.py it did nothing out of time I saved it a few different ways & submitted at least what little I had but my points show nothing.......this concerns me not only about finishing this class (at least having a chance to succeed in this endeavor) but if I am submitting incorrectly or there is a bug in the system I am not going to be able to do the other assignments & or I am going to spend too much time on submitting & not enough on the assignment itself......., Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 8:20 am -04:00,I have less then 24 hours to complete this we have to get 70% for each exercise & assignment.  It is over I have tried everything.  I have typed all possible return seconds_difference ( ) I can think of w/ nothing but syntax errors to show for it.  Either I am just not getting it or I am missing a step either way in a little over 24 hours I will drop this class because I cannot get this time assignment.  I have read all the discussion group posts over & over again.....the new instructions are like code (pardon the pun) to me.  I cannot watch the videos again w/out screaming.....I just fail!  This is very sad & frustrating.  , Resolved,3
Wednesday September 11th 2013 1:53 am -04:00,I have nothing so far.  I cannot get pass Step 2.  Okay I have the a1.py open & I try to write a return statement as instructed.  I put in return seconds_difference (3600.0 1800.0) & then go to RUN => Run Module.....I copy & paste into the newly opened shell & hit enter.....I get SyntaxError: invalid syntax  I have tried a zillion different combinations.  What am I missing?, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 8:21 pm -04:00,I never got the question 14 on the exercise either.  I thought we are just writing code not solving Mathematical equations.....I try to write a return statement using the same format from the videos & all I get is syntax errors.....I am missing something.  I have tried walking away but now I am out of time.  If I do not get the part I am missing it will be over.  Thank u all for your responses.  , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 8:46 pm -04:00,It sounds exactly like what is happening to me.  The instructions are soooooooo vague that I think I am missing something BIG!  So many of the post say it is really simple but that doesnt help if we are missing a step or not getting what the format really is...... all I get is this    return (seconds_difference 3600.0 1800.0)SyntaxError: invalid syntaxNo matter how many times I write this return statement in whatever order w/  w/out ( ) :  or not I get the same thing  I am missing a step but it is beyond me what it could be......I am out of time to find it.  BUT Kay I will hang till the very end w/ u it is only a few hours away anyway., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 2:30 am -04:00,NO I havent fixed anything.....I am trying starting to think it is all in the steps the instructions that I am not getting.  I have been looking at all the suggestions from my super nice fellow students & it all still looks confusing.......I open the a1.py then what??????, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:42 pm -04:00,I hate (but am also comforted) that I am not alone.  I have an MA in Social Sciences.  I cried all day the first C I got for my undergrad degree.....this is not beginners.  I am signed up for another that states building basic games etc....that sounds like programming this is teetering on algorithms & such.  I am not even near there yet.  I too have above average computer skills but not in the programming area yet.  I took this course because ironically I wish to teach online or have hybrid classes.  I received a certificate in online teaching for JC but that is their software.  I wanted to either build my own from scratch or at least be able to tweak & fix the bugs in the software.  So far this class has not shown me anything remotely in that direction......I know u must crawl before running but I cannot even move further in this class.  The time is an issue if I have no chance at the 70% on this assignment I cannot justify the time.  It saddens me greatly when it comes to education I am not a quitter except if its not quit what I thought. , Resolved,1

Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:57 am -04:00,I am starting to think that I am missing a step an instruction on how to do this......then It is the coding itself.  I open a1.py then type in something like return (seconds_difference(3600.0 1800.0))  then I copied & pasted into the shell that comes up after I went to Run -> Run Module  then I hit enter....up comes sytaxerror everytime..............., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 4:25 am -04:00,I put in JUST the seconds_difference(3600.0 1800.0) & got a whole page of  File C:\Users\sdpdk_000\Downloads\a1.py line 16 in seconds_difference    seconds_difference(3600.0 1800.0)RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded and it ended w/ the line above, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 4:57 am -04:00,Now I am really confused......I am not getting what to type in & where & what to copy & paste.....I have been given sooooooooooooo many suggestions that my head is spinning.  I appreciate the help VERY much but the light is just not coming on.  I am told just type in seconds_difference (3600.0 1800.0)  then I get a whole page of errors.  I am told to type in sec=30 & min=sec 30 & return minutes or return seconds/60. I get that 30 is an error.  I dont get the math part & I am good at math I am a bookkeeper right now.  I am lost on what to type where & what to copy in for what???????  I am going to take a very quick shower.  Many have said to take a break & so I will but if I dont get at least the first part of this done in the next couple of hours I have to quit....... )-:  & I dont want to quit, Resolved,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:47 am -04:00,I finally got it I got the -1800 but I tried uploading the a1.py to submit & I dont think its right.  One I tried the function call I finally got & the return statement in the shell after using the run module but when I tried typing it into the a1.py I had to type it all out.....is that correct?  or is it supposed to run like the shell?  OR am I supposed to copy it or ALL of that section into a shell & save/submit that.  I know I am not going to make the 70% to get a certificate I am just out of time.  BUT Id like to try & get something so maybe I will think of continuing.......HELP!, Resolved,0

Friday September 13th 2013 7:36 am -04:00,U dont need to explain yourself to someone.  One there seem to be quit a few of us that are having troubles some personal & some cuz there are bugs in the system (ones like me that are having both).......It is hard to learn when Im frustrated.  It would be nice to know where I went wrong before the next assignment & it is extremely imperative that we know the correct info before the final or we are all doomed......, Unresolved,-2
Sunday September 15th 2013 4:00 am -04:00,To whomever thought I was disrespecting someone it is just the opposite....I thought an earlier comment was a little assaulting to all of us that are struggling & I was saying that no one has to explain themselves to anyone else.....

Friday September 13th 2013 10:59 am -04:00,For those of us that struggled w/ the Assignment I feel if we do not get a corrected version released we are doomed to the end......especially for the final exam.  I know this because I had an issue w/ one question particularly on exercise 2 & I would bet money that it was where I struggled on the assignment as well.......so this lack of corrected material leaves us stuck w/ incorrect information or not learning that part of the material at all.  This is especially bad because this seems to be a build upon class w/ progressive steps in the subject.  Just my thoughts., Unresolved,1
