Friday August 23rd 2013 1:16 pm -04:00,well my friend. its not easy as it seem to be a good programmer. it depends on your creativity skills hard work and courage. i believe if you wanna be a (good)  game designer start with fundamentals.  such as flow chats and pseudo codes .then learn programming methodologies .then only you can move in to learn programming in proper way. it does not matter whenever you learn C# or C++ or Java or python. just learn it well and deep.do  exercises always .thats the basics ,None,1
