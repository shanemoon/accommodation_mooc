Friday September 13th 2013 1:49 am -04:00,Hello to all One of the practices to have an effective teaching is using questioning and discussion techniques be used as techniques to deepen student understanding.  Good teachers use questions created in such way that intrigue students to make hypotheses connection between their previous ideas. In satisfactory level of this component :Students start questions.The teacher uses students answers to deepen student understanding.Students enrich the discussion.Students invite their classmates to challenge them.All students engaged in the discussion virtually .I believe Coursera can achieve these items to some extent. For example discussion forum which able students to formulate questions and participate.please say your idea about it by clicking this link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dgZKcT7adWhbhb3maiphhXDrihEd6rbEztjtTIWhivo/viewformThanks,None,1
