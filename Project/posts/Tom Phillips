If by chance that you dont you should use your package manager to download it. In Ubuntu and Linux Mint you can use the terminal command: sudo apt-get install python3 to download Python. Though on those distributions Python should be pre-installed.An easy way to test whether you already have Python is to open the terminal and type: python3 then press enter. Try out some basic math the same way that was shown in the math video. If it works you have python installed.,None,0

This is the syntax:def area_per(baseheightside2side3):        return base * height /2 base + side2 + side3There are functions where it is necessary to have more than one return statement (ie when using if elif and else) but this isnt one of them.Â Also there is an issue with your parameter names. You have side1 and side2 as parameters but refer to a variable side3 in the body of the function. Anyway I hope this helped :), Resolved,2
