Monday August 26th 2013 10:19 pm -04:00,Greetings students professors and TAsI have a curious question regarding restricting a parameter value to some arbitrary type in python.I know the docstring examples may differ from the shell output as stated in the assignment sheet. I understand that performing operations with twoÂ  ints outputs an int valuebut what if we want to convert an int user input into a parameter into a float while performing an operation within the body? What i hope to achieve is to be able to control parameter inputs sort of like field validation features similar to database applications like MS Access, Resolved,0

The syntax is searchable through google and you can read it there. Students or instructors are not really obligated to give you the answer since the hard deadline hasnt even passed. What would be the point of solving problems (which is the point of programming really) if you know you dont even have to try hard the instant you are stumped?The boards are here for direction or validation if you are on the right path. You are welcome to try several methods in your own time in the IDLE gui to figure out what works and what doesnt. If you need someone to clarify the question im sure everyone here is willing to do that, Unresolved Locked,1
