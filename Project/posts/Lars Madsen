Sunday September 15th 2013 9:16 am -04:00,When i try my program i get back:TypeError: slice indices must be integers or None or have an __index__ methodI get that i need to put in an int. but writing the return statement so it picks up the int in insert_sequence is my big issue. Been watching the video str: indexing and slicing over and over again and i get the last part and looking through forum for the answers but just don`t know how to make use of the int i have to work with., Resolved,1
Sunday September 15th 2013 9:49 am -04:00,yeah i know what i have to do just not how to do it. The 1st - original seq from 0 to index. How to put it up so it uses the index given by the int., Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 11:06 am -04:00,yes that is what i have been trying to do but i just get: TypeError: slice indices must be integers or None or have an __index__ method.def insert_sequence(dna1 dna2 index):        (str str int) -> str      Return complete DNA sequence by inserting dna2 inside dna1 at the given index.         >>> insert_sequence(CTAAGT CCG 2)      CTCCGAAGT      >>> insert_sequence(ACT AAA 0)      AAAACT      >>> insert_sequence(TTAGCTCC GGG -4)      TTAGCGGGTCC            return , Resolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 1:17 pm -04:00,I did what you guys mentioned to Brian and get the error: File C:\Python33\Doc\makestrfromrow.py line 20 in make_str_from_row    column_string = column_string + row[column_index]NameError: global name column_index is not definedwhy is that? , Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 9:52 am -04:00,It keeps giving me True even though i change the board characters so i guess its using the word. How am i making it only check board characters?valid_match = False    for row_index in range(len(board)):        if word in (board word):            valid_match = True    return valid_match, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 10:23 am -04:00,sorry maybe it`s just me being stuppied but getting the error: make_str_from_row is not defined when using the one from a3.py. Do i have to import the earlier work or did i miss something completley?, Resolved,0
