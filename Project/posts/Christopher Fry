Monday September 2nd 2013 1:05 am -04:00,I am quite honestly stumped on this one.Ive tried a few things did some math but I cant get all the examples correct at once. I think I have to use thereturn (seconds_difference)somewhere but... When I do try it even if I do something like try to multiply it with a number (is that possible?) I get TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: function and int and it just doesnt work with anything I try to do with it in general. , Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 3:33 am -04:00,I got that much down the first question (seconds) was easy but I cant seem to figure out how to get how to tell it to figure out how many hours are in between time_1 and time_2 for hours_difference.I do understand the concept of function and expression maybe Im just bad at math.I also thought that I might have to include seconds_difference into it but as Jose said I know it shouldnt be after return but I couldnt think of where else to put it., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 4:23 am -04:00,I got it now. Thank you. It mostly boils down to me having been dead tired at the time of working on this assignment and not realizing it wasnt absolutely due this Monday (yesterday) but next Monday. Long story short I was trying too hard to make it much more complicated than it actually is until Laurentiu pointed out that the input is only seconds., Resolved,2
