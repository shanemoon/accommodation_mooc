Friday August 30th 2013 4:55 am -04:00,I was doing an exercise in How to Think Like a Computer Scientist( Python) based on Python 2 and wanted to print on screen a 7 x7 array of numbers based on the times  table ie first line 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 second line 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 third line 3 6 9 12 15  18 21 and so on. ( using the for statement) I cannot get the print statement to print numbers across the page I tried using  but this does not seem to work in Python 3 then tried using the sep  command and also the comma again to no avail.Has anyone any guidance please?Also we can use the print function  to print to screen but how do we print to an external printer using Python?!Gary,None,0
Friday August 30th 2013 3:40 pm -04:00,Hi JonnyThanks for that. I amended your code slightly as follows:def table(n):    my_str =     for i in range(1n+1):        for j in range(1n+1):            my_str += str(i*j) +         my_str +=     print(my_str)Save this as a program and then call table(n) for the n times table. It works well!As to how this works I am not sure on the following:my_str= .....what is the  doing?my_str+=str(i*j) +  ...what is going on here?( are we converting i*j to a string and if so why do we need to do this?)my_str+ = ....what is this doing?RegardsGary,None,0

Saturday August 31st 2013 5:17 pm -04:00,The module pygame is useful for writing games. However I am having some difficulty in downloading it. First there are umpteen versions of pygame so I selected the latest. I then tried to download it but the program still comes up with the error message pygame not installed or words to that effect. Perhaps I have downloaded it to the wrong place?Has any one any ideas on this please?Incidentally I also tried to import the standard random module also unsuccessfully so hopefully the answer to the first part will also apply to random and other library modules.Gary,None,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 5:33 pm -04:00,Hi Thanks. What about the pygame module which is not a standard Python module? I am using 3.2Gary,None,0

Friday September 6th 2013 3:03 pm -04:00,HiOne of the slight problems of python  as I understand it is working with matrices.......you basically have to divide data into a number of lists to construct the matrix.My problem or one of them is that I have a  large sequence of numbers arranged into about 30 numbers  ( 0-9) on each line without spaces and I wish to analyse this data. I can divide data into lists of say 30 numbers but this means putting commas between each number and [ ] round each group of numberswhich is a lot of work for large amounts of data.I can also convert the number into a string ( not without difficulty as there is white space at the end of each line of numbers and I get an EOL error message if I try to simply convert all the numbers into a string by putting  a the beginning and end of the data) call the string say var and using int (var[i]) identify each number within its place in the string. Again I could also set up an array and read each number into the array from the string( probably after converting to an inter integer). Has any one any better ideas eg using one of the libraries?Gary,None,0
Friday September 6th 2013 6:17 pm -04:00,HI All Thank you for the advice which has given me some new ideas. The problem arose when i was attempting some of the questions on Project Euler.I cant discuss specifics per the rules of that Project  but I can certainly recommend the Project for combining maths and learning computer programming.RegardsGary,None,1
