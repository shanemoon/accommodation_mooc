Sunday September 22nd 2013 12:01 am -04:00,Same here. I get 9 out of 24 my first assignment was 42 and one exercise was missing 6 points and I missed the deadline for another one. Now Im afraid the technical problem causes me to fail this course! My code of the 2nd assignment works perfectly.I tested all possible inputs., Resolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 4:37 am -04:00,One problem solved: I had to use return not print! Thats in the Q&A I shouldve read it first., Resolved,1
Sunday September 22nd 2013 12:26 am -04:00,I was able to fix my code there to get the one score but I still dont get the philosophy behind it: WHY would we want to return True for an empty string? Im imagining a machine that tests molecules and when I input nothing it thinks its a VALID DNA???Isnt it much better to return None meaning nothing?, Unresolved,1
