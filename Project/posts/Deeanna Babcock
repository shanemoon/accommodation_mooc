Monday September 2nd 2013 1:59 am -04:00,It wouldnt happen to take an early start would it?I always get anxious thinking Im too late to the game to go into a career of programming given that I have no prior experience and am already in college. Is it possible to play catch-up and become a Computer Science major?,None,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 1:52 am -04:00,I have a question: what language is recommended for someone going into the field of game programming?I plan on majoring in Computer Science just to broaden career opportunities but my ultimate goal is programming games and Im wondering what languages should I familiarize myself with if thats my endgame?,None,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:06 am -04:00,Console gaming is more what Im going for and C++ was a language I planned on working up to (with Java being somewhere along the way) because Ive been told that its pretty complex to immediately jump into. Thanks for the comprehensive answer!,None,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 8:48 am -04:00,Nicholaus from the sounds of it it seems like youre downloading a1.py immediately running it and then inputting seconds_difference(1800.0 3600.0); it wont yield any results until you program a return into the starter code for the assignment., Resolved,2
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:15 am -04:00,Can you be a bit more specific? Are you unable to download the handout or cannot view the instructions?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:43 am -04:00,Im not really sure why you cant see the link but lets see if you can access it through this.Ill leave this up just in case but as Paul said its probably a matter of confusing Assignment 1 under Week 2 with Assignment 2., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:56 am -04:00,No problem but I wouldnt have even thought to mention that if it werent for Paul; everyones just helping out however we can., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 8:08 am -04:00,As you can see from the title and screen cap Im having issues with this error; its on the categories for each of my answers and I dont understand why because Ive run every example on IDLE and theyve all come back correctly.Is there something Im missing?, Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 8:30 am -04:00,I appreciate the quick response but I realized my mistake was carelessness:I submitted the starter code not realizing I saved all changes elsewhere. Sorry for the false alarm. My score went from 0.0/41.0 to 42.0/41.0 so Im all set; I need to pay attention to what Im submitting in the future., Resolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:12 am -04:00,I definitely wouldnt by-pass the triple quotations just because its best to follow the examples shown when just starting out. (I tried to deviate from the sample codes by adding:round(... 1)at some point but it didnt work out so well even if it did work when I tried it out myself so just follow the examples from the previous questions to write the functions as Uddyalok said and you should be good., Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:19 am -04:00,True Im so tired that I forget the due date is coming up even if its not the hard deadline (although with that said its best not to give yourself undue stress Yaqzaan as you have until the 9th).I wasnt sure if not including them would dock points though so I decided better to be safe than sorry though if it doesnt interfere then it would save a little time., Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 10:05 am -04:00,Have you been answering in the shell window? If so that wont work: you need to apply your changes to the a1.py file and save that then run module to test it.Also review the examples you were given in the file because they make excellent reference for the framework you need when you make your own functions for for_hours for_minutes and for_seconds. If you have Syntax errors it means youre inputting the functions incorrectly somewhere which you can check by again referring to the examples in a1.py and testing your functions when youre done.And I cant stress this enough but this assignment isnt due until the 9th so reviewing can be the difference between stressing out or easing your way to a perfect score., Unresolved,0
