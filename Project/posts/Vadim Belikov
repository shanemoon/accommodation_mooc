Ill give you an algorithm for getting num_words on board to work properly:def num_words_on_board(board words):    1. Create a variable word_count and assign it to zero.    2. Create a for loop which will generate indexes of every word in words. (for i in range(len(words)))    3. Make decision with if (using functions:  board_contains_word_in_column and  board_contains_word_in_row):            if board_contains_word_in_column(board words[index of a word]) or board_contains_word_in_row(board words[index of a word]):    4. If an if statement evaluates to True:   word_count += 1    5. return word_count, Unresolved,0
