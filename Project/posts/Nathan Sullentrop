Wednesday September 4th 2013 1:05 am -04:00,It gave me a spot for Screen caps so I used them not thinking of it. I knew it was a violation I just wasnt sure if it applied while posting about bugs.Isnt the check mark supposed to indicate the correct answer?I marked 2 different answers each time and it gave me 50% so what is happening is there is actually no wrong answer for that question?  I mean when I do it in Idle I seem to get an error for 2 of the answers., Resolved,0
