Friday August 30th 2013 4:45 pm -04:00,Issue is that for Strings or in general programming you must close any qoutes which you started for example if you started to write single qoute() you must type another one to close it. In your case since you have started the triple qoute() you must first close it:-so you must do as below on the commandline change:->>>def perimeter(side1 side2 side3):         (number number number) -> number          Return the perimeter of a triangle with side of length           side1 side2 and side 3.to def perimeter(side1 side2 side3):         (number number number) -> number          Return the perimeter of a triangle with side of length           side1 side2 and side 3. Note that you must close the triple qoute.Also since every function must return some value so you must type a return statement and then press Enter twice you will see the >>> to start your test., Unresolved,2

Thursday September 5th 2013 5:42 pm -04:00,The math module has a function that returns the factorial of a number. Assuming that the math module has already been imported write an expression that calls the factorial function from math to find the factorial of 8.Hint: In IDLE import math and then use dir and help on the math module to determine the name of the function that you need to useThe question is asking us to import the math module so that we have access to all the function in math module.Question also tells us to find what does factorial does by using help(math.factorial)Then use factorial to find the factorial of 8.Hope this helps :), Resolved,1
Thursday September 5th 2013 5:43 pm -04:00,The problem summary:issue is even if i do not attempt a question since it is a multiple choice question and 1 marks is divided into 4 parts .25 each so the grader gave me .75 marks. i think this should be resolved :)Steps to reproduce:do not answer question 13 and you will still get .75 Screenshot:i have the image or you can check in my attemp for the Week 3 Exercise, Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 4:04 pm -04:00,Thanks Kevin.but i wish the grading to be more precise.Another thing which i noticed is that we can see our last attemp which also shows right answers.This leads to a lazy approach that we may just look at the last attemp and do not try to think much hope this could be resolved.i am ready to help If you think i can help with something :), Resolved,0
