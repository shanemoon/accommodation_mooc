Sunday August 18th 2013 10:35 pm -04:00,Hi! Are you having problems with the IDLE editor that comes with Python? If IDLE doesnt work Notepad++ as suggested by Anton will work but there will be some differences that youll need to be aware of (unfortunately not being a Windows user I dont know what those differences are)., Resolved,1
Sunday August 18th 2013 10:39 pm -04:00,Anton is exactly right. Youll definitely want Python 3 since Python 2 differs in subtle but important ways., Resolved,1
Sunday August 18th 2013 11:53 pm -04:00,Sounds like youre doing all the right things (trying both versions of the installer and trying a different browser)!If youre having problems with the version 3.3.2 installation file the version 3.2.5 installation file at http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2.5/ might work. Or you might have better luck with 3.0.1 http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0.1/ which was released before Windows 8 so it might be better tested with Windows 7. All the material we cover in this course should be equally applicable to all Python 3.x so as long as you stay away from Python 1 and Python 2 youll be fine. Let us know if youre still having problems!, Resolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 12:33 pm -04:00,Automatic grader feedbackI have a SyntaxError. What does that mean?A Error: SyntaxError occurs when a program does not follow Pythons grammar (syntax). For example an if statement missing a colon at the end of the line is a problem. If you get this error we were unable to run any tests on your code. To fix this error make sure you run your program before submitting and deal with all the error messages from Python.I have a Failure: AssertionError . What does that mean?This means that your function when called with certain input returned the incorrect answer. To reduce the likelihood of this error make sure to test each of your functions carefully with your own input., Pinned Unresolved Locked,2
Sunday September 1st 2013 9:46 am -04:00,Exactly right about the precondition not being checked by Python. Just because a precondition is included doesnt mean a function wont behave in a reasonable way for input that doesnt meet the preconditions. We didnt want you worrying about how certain operations in Python behave with negative numbers when it came to us running our test cases. If you dont want to call your function with a negative number you can easily change the inputs to your function -- note that shifting by -1 hour is the same as shifting by 23 hours (or by 47 hours)., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 10:46 am -04:00,(The following is just a for-fun explanation)The mathematical operator modulo can be either negative OR positive for negative numbers. For example it is correct to say that -11 modulo 10 is both -1 or 9 (-11 is either -2 * 10 with 9 left over or -1 * 10 with -1 left over). For some purposes its more convenient to have a negative number and for others a positive number. Different programming languages have settled on different ways of treating negative numbers; Python has chosen the always-positive route., Unresolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 9:23 pm -04:00,Just in case there was any confusion the marking system only checks to see if each function behaves as specified in the assignment handout; its actually possible to submit terrible code that will pass the tests. The system only checks for functional correctness. In the classes we teach in person we do some automated marking and usually the code that passes is pretty good. Every once in a while though someone submits a solution that passes that is either utterly brilliant or very baffling. Last term I got a 100-line solution for a function that calculated what century a given year was in., Unresolved,2

Monday September 2nd 2013 11:17 pm -04:00,Hi DanielIn addition to the example inputs we test your code against other (secret) inputs. The examples are just that -- examples -- to show other programmers how to call the function and to help clarify some common situations. However the text description of the function is also important. You should definitely keep trying assignment 1 until you get 42/41.

Tuesday September 17th 2013 4:26 pm -04:00,If you write the functiondef print_x():    print(x)And call the function in a fresh shell you will get an error because x is not defined either inside the function or outside.

Tuesday October 1st 2013 12:41 pm -04:00,Hi RodrigoIm sorry the exercises and assignments have been confusing. We do spend hours in groups slaving over small changes in wording (in case you thought we just slapped things together). What part of the docstring did you find confusing that the other docstring clarified (in this particular instance)? The main difference I see is that the description of the board appears in the docstring. In this instance we wouldnt change the docstring; what constitutes a board appears at the top of the file and it would be extremely odd to repeat the same information in every single docstring that a board is referenced (also what happens if the specification of the board changes? Thats a lot of hunting through code to make a change). If the problem was that the description of a board at the top of the file did not specifically mention single characters this is something we could do to improve our docstring.As for the example because theres file input/output involved we dont write examples for it (as per the function design recipe). This has to do with limitations of doctesting (if youve encountered this)., Unresolved,0
