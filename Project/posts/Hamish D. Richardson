Thursday September 19th 2013 9:32 am -04:00,When using the design recipe to create a fuction I often run into the situation where the task at hand really should be handeled by more than one function. My question is how or should I mention this when designing the original function?   I will use the example given in this course for function reuse:def perimeter(side1 side2 side3):    (number number number) -> number    Return the perimeter of a triangle with sides of length    side1 side2 and side3.    >>> perimeter(3 4 5)    12    >>> perimeter(10.5 6 9.3)    25.8        return side1 + side2 + side3def semiperimeter(side1 side2 side3):    (number number number) -> float    Return the perimeter of a triangle with sides of    length side1 side2 and side3.    >>> semiperimeter(3 4 5)    6.0    >>> semiperimeter(10.5 6 9.3)    12.9        return perimeter(side1 side2 side3) / 2Also I will not be able to test my original fuction until the subfunction has been designed and tested first. Was just looking for ideas to keep things straight.Note:I did notice that the actual name of the function perimeter is used in the description for semiperimeter but was this on purpose? Should it not say Return the semiperimeter of a triangle....  Thanks ,None,0

Friday October 4th 2013 4:16 pm -04:00,Make sure you have the file name right. wordlist1.txt is not the same as wordslist1.txt. I just found this myself and I think it is just a minor typo. Then I would create a separate folder (maybe named Assignment3) and have a fresh copy of a3.py a3_driver.py wordlist1.txt and board1.txt inside. Then open all of them in IDLE. The a3_driver.py calls read_words(words_file) with words_file already pointing to wordlist1.txt open for reading. However if you just want to test read_words without having to run a3_driver first run a3.py then go to the interactive screen in idle To make sure the interpreter is working in the folder you just created run the following:>>>import os>>> os.chdir(C:\\<path>\\Assignment3)for example mine is>>>import os>>> os.chdir(C:\\Projects\\Learning To Program\\Assignments\\Assignment3)if you want to be sure you are in the right directory run:>>>os.listdir()and it should list the four filesthen its just a matter of opening up the file for reading directly>>>tmp_words_file = open(wordlist1.txtr) and using it in your read_words() function>>>read_words(tmp_words_file)[CRUNCHY COWS EAT GRASS], Unresolved,1
