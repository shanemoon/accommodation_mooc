Sunday September 1st 2013 2:51 am -04:00,there are two numerical type weve seen so far. The int type and the float type.int type stand for integer here is an example : 1 20  35  47float type are number with dot (I mean the decimal one) like youve mention above .example 1.2 25.456 and also 2.0the symbol / is for  a float division typethe symbol // one is for int division typeexample : >>> 4 / 2 2.0    ( we get a float result in here because its a float division of  a float type)>>> 4//22   (here we get an int result because its an int division)However dividing an int by a float type or vice versa always gives us a float type result no matter which type of division were using>>> -4 // 2.0-2.0>>3.5 // 50.0 (yeahthats it because were working with a limited memory with python), Unresolved,0
