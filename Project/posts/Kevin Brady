Tuesday August 20th 2013 10:22 am -04:00,There should be a program called IDLE in a folder called Python 3.3 in your applications folder if you ran the install with the default location.  If you didnt run the installer you should find a file named something like python-3.3.2-macosx10.6.dmg in your downloads folder.  (Im guessing that the 10.6 could be 10.7 or 10.8 depending on which version of OS X you are using.  Also you might not see the .dmg depending on how you have your system set up.)  Double click the dmg file to open it and then double click the Python (or Python.mpkg) file to run the installer and follow the instructions.  After completing this then you should find the Python 3.3 folder in your applications folder.  Im using OS X 10.6.8 and this is what I did.  I assume 10.7.x and 10.8.x are very similar., Unresolved,0
