Monday August 19th 2013 2:24 am -04:00,Dear friends Im a predominant 2X user. I think 2x has a lot of advantage and support and is mostly preferred for various new APIetc. THis made me go for 2x when starting to learn but here I think I should start learning 3x.Â Please share you thoughts for newbies. Why learn 3x first instead to 2x?Whats considered best practice-- going for Python 2.7 first and then 3x?What are the differences? Why is 3x considered better? Are there any better features?Im eager to read your replies.happy learningArun J, Resolved,0
