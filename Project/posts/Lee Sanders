Saturday September 21st 2013 6:03 pm -04:00,I hope that the professors and coursera review the volume of comments for question 9.  Though the concepts of str are covered in the videos the concept of nested functions is not.  Sometimes programming classes become frustrating when hours are spent trying to figure something out without the appropriate knowledge tools.  To do question #9 there should have been a video or example that showed the syntax for nested functions and incrementing functions. This would have been a great assistance to all as indicated by the volume of comments on #9., Unresolved,3
