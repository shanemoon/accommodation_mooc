Wednesday September 4th 2013 7:23 am -04:00,The most elegant way for the seconds is using modulo: (If you devide whatever number you have through 60 using modulo you will always get a remainder of under 60 back.)what_ever_seconds % 60Lets assume you have 263 seconds and divide them through 60.Think of it that way: The divisor 60 fill fit 4 times in 263 the remainder of this operation will be 23. 263 // 60 (integer division) will yield 4263 % 60 (modulo division) will yield 23263 / 60 (ordinary division) will yield 4.3833333333333333333333333333333, Unresolved,2

Saturday September 14th 2013 7:27 pm -04:00,This is what olimex writes about their competitors:RASPBERRY PI have not released CAD files nor complete schematics 	RPi uses processors from Broadcom which are not available for sale in small 	quantities and it uses a BGA package which requires an expensive setup to assembly. While RPi 	is designed to be a home gadget OLINUXINO will work in industrial environment 	-25+85C and will be designed to be low cost yet NOISE immune.BeagleBone have open source CAD hardware files but the use of a BGA 	processor and a BB board is very complex and hard to manufacture in small quantities.

Thursday September 26th 2013 3:01 pm -04:00,An expression using slice notation (using a colon in the square brackets) will evaluate to a list.

Monday September 23rd 2013 6:24 am -04:00,The Rice course starts where this course here is starting but it gets rid of all aspects you dont have to know in order to program: design recipes stack frames etc. It was my first course and its absolutely doable if you dont take any other courses at the same time.

Tuesday September 24th 2013 5:16 pm -04:00,Chris: I havent attended the MIT class. Its harder than the Rice course from the syllabus (more concepts in less time to catch and probably more advanced math). The Rice one takes 8 - 16 hours (depending on yourself) a week (2 quizzes and a mini-project to do every week) only standard math involved. At Rice the community is awesome: Instant feed-back on the forum there seem even coders there who just like to introduce others to python.,None,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 4:43 pm -04:00,Toms first example is yours (using  -> a list) the second example is altered (using () -> a tuple). Tuples are immutable and therefore can become keys in a dictionary. Lists cant be keys in dictionaries. If it would not be like that your dictionary easily could become worthless if some of your functions for instance alters the list that serves as a specific key. You would lose access to your value., Unresolved,1
Tuesday October 1st 2013 7:27 pm -04:00,A variable put in a list puts the value of the variable into the list.Todd - It only points to some value. Its like a reference. In the tuple you cant change this pointer anymore. In lists you can.Another example on whats going on:>>> dog = beagle>>> id(dog)15650560>>> tuple =(porthos isadog)>>> id(tuple[3])15650560>>> tuple(porthos is a beagle)>>> dog = ninja                   # Assigns a new memory address to the variable dog.>>> id(dog)15865088>>> id(tuple[3])                    # Still points to:15650560# You can use the function id() to check identities:>>> help(id)                        Help on built-in function id in module builtins:id(...)    id(object) -> integer        Return the identity of an object.  This is guaranteed to be unique among    simultaneously existing objects.  (Hint: its the objects memory address.), Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:15 am -04:00,Well Im a beginner and its just a skill for me (i.e. I have no intentions to go much beyond Python). But your question is dependend on what you are up to. So it is wrongly phrased. There is no best language. What is best will be dependend on your purpose. Python is not that fast because its an interpreter-language. Thats why many write modules in C for it. That makes it limited useful for real-time applications like professional games and anything that goes to the professional market and demands real-time behavior. Its also not that great for visual arts at the moment. I did a Processing course over the summer and that language would be much more suited and built for this purpose.- On the other hand Python is on board of most linux-distributions. - It has become very common in science because it is easy to grasp and flexible (sort of hot glue). Science for many things doesnt demand realtime. There are complex math modules like numpy.- Elegant syntax.- Good and fast for prototyping for people who then will build the programm in harder languages.- Huge community (it counts),None,1
