Sunday September 29th 2013 12:34 am -04:00,Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Note that the last line of the input file for a board does not have a newline character.For those with read_board error as above when the function worked for you before submissionOn my Mac the board1.txt file DOES HAVE  a  after the last line. I downloaded it from the assignment page and immediately opened and printed its contents without opening the file with any other program. However the error message indicates that the last line is not supposed to end with a newline. Thus if you write a read_board function with code that assumes a newline character ends every line including the last line it may work on your local machine but will fail when you submit it. I.e. if you append all but the last character of EVERY line or use the length of the line -1 to control the number of times for the loop your code will fail when submitted. However if you use line.strip()That will remove the newline if it exists and leave the line the way it is if no newline. So works on local file with newline at end and also when submitted.The staff should  verify that the last line of the board1.txt file posted for download does not have newline in the last line. If that is true then the function description should state what the error message says: Note that the last line of the input file for a board does not have a newline character.instead of leaving it to the error message., Unresolved,0
