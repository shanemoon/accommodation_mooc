Wednesday October 2nd 2013 3:03 am -04:00,does in pyhton every variable is automatically initialized to 0??, Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 9:33 am -04:00,well Nick thanks... I know the variable has to be created before initialization comes into picture.......i was asking about initialization in a context like>>>for i in range(10):       print(i) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9where i starts with 0..........it does happen in case of for loop I suppose, Unresolved,0
