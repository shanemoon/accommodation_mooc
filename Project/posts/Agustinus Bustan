Saturday September 28th 2013 1:39 am -04:00,It took me about 4 hours to get 37/37. I was stuck at 30/37. I didnt understand the error until I read the error do not use open. Then I was stuck again at 33/37: read_board function. I didnt know that the board should be list of list of str until I saw the example on early function how the board should be., Resolved,1
Saturday September 28th 2013 3:52 pm -04:00,The last 2 functions are confusing to me. There is not any clue how the functions should work. But I figured it out by really look at the errors message when I submitted my assignment.Anyway here what I can tell:- if you look at a3_driver.py where the functions are called and the file is open already and save in the argument for the function. You just need to process the it like: Â word_file.readline() or board_file.readline()- use rstrip(/n) before you append it to the list in the loop then return it as complete list. [crucnhy grass cows]- and for the read_board: I use 2 lists. board and x_board. First I readline form the file save it as string rstrip() then append it to x_board for each char. [attx] then I append to the board. I use 2 loops.- return as complete board list of list [[attx][jcdt]]Hope it would help you. Good luck, Resolved,0
