Saturday September 14th 2013 7:27 pm -04:00,1st submission of A2.py gave the following ERROR message on all functions despite all working in IDLE:ERROR: TabErrorinconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation.So I backspaced all the tabs and used spaces to replace the indented code and just resubmitted the Get Length function - SUCCESS so I then resubmitted all the functions but received the following ERROR messages:ERROR: IndentationErrorexpected an indented block.I am using Notepad++ for the editing.Obviously I am doing something fundamentally wrong but cant see what and am running out of hours.CheersDave, Unresolved,0

But I only have to wait 2 days and then I start An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python. Never used Python before and this course has certainly impressed me.Well done guys!, Unresolved,1
