Sunday September 1st 2013 7:19 am -04:00,Yep thats right. I had 41 but resubmitted now to check it out and got 42/41. It was a pretty fun assignment and Im really enjoying this course., Unresolved,1

The 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 example is a good one but the error is very small so its easy to shrug it off. It gets more significant if you try something like 0.7 + 0.2 + 0.1. , Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 3:51 am -04:00,Yeah you are very close. Your second and third example is _almost_ right. Just remember that in your second search you dont want to start at zero and be mindful of what Etienne says., Resolved,0
