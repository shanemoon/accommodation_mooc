Wednesday September 4th 2013 8:28 pm -04:00,Im looking at Week 3 Lecture: Type bool . The last in-video quiz asks what English sentence(s) make(s) the following disjunctive Python expression True: (math_grade >= 50) or (bio_grade >= 50) or (cs_grade >=50) I think the answers include all the last three English sentences namely     The student passed all three courses.     The student passed at least one course.     The student passed some but not all courses.     (the condition is of course given that the passing grade is 50.)But as I submit it shows incorrect. Did I miss something?, Unresolved,3
Wednesday September 4th 2013 9:04 pm -04:00,The answer is True as I anticipated. And your point? , Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 9:19 pm -04:00,Glad you see it too Paul! So is there a mistake in the quiz or did we both miss something? , Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 10:47 pm -04:00,Thank you Luis!! Though Im still not getting it..., Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 10:49 pm -04:00,Um.. What exactly is the trick here?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 11:06 pm -04:00,Ive got the expression correct. Though I do not understand a detail in this question. In the question it says that when s2 does not occur in s1 then the expression should return -1. I tried my correct expression in IDLE and it does produce -1 when s2 is not in s1. But I cannot see why. Someone helps explain? , Resolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 1:34 am -04:00,I see. So its just a property of the .find method. Thank you Tom!, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 11:09 pm -04:00,One of the choices in this question is letters = letters.sort()But when print(letters)>>>Noneit does not give the correct answer but prints out None. Why is this? , Resolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 1:42 am -04:00,Thank you Karl for the explanation. letters.sort() does not return a value it just sorts. A very subtle difference for me! How do you remember all these details? Do you always look it up? And do such details matter often?  , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 11:11 pm -04:00,From reading the code I dont understand why the choices should print out the desired outcome -- seem not! What happens in the next question Q11 is what Id expect. But for Q10 whats the trick? , Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 1:38 am -04:00,Seems like it should be like what you said here. But isnt b=a an assignment statement - which means that the list a is now assigned to b? Then why should any change in b affect a?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 10:45 pm -04:00,I think I get what you mean thanks!, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 10:45 pm -04:00,THanks Ravi!, Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 11:07 pm -04:00,Hey @Urko could you help explain how you get around your issue? I am getting the same error message False is not true : Board not loaded correctly/False is not true: Non-square board not loaded correctly./False is not true : Board not loaded correctly. Did you get rows and columns mixed up?My game (a3_driver.py) runs but isnt really the whole game. There must be something wrong. Many thanks!!, Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 10:55 pm -04:00,I have the same error messages as dANIEL. And I wish that I could understand Toms explanation!, Resolved,0
