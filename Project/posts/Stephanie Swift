Sunday September 1st 2013 3:17 pm -04:00,Im having trouble wrapping my head around how to write a return body in a function that includes words (strings) rather than numbers.Mainly this pertains to the def count_letters task presented in assignment 2. I wanted to practise by writing my own count_vowels function so I got as far as:def count_vowels(word):     (str) -> int    Return the number of vowels in the word.    >>>count_vowels(happy)    1    >>>count_vowels(eager)    3    Now Im at the stage of writing the return body and am totally stuck! How do I instruct Python to understand what a vowel is (will it understand the provided examples and work off them?) and finish off my function?, Unresolved,0
