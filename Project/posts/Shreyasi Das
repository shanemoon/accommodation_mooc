Sunday August 18th 2013 11:18 pm -04:00,Hi everyone!!I am a 3D computer graphics artist working for an animation studio with experience in feature animation. I just graduated last year and work primarily in Autodesk Maya. Although I deal with more of the artistic side of things I would like to start learning programming so that I can make scripts to make artists lives easier :) This is my first time learning programming but I love math and logic so I am really excited about taking this course!-Shreyasi,None,0
