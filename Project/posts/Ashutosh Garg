Monday September 16th 2013 9:52 am -04:00,The int in the function call is the position in which you have to insert the string... So first find the position... Then insert the second string then continue with the first one... You should use a new variable to store the combined string... Use the for loop... , Unresolved,0

Monday September 16th 2013 10:05 am -04:00,It is not in one line... You have to use 2 situation using the if condition... First whether you have to add the characters of dna1(the first string) and second whether you have to add the characters of dna2... So the condition depends on the position which you are at... For example in your original post until you come at position 2 you will add characters of dna1 in inserted... Then when you reach at position 2 you should add the dna2 plus the character in dna1(as your loop will run only 4 times) and then again you have to add the remaining characters of dna1... So in short find the position... Add dna1 character.. . Around the position add dna2 characters... Then add the remaining dna1 characters... Hope it makes sense , Unresolved,0
