Friday September 27th 2013 11:34 am -04:00,Im new to this and have really struggled with this assignment. So far Ive invested 8 hours and only one function to show for it. Im stuck right now with the second function and no real guidance from the Forum on best approach. What would help me would be more samples and worked examples. Thats the big gap in this course no real scaffolding for learners to build upon previous worked examples. It would also be helpful to see solved assignments after the hard deadline so I can learn and be exposed to other approaches. , Unresolved,6
