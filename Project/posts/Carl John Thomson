Friday August 30th 2013 4:24 pm -04:00,Assuming you have opened a new window in the Python program to write your function. (File -> New Window)Think of this as your instruction manual to the Python program such that when you ask it to use your defined function perimeter it will look at the manual and start to execute it.You have provided your instructions and examples for anybody wanting to use your function (anything placed between the    ........   )Next you are instructing Python how it will run the function the window will not provide the >>> because you are not running any code. You are showing Python what it will need to do the line should be auto-indented and the Python Shell will provide auto-formatting for the default key words (return in this case).I hope this has helped with your question. Once the window has been saved and you run the module (Run -> Run Module) the Python Shell should Restart and you will be able to use your function perimeter., Unresolved,1
