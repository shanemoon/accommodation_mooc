Tuesday August 27th 2013 7:38 am -04:00,The deadlines calender is very helpful for this. https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/calendar/indexIt also seems to be auto-correcting to my timezone nicely.I am also very much in favour of having a single time zone. ,None,1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 7:31 am -04:00,I completely understand the need for a convention in this and think it is very helpful.Can I ask is this convention something used purely as an instructional method or is this necessary to python?This is just a general query - I dont want to encourage anyone to make their functions less readable than they would otherwise be. , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 8:16 am -04:00,Im having a similar problem --- it looks to be a formatting issue but I dont know where to go with this. For all of my answers I get the following error message/cide Message:ERROR: TabErrorinconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation(./a2.py 37 18 for char in dna:)Whats really confusing me is that I assumed (./a2.py 37 18 must refer to either lines columns but both lines are provided in the starter code and these are showing up as errors for all my functions.So for example the following function is giving me the above errordef get_length(dna):     (str) -> int    Return the length of the DNA sequence dna.    >>> get_length(ATCGAT)    6    >>> get_length(ATCG)    4    >>> get_length()    0        [~ep]--- I know there is a simpler way to write this but I wanted to practice for. I have also tried the simpler method and it gave me the same error message. , Resolved,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:58 am -04:00,I have the feeling that you are actually really close so I dont think that anything bad would happen if you did. , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:07 am -04:00,The handout says You can assume that the index is valid So I left out theif statement altogether.But the rest is very similar to what I wrote., Resolved,0
