Monday September 23rd 2013 8:50 am -04:00,HeyI know Im leaving this late but Ive been away for a little bit so have been unable to do the assignment earlier.Im on a train rocketing through the videos and exercises however I have come to the assignment and I cannot download the py file or the html files as the trains wifi has the hosting on a denied list.Is there any chance someone could mirror the files on dropbox or something for me as I will miss the deadline if I cant do it on this train.Thanks in advanceJoel., Unresolved,0
