Tuesday August 20th 2013 10:13 am -04:00,Hi!I was wondering if you could make further classes available for those that already finished their assignments are too eager to start next topics or like me have the time to dedicate to his course this week and not so much time on the following week. If you could at least leave week 2 lectures and assignments it would be of great help.Thanks a lot!,None,1
Monday August 26th 2013 7:59 pm -04:00,Ive tested all my codes and everything is working fine. However I did not get all scores for the assignment.Using my background on PERL Ive used the rationale that is more familiar to me. So for instance my get_minutes looks like this:return int((seconds/3600 - int(seconds/3600))*60)Surely this is not what the grader expects but this surely works just like the expected solution (like using the // and % operators).I dont think it is fair to give a lower grade just because Ive used another solution but thats fine grading students individually on a MOOC would be a tremendous work.Just to say if the grader only accepts expected coding and not necessarily those that give the same answer I believe Ill be in trouble in no time.. :(, Resolved,1
Monday August 26th 2013 8:25 pm -04:00,OK my code gives correct answers except that my results are printed as float; perhaps the grader is expecting int?How can I change the variable type?, Resolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 8:39 pm -04:00,Hey Etienne thanks for such prompt and helpful answers!!Youre right theres not a single print() Im referring to testing my functions on IDLE. Such a great tool it is! Im used to the much less user-friendly PERL debugger.Its actually the get_seconds function that is outputting a float. It does involve an int but theres other function afterwards that generates the float.Ill see to including an int() onto that function well see how  it goes...Thanks again!, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 2:02 pm -04:00,Hey Etienne just to confirm that my get_seconds just needed an int().Turns out it really was a type issue. Got a 41/41 now.Thanks!, Resolved,0

Thursday August 29th 2013 3:13 pm -04:00,Hi JeremyH!Just a reminder:12-(+1) = 1112-(-1) = 13Also you may want to take a look on the function thats provided as example: to_24_hour_clock().Was it useful? :), Resolved,5
Wednesday September 4th 2013 9:17 pm -04:00,Does this subject (frames stacks) have a practical application or is it only a pedagogic (teaching) resource?I mean other than realizing the scope (global/local) and memory allocation by functions. Does it have other uses?, Resolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 7:39 pm -04:00,That was an enjoyable assignment Im just hoping we will have more bioinformatics assignments/exercises! (are we?), Unresolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 9:29 am -04:00,Why have you nested a while inside a for?The code is in infinite loop inside the while.You could do this just using a for... just drop the while!, Unresolved,1
Thursday September 26th 2013 5:49 pm -04:00,This is just out of curiosity.. Have you already sorted out all functions? How much time did it took you?I´ve spent around 2 hours between reading understanding and implementing and still not 100% done.I estimate It´ll take me about 3 hours total to finalize the assignment.Boy final exam will be TOUGH..., Unresolved,0
