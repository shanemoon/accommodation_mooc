Friday August 23rd 2013 10:47 pm -04:00,Excellent!! Thanks for all the responses above this problem bugs me for the whole night!And one more thing if you save the triangle_area module (like she did in the video) where would you actually save it? ( or does it really matter?) the system default saving designation is the System32 folder which appears very odd to me. Any thoughts on this?Thanks!, Resolved,0
