Wednesday August 21st 2013 12:47 pm -04:00,The syntax of round() is:    round(x [ n])which returns x rounded to n digits from the decimal point.like:    round(32.3432 2) gives 32.34    round(32.3432) gives a whole number 32, Resolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 10:50 am -04:00,first I tried the answer(string) -> integerwhich was said to be wrong. Then I wrote down the answer shown in the picture below but it is also incorrect. Could anyone here tell me why? thanks!, Resolved,0

Thursday September 5th 2013 9:26 pm -04:00,Michael gives a good example. Lets say grade1 and grade2 are both greater than 50 then for the first if statement we get num_passed to be 2. But the other lower two if statements are not nested into the first one they are separated which means they have to be executed step by step whether or not the first if statement is true. So for the example Michael takes well get 1 in the console even if result 2 is expected. , Resolved,2
Sunday September 8th 2013 10:44 am -04:00,Hello allWhen applying to numbers what is the difference between int and trunc? Bellow are some examples hope someone could help. thanks.>>>int(24.71)24>>>int(-24.71)-24>>>import math>>>math.trunc(24.71)24>>>math.trunc(-24.71)-24, Unresolved,1
Sunday September 8th 2013 9:31 pm -04:00,okay that means we have int to do anything trunc can do and do anything trunc cannot do. Then why do we need trunc? There should be some reason that someone invented this function. Could you explain a little more or just show me some resources linking to the reasons. Thanks in advance., Unresolved,0
