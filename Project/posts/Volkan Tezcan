Thursday September 12th 2013 9:19 am -04:00,Hi allLets say these are my strings:>>> s1 = 0111110111011101>>> s2 = 11This is an image I created in Paint to see which char has which position in string s1:The index of first occurrence of s2 in s1 is position 1. As you can see in the picture above or get it by this code :>>> s1.find(s2)1My question is where is the second occurrence?At position 2Â ? or position 3 ?Which one is the answer this question is looking for?This question can be understood in two ways.For me it should be 3 because that point is the end of s2s first occurrence in s1 and it should be started to look for second occurrence from that point on.or is it position 2 if we interpret it like this:- VolkanPS: I could also give expressions for both of these possibilities but I dont see a spoiler tag in this forum editor. :)), Resolved,2

I think I missed that detail and that detail was what I was looking for in this thread.Thank both of you!When I try to answer questions like these before sleep my eyes tend to skip some parts of the question and then I wonder why my correct answer is not working. xD, Resolved,0
