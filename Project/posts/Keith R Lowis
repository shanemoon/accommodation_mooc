Tuesday August 27th 2013 10:38 am -04:00,Good morning        Allow me to get this straight. Variable before expression... boston_tea = 1773 (the variable here is the boston_tea and its expression can change at any point as long as you assign its difference) lets just say I change it to boston_tea = 1216 (now the expression is 1216 instead of the 1773 as earlier presented). I think Ive got this down. , Resolved,1
