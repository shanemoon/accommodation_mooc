Monday August 26th 2013 4:06 am -04:00,When it really comes down to it you wont be asking yourself Which language is the best? Instead youll be asking Which language is the best for the problem at hand?Some languages are better than others at certain things. C++ falls down when youre trying to make something portable between OS whereas Python and Java dont worry as much. Although in terms of speed they fall well short of C++. And say youre looking to do some web stuff in that case things like PHP become your best friend.The best advice you can be given is not to peg yourself to a language youll enjoy some more than others and therell be some that you downright hate (Visual Basic for example :D ) But you dont use a spanner to hammer in a nail youll come to points where another language will be the best option and will save you a lot of heartache.Most importantly dont think of this as learning to program in Python instead think that you are learning to program. Really what you want to get out of this is an idea of what you can do and what the basic structures of Procedural/OO Programming are. (Most of the time learning your second or third language will be based off saying I could do this in <language x> how can it be done in <language y>?) once you know whats possible you have a better idea of what to type into google to make it so in that new language., Unresolved,2

Thursday August 29th 2013 2:15 am -04:00,I think something that is quite confusing about this is what the python interpreter actually doing with a returned value.>>> def average(num1 num2):	return (num1 + num2) / 2>>> average(1 2)1.5>>> The interpreter does something here that you wouldnt see in a script. If you make yourself a .py file and put the definition and the function call in it so...def average(num1 num2):    return (num1 + num2) / 2average(1 2)Now save and run that module youll notice that no output is displayed.This is because when you return a value from a function the python interpreter does something different when you return from a function and have nothing for that value to be placed in and prints the result on the screen When using the interpreter calling a function without placing the return value anywhere is like calling>>> tmp = average(12)>>> print(tmp)Perhaps its Python trying to be helpful., Resolved,0

When defining add you are telling python that every time add is called the user will include two arguments.Somewhere in your code youll call add say add(12) or even add(somevariable someothervariable)In this case 1 and 2 or somevariable and someothervariable are arguments. They are the items that fullfill the parameters.The way I think about it is this:Think of Parameters when youre defining a function.Parameters are the rules of what must be included in the function call whenever you call a function you must have as many arguments as you have parameters.Arguments are used when youre calling/invoking a function.Arguments are what is passed a function they hold the information you want the function to use.To be honest Ive never seen anwhere else where the distinction between parameters and arguments has been so stressed.

This is true. So the body of the if statement is executed. return True is called we exit the function and tell the calling function that the result was true. Running isTempRight(30) this time we try 30 == 22.5. This is not true so the body of the if statement is skipped we move straight down to return False.

Monday September 9th 2013 8:52 pm -04:00,Recursion. Its beautiful and brutal all at once.Think about it in terms of the Fibonacci sequence function.We know that each number in the Fibonacci sequence is calculated by adding the previous two numbers together. So 0 1 1 2 3 5 8...Recursion works by having a base case (In this case fib(0) = 0 and fib(1)) and then having a well defined way to work backwards from any case to our base case.Say we call fib(3) what were expecting to happen is this...fib(3) 3 != 1 and 3 != 0 so return the result of fib(2)+ fib(1)     fib(2) 2 != 1 and 2 != 0 so return the result of fib(1) +  fib(0)         fib(1) returns 1         Fib(0) returns 0     fib(2) = fib(1) + fib(0) = 1 + 0 = 1          fib(1) returns 1fib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1) = 1 + 1 = 2So the third number in the Fibonacci sequence is 2.A few things to watch out for:1. If your base case isnt right or your working backwards isnt right your program will crash.2. If you delve too deeply with recursion youll run out of memory and your program will fail.3. Usually if you can do something recursively you can also do it iteratively (using a loop of some kind). iteratively usually ends up being a bit nicer on your memory.,None,1
Tuesday September 10th 2013 12:55 am -04:00,Another simple recursive function would be finding a character in a string. For example:def findChar(s char):   if s == :       return False   if s[0] == char       return True   return findChar(s[1:] char)I know I know we could just say return char in s but this is an example.In this case we have two different base classes:1. The string is empty we know the character is not here.2. The first character in the string is the one that we are looking for. The character is inside the string.So say we called findChar(Average r) if we work through how this would execute we can build a table:Call # | Current String | Is the first character r? | Next statement to execute1 | Average | No | findChar(verage r)2 | verage | No | findChar(erage r)3 | erage | No | findChar(rage r)4 | erage | Yes | return True Or maybe weÂ  try with findChar(Tim u):Call # | Current String | Is the first character r? | Next statement to execute1 | Tim | No | findChar(im u)2 | im | No | findChar(m u)3 | m | No | findChar( u)4 |  | No | return False As you can see the way recursion works is we use what we do know (We know that if the string is empty then the character is not in the string and we know that if the character we want is the first character in the string to search than it does exist in the string) in order to solve our problem by breaking down to that level. In mathematics recursion is based off saying that if you can solve a problem p for p(0) and if you can solve a problem for p(1) then you can use this to solve any problem for p(n)In regards of what gets returned remember when we were doing things like return 1 == 1 the 1 == 1 is evaluated before it is returned so in the example of findChar(Average r):findChar(Average r):                   ^->     findChar(verage r):             |    ->     findChar(erage r):          |        ->     findChar(rage r): True! |In this way the last called function is worked through first and the value gets passed back up through the stack.Sorry for the long windedness as a Prolog programmer I love recursion.,None,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:58 pm -04:00,Programming in Python is just writing out a series of steps. If you know all the steps (Which you should when youre the one writing the steps) then youll know what the output of a function will be.Tracing by hand is great for testing because you can keep a list in your head of where the program is at any given moment what all of the values are and whats going on.Say you have a function that when you give it the value 4 you expect it to return 16. If the function instead returns 12 you can work through the steps yourself and see where there might be a bug in your code.Personally Id rather trace things by hand than use a debugger in all but the most extreme of examples. But thats because I find most of the debuggers irritating and slow., Unresolved,3

This is working off my own set of test cases and my own assignment 2 file.Size of file: 2724 bytesNumber of test cases: 50Time taken on my computer: 25ms on average.Using these numbers lets say that everyone that enrolled in the course is submitting their assignments well use the worst case here if they all submit at the same time then we would see 168.86 Mb of data needing to be downloaded to the server on the next poll of submitted assignments (65000*2724) This would also cause the amount of testing time to be around 25*65000 milliseconds which actually ends up being around half an hour. This is quite a simple outlook I havent bothered considering a parallel running of the marking. I also dont include the time needed to output the results to the webpage.Consider that everyone is submitting once every 5-10 seconds its quite clear that without a decent sized gap between submissions would cause an almost constant load on the server.Moving down lets consider if only the people who submitted something for assignment 1 managed to do so for assignment two. In the announcements this is listed as 3874. so...3874*2724 = 10552776 so closer to 10 MbAnd 25*3874 = 9685 which is just over a minute.I think the original delay was created to ensure that in the worst case the number of people submitting could be handled.

Look up pythons dictionaries they allow you to create lists that have keys.So youd be able to do things like have a list of dictionaries and say results[1][Name] == DickI wont tell you how to do this because its 1am Ive got work tomorrow and Im too tired to hack together some code but your code would look something like this:readline list of headingssplit headers up to get each header [ID Name Marks Rank]For each record of file:   Get next line   Divide up string in sections   Build dictionary [ID=1 Name=Tom Marks=76 Rank=3]   Add this to a list of dictionariesOnce you have this list of dictionaries built up you can access a record using the index of the record and then use the label to get the exact data you want.Happy coding if you have any questions ask and Ill try to answer in the morning. :)Link to dictionaries documentation: http://docs.python.org/3.2/tutorial/datastructures.html, Unresolved,0

However there are going to be times when theyll say Did you need that much documentation?Id say keep the docstrings they are great for getting a quick look at whats happening in your code.Keep comments that are unnecessary to a minimum for parts of it youre going to find that your code is pretty self explanatory and if not you can rewrite the layout/change some variable names to help with this.On the topic of unit tests perhaps put them in a separate file? That way they wont get in the way of the actual code.,None,0
