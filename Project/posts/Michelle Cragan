Monday August 26th 2013 5:26 pm -04:00,I believe the answers to the last two in-video quiz questions are reversed based on the stage of execution indicated by the red arrow., Unresolved,5
Friday September 27th 2013 5:22 pm -04:00,It might help to read a little more of this thread below.  The quiz answers are correct...just hard for a new programmer to grasp based on the lectures alone.  Use the visualizer and you will begin to understand that Python only looks at the first line of the function definition initially.  It will not begin to look inside the function until it gets a call on the function., Unresolved,0
Monday August 26th 2013 5:57 pm -04:00,After looking at the explanations and a glance at the Lecture Summary the answers do appear to be right.  Ill have to spend more time with the Lecture Summary to get a better understanding., Unresolved,1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 11:10 pm -04:00,I agree.  Although this is the first concept I truly didnt understand without further research there have been several previous in-video quiz questions that were not explained within the lecture., Unresolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 12:45 pm -04:00,If you enter it in the Visualizer and step through it makes.  But just given the screen shot on the second to last question (with the green arrow on line 8 and the red arrow on line 9) it appears that lines 11 and 12 have not yet been executed.  To an experienced programmer is that intuitive?, Unresolved,1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 11:07 pm -04:00,Thanks Etienne.  I think were starting to get it.  Maybe you could keep our questions in mind for future sessions of the course.  It would be very helpful if the lecture videos were more explicit about this and other concepts., Unresolved,2
