Wednesday September 25th 2013 5:53 am -04:00,join the question. i am a complete beginner in programming as well and even when it seems to me I understand everything in videos i need to check everything again and again while taking quizzes or doing assignments. to tell the truth it is surprising that i made through until the week 6 and still enjoy it. :), Resolved,2
Saturday September 28th 2013 6:33 am -04:00,what a nice post :) the last time I had a real math class was at school I have never programmed before and English is not my mother tongue. Still I enjoy every lecture and every assignment although the posts on the forum seem sometimes really complicated - thats true :) maybe I will never programm as a job in the future but I think it is still a wonderful work-out for the brain., Resolved,2

For more than an hour I tried to find the problem until I understood that I used == instead of = in one line. stupid me... need to be more careful with all those symbols.thank you again!, Unresolved,0
