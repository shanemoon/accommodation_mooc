An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters underscores and digits (0 to 9).Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @ $ and % within identifiers. Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in Python.,None,0
