Namely should then the text have ONLY one uppercased word per line or it can have more words independently of their being uppercase or lowecase letters? THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!! I ask because my output is: [Carmens FART is DOUBLEWIDE tell her to STOP or my nose will EXPLODE]Should then just be the uppercased word??? Thanks a lot!!!!!, Unresolved,0

Tuesday October 1st 2013 11:32 am -04:00,Ahh how great thank you very much!!!Â In connection with the code thats the one that Ive implemented though it gives me some failures when submitting the assignment. Ive spent so much time thinking on it that I think I will leave it like that! How awful!!!!, Unresolved,0

I just have two for loops no if-statements at all and a couple of empty lists to which Ive appended the things in the for loops to create the list of lists! Dont know it that will help you but lots of good luck!, Unresolved,0
