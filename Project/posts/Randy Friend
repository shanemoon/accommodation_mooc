Monday August 26th 2013 8:56 pm -04:00,Looking at the code in the quetion...x = -10y = abs(x)x = 11What is the value of Y at the end?  This is easy to over think.  They value of y only changes when you see y =.  Changing the value of x after the y =  (assignment) does not change y as there is no new assignment being processed thus the answer to what is the value of y after all the code is run is the same as what is the value of y if there were only the first two lines of code or ...x = -10y = abs(x), Unresolved,3
Monday August 26th 2013 8:43 pm -04:00,I dont full understand what you are asking but if you are asking why new_result is = result + 1 it is due to exactly what the line is stating.  Note result is not calling a function.  It is just a variable holding a value.If you said new_result = result + sum(1 3) you would be calling the function another time and getting a larger value but just saying result + 1  is the same as things like my_age + 1 1 + 1 etc, Resolved,0

Wednesday September 4th 2013 5:40 pm -04:00,As I stated I understand the reason behind this but it also depends on what the data is used for and whether you want to throw away any data by dropping all hours over 23 (24 is technically 0 hours).  If we are only using the data for time (note even UTC is a date time value) then the value should be from 0 - 23 not 0 - 24.To further state this if asked what date and time will it be in 55555 seconds the result is not just a response in hours minutes and seconds.  Day or hours > 23 will also have to be factored., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 7:30 pm -04:00,I think everyone is missing the point that I understand why the value is returned as 0 - 23 now.  If it was not stated as a value from 0 - 23 it would be wrong to just drop the hours over 24.  Yes sometimes the client knows what they want and sometimes most of the times actually they think they know and it is up to the programmer to make sure they fully understand the edge cases and what they think they want is in line with what they will get and why.  Clients change their minds on what they want a lot of the times simply because they did not think through edge cases., Resolved,0
