Friday August 30th 2013 10:30 am -04:00,yep im stuck here. In two possibility i may be failing one (or both):not understading what is asked or doing something wrong in the code.Or im not even using something that i should.So i got the get_hours right and went to do a similar thing on get_minutes and _seconds apparently i was super wrong.So what im missing? I wrote the code in many ways (only missing upside-down hehe) i searched in the forum i tried and nothing.Used % and // nothing. Used 3600 and 60 nothing. So i suppose im missing/not understanding some point.I would appreciate some guidance (again) im really lost on this one. I can even go to the point to say: explain to me as if i was a kid.Sometimes is what i need. Lol. Thank you in advance., Resolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 1:32 pm -04:00,I believe when you tell me its very instructive and straight forward because yes it is. But you or other people may relate that sometimes you find something so straight forward/easy that you get confused by its simplicity. And at least me when im around the problem for too long it gets harder.But now with everyones help i have a clearer idea. And i thank you all!, Resolved,0
