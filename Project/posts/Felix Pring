Sunday September 15th 2013 9:16 am -04:00,Just in case: Will there be any provision for those who start the final exam and then lose their internet connection or similiar disaster for longer than the allotted time left to complete it? Thanks, Resolved,4
Saturday September 14th 2013 9:45 pm -04:00,Should I get some tracing paper and hold it up to the screen and try and copy the code onto it by pencil? I doubt it but I dont think anyone has explained what trace by hand means., Unresolved,0
Friday September 20th 2013 7:38 pm -04:00,Me too it only seems to happen with Pauls lectures and not Jens as if hes temporarily obscured the microphone with his notes or something.PS I noticed that the correct spelling is used for colour unlike the US color. Is this the general practice in Canada?, Unresolved,0

Sunday September 22nd 2013 11:08 am -04:00,Ive experienced it before on at least two of Pauls earlier lectures but unfortunately didnt make a note which ones they were. If I encounter them again during revision Ill flag them here., Unresolved,0
Wednesday October 2nd 2013 9:19 pm -04:00,Week 5 Video 4 Mutability & Aliasing - volume fluctuates from 1m58s and becomes completely inaudible around 2m10s, Unresolved,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 9:20 am -04:00,In a more complex program it could be quite difficult to keep track of what has been aliased and wont this make it more likely that unintended consequences will occur?It seems to me this is a definite con. Can anyone suggest what a pro might be?Are there any tips for good programming practice for preventing confusion resulting from aliasing? (other than avoiding it altogether!)What do I do if I want to make a safety copy of a list?Thanks., Unresolved,1
Thursday October 3rd 2013 11:04 am -04:00,Yes thank you very much indeed to Jen and Paul and their splendid helpers.The lectures tests and assignments have all been clear concise and straightforward and the paraphernalia has been efficient and a pleasure to interact with. I took a book on Python programming out of my local library and kept renewing it for two years and never got past the introduction! Now thanks to this course I really feel as if Ive made a good start and got a solid footing to proceed onto further study., Unresolved,1
