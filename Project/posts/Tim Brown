Wednesday September 11th 2013 1:34 am -04:00,Remember you are defining the function at this point so you can use it later. You are just trying to write a return statement that returns a value that matches your type contract. In your example above you are trying to call the function within the function you are defining. Simply return the value of the math you are doing. Once you do that Save the file and hit f5 or Run->Run Module from the menu. This will then run your a1.py file and load in functions you are working on.You can then CALL the function you just made. The examples above are meant to be used at this point not as an example of what the body of the function should be. Just think of it this way... when something has the three >>> arrows that means you are RUNNING / USING your functions whereas when you are editing things in the a1.py you are DEFINING the functions so they can be RUN / CALLED from the python shell.Hope this helps connect the dots. So once you Save your a1.py file and Run->Run Module (f5) you will copy and paste the EXAMPLES they provided to TEST out whether you are returning the correct value. >>> seconds_difference(1800.0 3600.0)1800.0If you get the wrong value dont worry just think about your math and re-read the description to see if you have your math backward or what not.Â , Unresolved,0
