Friday August 23rd 2013 9:21 am -04:00,I did not know this: While working on the Exercise 1 I was entering a code and switching between windows. I accidentally pressed the Windows button and left tab button. A list of functions popped up. There must be a hundred of them right? Probably more. I look forward to learning more.Im sure that if youre a beginner youll find this interesting. Any experienced coders care to comment?,None,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 4:52 pm -04:00,I passed an argument using L where L = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]. Since this was my second time trying the homework the while_version functions tested for and odd number stopped on and even number. I had the same problem  as Bill the first time around. The second time I believe I found the right (one) answer. I only tested three for_version functions. Two of them looped the whole list (not sure if I said that correctly) and one stopped at the first even number., Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 4:56 pm -04:00,No disrespect to anyone else. This thread seems most relevant to my concern: Can someone please tell me why found_even worked in the for_version codes. Just by looking at them I did not believe that found_even would factor in and that it would return a NoneType because it was not a number which is what were trying to find. Is found_even a built-in function? Why did it make the difference?, Resolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 8:15 pm -04:00,If Ive learned anything I believe empty strings are set/defined in advance of an accumulator. A list can contain numbers or strings. Im sure you already knew that. Just trying to bounce some ideas around., Unresolved,0
