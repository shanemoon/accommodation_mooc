Friday October 4th 2013 12:58 am -04:00,Thank you!!!!!!  Ive been trying to get my PC to open the file for the past 1.5 hrs to no avail doing exactly what Paul suggested in his notes.  Your suggestion did the trick...I just copied my very first attempt changing all the back slashes to forward slashes and it worked right away.  It would be extremely helpful if this was added to the lecture notes.  PC users in the class would be so much happier!  Again thank you!, Resolved,1
