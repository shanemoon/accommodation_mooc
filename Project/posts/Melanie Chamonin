Saturday September 28th 2013 4:18 pm -04:00,I dont get it. I read every message dealing with updating_score but event after using the hints I found I still get the same error. TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: int and NoneTypeMy code is written like this : I use player_info[1] as a counter (without erasing the score that might be already registered) and I add the new score calculated with word_score(word). Is my error in update_score or word_score ?, Resolved,0
