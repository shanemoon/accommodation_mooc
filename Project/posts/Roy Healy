If from day 1 you have an awareness of how memory is handled and good documentation then you are more likely to continue with these in mind if you go further. If they were to skip these features then later on you will have difficulty trying to implement these good habits into your coding method., Resolved,4
Thursday September 12th 2013 5:59 pm -04:00,Yeah the autograder will mark you wrong if you take initiative and ensure that an empty string isnt considered a valid DNA sequence.I dunno if its some clever lesson about only meeting specifications or what but it really doesnt seem intuitive nor logical to treat no input as a valid input given the problem domain. The point of this code is to analyze and perform operations on valid DNA sequences; being unable to determine whether there is no input at all is a potential usability issue or even guaranteeing a future bug report.I felt so proud of myself of thinking to check what happens with a blank string and then making sure that the result would make sense turns out I was being too clever..., Resolved,3

Im still getting my histogram file as blank.I cant spot the error myself can someone else take a look and tell me if I am missing something?, Resolved,0
