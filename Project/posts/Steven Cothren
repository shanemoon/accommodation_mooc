Thursday October 3rd 2013 4:31 pm -04:00,I think I would save the Excel sheet as a CSV file. Then read the CSV in and use John McNameras XlsxWriter (https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter) to write out an Excel spreadsheet with the highlighting that you need. I use the Perl version of that module all the time and it is really easy for getting stuff done. I havent used the Python version but it looks like it has all of the same features.Note: There are modules around for reading a spreadsheet but Im not sure if there is one for Python 3.X yet. Plus doing it from CSV will likely be easier.,None,0
