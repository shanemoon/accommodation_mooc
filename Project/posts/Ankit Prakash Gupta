So the strings in print need to be passed as a parameter.def contains_even_number(l):	for elt in l:		if elt % 2 == 0:			print (list contains an even number)			break	else:		print (list does not contain an even number),None,0

Wednesday August 28th 2013 8:23 am -04:00,Python chooses the sign of the remainder to coincide with the divisor.Hence -5 % 4 = -1 (negative remainder) = 3 (positive remainder)5 % -4 = -1 (just the negative remainder), Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:36 pm -04:00,ya it was a mistake. thanks for pointing out.5 % -4 = 1(positive remainder) = -3 (negative remainder), Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:53 pm -04:00,for the irrational result I entered the complete floating point number result returned by IDLE. I had attempted the exercise twice and I got the answer to this question right both times.So for something like 13/7 enter the whole value 1.8571428571428572,None,1

Wednesday September 11th 2013 9:46 am -04:00,yes that interpretation did the trick for me., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 10:59 am -04:00,Look closely your function only checks the first character and decides the result as true or false. Try it with atcTCT and it will return false.So for AtcTGT in the first step char is A . The condition  if char in ATCG: is true and so you return True. The code does not checks the other characters.Remember the function execution stops as soon as a return statement is found.You need to make sure all the characters fullfill the condition and not just the first one., Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:27 am -04:00,get_complement requires a single nucleotide as input. You just need to return the complement nucleotide.Also check if the input is valid else return an empty string., Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 11th 2013 12:31 pm -04:00,Have you also removed the concatenation (+) operator? The assignment clearly states The first parameter is a nucleotide (A T C or G). Return the nucleotides complement. for get_complement. So if you are giving the input as ATCG you should not get TAGC as it violates the input condition.The conversion ATCG to TAGC should happen in get_complementary_sequence . , Unresolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 4:02 am -04:00,isdigit(...)    S.isdigit() -> bool        Return True if all characters in S are digits    and there is at least one character in S False otherwise.the not simply inverts the result returned by isdigit.So  the condition not char.isdigit()Returns False if all characters in char are digits and there is at least one character in char False otherwise., Resolved,1

Saturday October 5th 2013 2:25 am -04:00,\b is an escape sequence. Remember how in lectures on file handling we used the newline character  which is also a escape sequence. You can read more about escape sequences here.You can avoid it explicitly by using a double backslash likeboard_filename = C:\Python33\my programs\\board1.txtor you can always use the word r before the string without having to search for the escape sequences and having adding explicit backslashes. The word r preceding the string tells python to include backslashes as such.board_filename = rC:\Python33\my programs\board1.txtYou can try printing out board_filename  after you set it to see what happens to the string in the three cases and what filename you are actually passing to open()., Unresolved,0
