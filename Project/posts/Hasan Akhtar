Saturday August 31st 2013 8:26 pm -04:00,Hey Everyone.So Im having a little bit of trouble with the hours_difference function. My code for the function is:def hours_difference(time_1 time_2):     (number number) -> float    Return the number of hours later that a time in seconds    time_2 is than a time in seconds time_1.            >>> hours_difference(1800.0 3600.0)    0.5    >>> hours_difference(3600.0 1800.0)    -0.5    >>> hours_difference(1800.0 2160.0)    0.1    >>> hours_difference(1800.0 1800.0)    0.0    print(max(time_1 time_2) - min(time_1 time_2))When I save and run the module no errors are shown. However the Python shell gives this message:>>> ================================ RESTART ================================>>> Traceback (most recent call last):  File C:\Users\simba\Desktop\a1.py line 34 in <module>    print(max(time_1 time_2) - min(time_1 time_2))NameError: name time_1 is not defined>>> Also when I try to use the function in the shell this happens:>>> hours_difference(21)>>> It simply moves on to the next line without printing the difference in hours. Im not sure whats the problem. Help?P.S. Also when I try to replace print with return and run the module it gives me an error saying return outside of function. This may or may not have something to do with it, Resolved,0
