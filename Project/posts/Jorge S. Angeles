Friday August 30th 2013 3:40 pm -04:00,is it necessary to build three functions to get the hour minute and seconds of the elapsed time? i can build one function that can cover the hh:mm:ss of the elapsed time. please help me get cleared on this. i cannot improve my score because i made the get_seconds by just returning what was handed by the parameter., Resolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 6:07 pm -04:00,since it is required to make 3 functions to get hrs/mins/secs i used the example-parameters (3800/200/20) to validate each of the functions. 20secs cannot be computed anymore. if these functions are in one function minutes can be derived from the hour calculation; so does the seconds from the minutes computation. its like a cascading procedure. i am confused by the example given.    btw joao 3600secs is 1hr-0min-0sec. am wondering how u made that kind of A in ur name i didnt kno it cn b done., Resolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 8:05 pm -04:00,joao i used 3800 as parameter on all 3 functions. all worked well.  the score is still the same. am combing all code-lines. hope to improve it by due date.gracias for clarifying things out., Resolved,0

Sunday September 15th 2013 3:42 pm -04:00,i am just wondering if the autograder validate a print statement that is marked as a remark/descriptive line i. e. with # at the start of a command line. i tested some of the modules with a print statement then marked each print stmt with a # when tests are okay in IDLE runs., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 4:04 pm -04:00,i got 22/24. but i know it should be 24/24.  i thought maybe i solved the problems in a different way.  i do not mind autograders rating since i passed but with alexious comment now i mind. hey bro ur houston joke made my day. lol, Unresolved,1
