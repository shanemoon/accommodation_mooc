Friday October 4th 2013 7:07 am -04:00,the function is working when i use print and its printing all the words without . and the other problem is that i have used the while loop and its not breaking its running continuously what should i do to stop the loop and return the words when i use return function as it is just returning one word when i use it put print is returning all words. >>> read_words(open(c:/users/kali/Downloads/ltp/wordlist1.txt r))CRUNCHYCRUNCHYCOWSCRUNCHYCOWSEATCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEATGRASSCRUNCHYCOWSEAT.., Resolved,0
