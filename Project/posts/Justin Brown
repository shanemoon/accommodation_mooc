Friday August 30th 2013 5:40 pm -04:00,GreetingsI will try to make this a quick easy question for you.I enrolled quite late to the August 2013 offering for this course - August 29 2013 was when I found my email notification it was finally being offered again with the Instructor-Led option.Am I too late to earn proper accreditation for this course? To be clear I am NOT requesting an extension to the 1st Assignment which is due this coming Monday or any special-considerations of any kind - missing the email was my mistake and aside from that I dont think I will have any issues blasting through what Ive missed so far to catch up to the rest of the class. I just needed to be sure I didnt blow it this time around by arriving late to the party.I look forward to your reply.RegardsJustin Brown,None,0
