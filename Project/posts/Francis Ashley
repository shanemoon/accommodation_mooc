Sunday September 1st 2013 7:36 pm -04:00,So my assignment got marked and i got a measly 18 out of 41. This makes no sense because all my code works in the shell. Here is an example of question 5..[code removed]Can anyone tell me what im doing wrong?, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 8:06 pm -04:00,Thanks just starting focusing on //! I originally used it to begin within but then decided against it because it kept bring up a float. Lets say that i am passing through  >>> to_24_hour_clock(28.5)With this is get an answer of 4.0.get_hours = ((hours * 3600) // (3600)) % 24Whilst this gets 4. (also stuck the integer division in there too.) Surely with the new integer division the remainder is cancelled out before Round gets a chance to tamper with it?get_hours = about(((hours * 3600) // (3600)) % 24), Unresolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 8:11 pm -04:00,There are 3600 seconds in an hour =DI thought they were pretty simple but yes will try to make simpler. Is it fine to make an extra function which get_hour get_minute and get_second can call on? One to convert hours to seconds., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 8:13 pm -04:00,I think you just hit the nail on the head!, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 8:08 pm -04:00,Are you sure youre on the right forum? Ass2 isnt as up as far as i know dont you mean exercise 2?, Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 2:09 pm -04:00,In question five and six were asked to set up new functions. def to_24_hour_clock(hours):seams to be completely useless because I cant call functions further down the page (or can i?) So their is no way that i can output hhmmss without creating a NEW function below get_seconds and returning it there.time_to_utc(utc_offset time):Again were supposed to create 3 new functions with the SAME NAMES as the last three functions.. after writing this and putting it through the online marker my score went from 33 down to 18.Im so lost now.. this is the third full day running now on this assignment >.>any ideas?, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 9:25 am -04:00,Play around with // and % this is exactly what they are for ;), Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 9:51 am -04:00,// outputs an integer whilst % outputs the left over numbers from a division. In this case you will want to use %.here is a simple example... 61 % 60 = 1seconds_varable % hour_OR_minute_OR_second = ?If I go through the process with ;2548562457852156985632478963214 i might be making it a little to easy for the mods liking.Check python as a calculator  video in week one for everything you need to know.good luck, Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 9:21 am -04:00,I am trying to output the get_hours get_minutes and get_seconds functions from the to_24_hour_clock return statement. Like so..return get_hours get_minutes get_secondsall I get is (<function get_hours at 0x00F95660> <function get_minutes at 0x00F956A8> <function get_seconds at 0x00F95930>)How do i return the values for these functions? not those numbers whatever they might be?thanks, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 9:31 am -04:00,Boom! I forgot to call the function paremeters.. a simple fix of adding...get_hours(seconds) get_minutes(seconds) get_seconds(seconds)Yes seconds was created elsewhere.. thanks for jogging my mind :-), Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 10:57 am -04:00,With question 6 i am getting the error ERROR: TypeErrorunsupported operand type(s) for -: tuple and floatMy time_from_utc function inputs the utc_offset and time parameters. Adds them together divides and outputs the remainder to to_24_hour_clock(hours) which calculates the values and returns them back through the time_from_utc function.It all works fine in the shell but gets marked as an error when uploaded hmmm?, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:23 am -04:00,Hey the only thing that i changed was the return statement to indicate that the function calls were.. well.. functions (in yes the to_24_hour_clock function return statement).hence beforereturn get_hours get_minutes get_secondsafterreturn get_hours(seconds) get_minutes(seconds) get_seconds(seconds)I dont quite understand what the problem is? It would probably make more sense if i could post the whole code for Q5 and Q6.. but that is against the honor code., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:40 am -04:00,Looks like that could be the root of the issue.. I didnt know return hours % 24even existed.. i must have deleted days ago now. , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 11:44 am -04:00,That simple change boosted my grade from 33 to 41 THANKS! =D, Resolved,1
Monday September 9th 2013 9:38 am -04:00,Hi guys can anyone recommend a list of problems to practice on? Currently working through the Mind Food challenges; but itd be nice to have something to work on afterwards.I found this website online projecteuler which seamed to fit the bill perfectly.. until my brain imploded due to the complexity of some of the questions and lack of skills to execute.Just looking for problems to work on that are up to the point of what we have learnt.. eg: If/Else/While Functions variables.. etcThe clock problem in assignment was spot on in terms of what im looking for.Thankyoonz,None,0
