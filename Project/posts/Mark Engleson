Tuesday September 24th 2013 7:39 am -04:00,I ran the code with the test sequence in the assignment and it worked. Why am I not getting credit?Am I allowed to post my (apparently failing) code for critique?, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 9:31 am -04:00,I thought Id set up that kind of string and the test succeeded.def get_complemetary_sequence(dna):    (str) ->    The parameter is a DNA sequence.Return the DNA sequence that is    complementary to the given DNA sequence.    >>>get_complemetary_sequence(AT)    TA        complement =     for char in dna:        if char == A:            complement = complement + T        elif char == T:            complement = complement + A        elif  char == C:            complement = complement + G        elif char == G:            complement = complement + C        else:            return Not valid!        return dna + complement    Note - I set up the Else case to cover someone putting in screwball input.  Is that what messed it up?, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 11:18 am -04:00,When I tried using my get_complement() inside the for_loop it only kicked out the first character of the complement sequence.  How do I modify it so it returns so the complement of the entire string?, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 12:17 pm -04:00,Oh I shouldve written get_complement differently..., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 12:28 pm -04:00,Ive got it now!  Thanks!, Resolved,0
