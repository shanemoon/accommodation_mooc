Wednesday August 28th 2013 1:24 am -04:00,Hi-The purpose of print (or any derivative) is to output the evaluated expression to the output. In IDLEs case: the console or cli or whatever you want to call it.-The purpose of return is to return the evaluated expression to the caller. Considerdef randomfunc(x):  // this function will return the provided number (x) + 1    return x+1returnvalue = randomfunc(2) //This would mean returnvalue points to 3. We havent seen 3 yet thoughprint(returnvalue) // This will display 3 in the console.In essence return will provide the evaluated expression to the caller so it can continue its function. It may take many function calls and return values before the end user even sees it (through use of print), Resolved,4
Wednesday August 28th 2013 9:24 am -04:00,As Janine said as soon as a function hits a return statement it will evaluate the expression and return it to the caller. No statements will be processed after that. So just need to reorder:def sum2(num1 num2):    print(hello)    return num1 + num2    print(goodbye) #Note that this will never be called because its unreachable due to the return statementresult = sum2(13)print(result), Resolved,0
