Tuesday September 17th 2013 5:00 am -04:00,I like the colours that the shell uses for the python programs but when I print the program out it uses notepad and comes out in black and white.How do I print out my programs in the colours that the shell uses please?,None,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 5:50 am -04:00,Thanks that works but is very clumsy surely theres a better way?  If the program is over several pages like the assignments then that method is not practical.,None,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 7:49 am -04:00,Due to the lack of an answer I infer that this is not a trivial problem.  Surely someone knows how to do it?Please help.Note:  I have found a way to do it still not perfect though:Download Notepad++Open the .py files with notepad++The colours are wrong (ie different to the IDLE colours) but are customisable. And I can now print out the program code in colour,None,1
Saturday September 28th 2013 5:14 am -04:00,Im unable to test my read_board function because I cant get visualizer to  work with an open command.  What is wrong with this?  The program hangs at line 2 with the following error.1file=board1.txt2board_file = open(filer)NameError: name open is not defined, Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 8:35 am -04:00,Thanks I managed to do it without testing but would have liked to have used the visualizer.  Never mind. Thanks again - I thought I was doing something wrong.  I wasted over an hour on that., Resolved,0
