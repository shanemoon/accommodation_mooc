Monday September 9th 2013 9:19 am -04:00,I am stuck on get_seconds .. I dont know why ... I managed to solve everything else just not able to solve the example and get 20 as a result. I get 200 as a result but thats how many total seconds are left and I dont know how to get that number to 20. Because there are 60 seconds in a minute there are 3 full minutes in 200 seconds. There are 20 seconds remaining.Im able to get the 200 but not able to figure out how to get that 20! grrr so frustrating :( This is what Im not able to solve:  >>> get_seconds(3800)    20, Unresolved,0
