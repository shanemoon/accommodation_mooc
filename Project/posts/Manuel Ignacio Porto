Thursday August 29th 2013 12:08 pm -04:00,Miguel the purpose of the to_24_hour_clock function is to tell you how many hours have passed since midnight while in the get_hours function you get an amount of hours equal to the seconds you entered. So you have the amount of hours that have passed but you need to know how many hours since midnight is that. The to_24_hour_clock function returns the remainder of the division between the amount of hours (ex. 25) and 24 (a day). That remainder (1 hour) is the quantity of hours spent since midnight.PS: Sorry for my english, Resolved,2

Also your print statement is wrong that colon is wrong placed. The expression should be like this:def addition(number1 number2):    print(number1 + number2)addition(13) You directly call the addition function (you can also create a variable with this call but it would not print anything till you call that variable)4, Resolved,0
