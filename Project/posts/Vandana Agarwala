Saturday September 14th 2013 1:25 pm -04:00,My answer was:s1.find(s2 (s1.find(s2) + len(s2) - 1))I dont understand why that is incorrect because I tested it out on other examples as well and it always gave me the correct answer., Resolved,0

Thats going to begin looking at the spot where it finds the first occurrence of s2 - and basically just find the same one again so it says the second occurrence of s2 is at the same place as the first (and therefore that there are always two of them even when there actually is only one.).  You want it to start looking AFTER that spot.Hope that helped and wasnt confusing! :P, Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 12:11 pm -04:00,Yes but do you agree with my second point - that his beginning point will not work?  At first my code was very similar to his; then I tested it and found out why it doesnt work., Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 1:51 pm -04:00,Ohhh Im so sorry I didnt catch the +1!! Yeah then its probably the first reason as I think youre also not supposed to use any functions other than find() (so not len() ).  Again Im so sorry!!, Resolved,0
