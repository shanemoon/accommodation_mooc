Sunday September 15th 2013 9:42 am -04:00,Hello Ning in your code which you have mention before like str.count(A + T + C + G) is same as str.count(ATCG) because there is concatenation in str.count(A + T + C + G) and python takes it as a whole ATCG. In order to resolve count_nucleotide() function you need count how many times a letter occurs in a given dna. For example in ATCCGT: there are 2 Cs and therefore count_nucleotide(ATCCGT C) should return 2.Hope this helps..., Unresolved,1
Sunday September 15th 2013 9:55 am -04:00,No its not. Please re-read the instructions. It mentioned clearly Return the number of occurrences of nucleotide in the DNA sequence. Occurences mean number of times a letter occured in a given string., Unresolved,0

Saturday September 14th 2013 10:32 am -04:00,The return statement actually breaks the code. So you need to check that atleast all the characters are checked before returning a boolean. Please use Python visualizer to get better understanding how the execution goes through the code!, Unresolved,0

Friday September 20th 2013 8:11 am -04:00,Well I have googled about it.. It says that slicing works in a way such that the indices are like pointing between the characters - with left edge of first character numbered 0 and right edge of first character numbered 1 and so on.... For example:        |  Z  |  Y  |  M  |  U  |  G  |  R  |  Y  |       0     1     2     3     4      5     6     7Therefore s[2:2] means starting from edge numbered 2 till edge numbered 2 gives empty string  , Unresolved,3

Saturday September 21st 2013 6:43 am -04:00,No I dont think both the codes are the same. Given that found_even = false (already mentioned in the code) and calling for_version([1234])In code 1:     It will return 4(1+3) because all odd numbers will go into if block and even numbers will go into else block. Even though found_even is assigned true in else block it doesnt affect the loop as there is no condition for checking found_even variable.In code 2:    It will return 1 because when num = 1 the if block is executed. But if num = 2 the else block is executed and therefore found_even = true. And if num = 3 the if block doesnt execute.... Thats because found_even = true and the condition not found_even means false and hence it returns 1...Hope this helps...., Unresolved,1
