Change the last line to read as follows and it will display the result.print (convert_to_fahrenheit(int(input(Enter something: )) ))You could also assign the function call to a variable and then print the variable.Also you can start a new thread by clicking on the Start New Thread button which is on the page where it displays all the topics. The button is located just above the list of current topics., Resolved,0

Do not use addition subtraction or parentheses ( ) (brackets [ ] are required).I answered this question which was marked wrong but evaluated correctly in the Shell. I used only negative indices. All other restrictions were followed. Of course I cannot provide the answer here. My score on this attempt would have been 100% if it had not been for this., Resolved,0

Negative indices can be thought of as if you were shifting the index to the left from the first element and rotating counter-clockwise through the last element. This can therefore be thought of as a pointer and not math. I can only guess that the reason that these problems say that math should not be used is that they do not want any calculations performed such as using the len() function to in any way determine the pointer value. The idea is to teach how to access a list in this manner using only a pointer whether it be positive or negative. The other idea here also may be to indicate the simplicity in which the element may be accessed. It may be true in some real applications that math may be required to access the desired element., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 11:08 pm -04:00,One thing to remember with While loops is that any variables that are in the condition must be set before executing the While instruction the first time. If the condition is False upon the first execution then the body of the While instruction will never be run. If it is True then it will be run and the the While condition will be checked again.Here is an example where you will see that you have to initialize the variable val. It will enter the While loop in the first check and the body of the While loop will be processed. It will then loop back on the While until the the condition val < 5 is true. Not that it will not enter the body of the While when val = 5. The value of five will actually be printed outside the loop.list = [12345]index = 0val = list[index]while val < 5:    print (val)    index = index + 1    val = list[index]print (End loop)print (val)Here is another example where it will never enter the body of the While loop. The initial value of val will be 5. When val is checked on the first conditional check it will equate to False. Execution will then continue at the instruction that prints End Loop.list = [12345]index = len(list)-1val = list[index]while val < 5:    print (val)    index = index + 1    val = list[index]print (End loop)print (val),None,0
