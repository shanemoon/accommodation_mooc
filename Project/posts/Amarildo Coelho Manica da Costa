Monday August 19th 2013 4:53 pm -04:00,Actually x is a variable and a variable refers or points to a value (and a program needs to keep track of the data or values stored by these variables so they assign them a memory address) according to the explanations on the lecture video regarding the variables. For better understanding I advise you to review the video lecture about variables and pay attention to the drawing regarding variable memory address and value. ,None,3
Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:10 am -04:00,I guess one of the division statement refer to a floating point number as result and the other (//) refers to an integer number as result instead (i.e 2/3=0.66666666666 while 2//3=0)., Resolved,1
Tuesday August 20th 2013 6:44 am -04:00,Its not valid. Maybe the question was to check for non-valid python names.,None,0

Wednesday August 21st 2013 12:16 pm -04:00,Yes i agree. So do you guys have any extra exercises to keep us practising and consolidating the material weve been given so far?!,None,0

Tuesday August 20th 2013 7:29 am -04:00,I guess this is due to the types provided by python. This is a floating point number and not a real number floating point numbers are approximated to real numbers or somenthing like that., Resolved,1

Tuesday August 20th 2013 8:57 am -04:00,In the first case scenario in the 1st and 2nd lines x and x1 are variables that are passes as arguments in the 3rd line where the function is called.In the second case scenario x and x1 they are parameters for they are given in a function definition in line 1 as for line 4 the numbers 1 and 2 are indeed arguments for they are passed in the function call. As for line 2 and 3 they are simply variables that points to a value in this casa 1 and 2.Hope that was helpfull!, Resolved,5
Tuesday August 20th 2013 9:50 am -04:00,Hi Michiel I guess thats becouse the operation itself is done as a common division (resulting on a floating point number) although the result of it displays only the integer part of the whole number (i.e 8.9 / 6.7 = 1.328358... but because of the operator // it displays only the integer par which is 1)., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 10:01 am -04:00,Thanks for noticing. I guess that happens because theyre both float point numbers. If they were integers the result would be a full integer number with no decimals attached., Resolved,2

Tuesday August 20th 2013 4:39 pm -04:00,Parameters are the ones you in the middle of the parentesis on a function definition.I.e :def product(ab):     x = a*b     return x // in this case a and b are parameters for they are being used as attributes in the definition of th                 e function productArguments are the ones in the middle of the parenthesis on a function call (they can be variables or numbers you simply pass to them) i.e:>>>help(round) // in this case round is an argument in the function help>>>min(28)   // also 2 and 8 are arguments of the function min.Note that these values are introduced by the userHope this helped!),None,2
Wednesday August 21st 2013 6:37 am -04:00,This puzzle is for us to define the functions on our own? And can submit it for your evaluation too as long as we try to solve it?,None,0
Wednesday August 21st 2013 8:54 am -04:00,Hello again here is the link to my attemp of the exercise. I would appreciate if could comment arround it in case its wrong so i can make the appropriate changes to it.http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=%23+Puzzle+%231+Template+by+Alexander+B.(Beleno)+Falgui%0...Cheers!,None,1
Wednesday August 21st 2013 5:20 pm -04:00,I liked that idea on the root function. Very nice thinking although Alexander here has a more efficient code.When are you going to show us your answer code?,None,0
Wednesday August 21st 2013 6:15 pm -04:00,The idea of using exponentiation in your codes was good made your codes more light and simple. But its too ease to do it that way I thought this exercise was for us to give more of ideas around these topics.Just saying!,None,0
Thursday August 22nd 2013 2:41 pm -04:00,Hello LTP mates hope youre all doing good practising and consolidating the week 1 lesson given so far.Do you guys think you can handle writting a pyg latin game code? It covers some topics not yet lectured in the course like if statement for loop string manipulation boolean type. I mean are you up to the challenge? ,None,0
Thursday August 22nd 2013 3:10 pm -04:00,A game that takes the 1st letter of a word and puts it as last. (i.e dog --> ogd) and adds a ay staying like this ogday. but you have to make sure that the first letter of the same word becomes is a vowel if not it puts these letters last until the 1st one is a vowel Ex: browser --> owserbr + ay --> owserbray.Go to wikipedia to understand more. ,None,1

Wednesday August 21st 2013 11:22 am -04:00,Hi I like programmingused to do it when i had free time couple of years ago. Now Im rusty so i hope to refresh it here with this course. I understand a little bit of Pascal and C++.Hope to better my knowledge in here with you guys. So lets share ideas!,None,0
Wednesday August 21st 2013 10:58 am -04:00,Maybe you should check the spelling in your code. You might have written the height parameter diffrently from the one you use when you calculate the area  (i.e def area(heightbase); area=(heigth*base)/2). This may result in a NameError message for height <> heigth. Check it out!, Resolved,0

Wednesday August 21st 2013 6:29 pm -04:00,You clearly mixed things up. Its something like this:Memory for the purposes of this course will be considered a very long list of storage locations.Each of these storage locations (in the list) has an unique ID number which its called memory address.To keep track of these numbers programs use variables which are known to be a named location in the memory .Every value we enter is assigned a location in the memory this is done by python automaticaly. And this location (storage) has its ID so the variable assigned that value can keep track of it. That why we say a variable refers or points toa value  because what they really  contain is the memory address that the value has.Hope this enlights you a bit!Cheers, Resolved,0
