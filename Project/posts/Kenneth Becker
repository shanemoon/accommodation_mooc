Sunday August 25th 2013 7:47 pm -04:00,In the explanation section of the exercise questions you state Note that the question just asks for a value so dont include any other information other than the value. I understand fully that a value is being asked for. What type of other information are people including in the answers that would cause the need to make this statement? (being new to this Im just curious),None,0

From the FAQ for this assignment they stated:The is operator is the object identity operator it most likely does NOT behave the way you think it does. If you use it in your code and you cant figure out why your functions are failing this is probably the reason.  Use the equality == operator instead. I was having the same problem till I replaced is with == in my get_complement sequence.Hope that helps!, Unresolved,2
