Monday August 26th 2013 3:14 pm -04:00,Hi everybody;Id like to know how long a file name in Python can be. I know the safe format is 8.3. But I need to make my files longer than 8 characters. Otherwise theyre very cryptic.Thank you very much, Resolved,0

Tuesday August 27th 2013 10:15 pm -04:00,I was testing triple quotes in Python as below>>> Test = I say:Imtesting triple quotes>>> TestI say:I\m testing triplequotes** Why did Python automatically insert character \ in its display?I restarted the shell and retyped exactly the same thing. Same problem. I got no error message.Thank you, Resolved,0

Monday September 2nd 2013 1:00 pm -04:00,Hello everybody; I can’t finish time_from_utcfunction in step 6 of this assignment. It’s because I don’t know how to solveit in “human terms”.  If I knew it I could translate it into Pythoncode with much ease and on my own. Could somebody please explainin “human language” the steps to solve this problem? I don’t need to be told whatPython code looks like. I can translate from “human language” to Python on myown. Thank you very much. Below are things I think Iknow and where I got stumped. Please give me some explanation if I’m wrong or Idon’t know what to do. 1. The assignment has two objectives.They are:1.1. to convert a given timein any time zone to the corresponding time in UTC+0 zone in 24 hours format. 1. 2.To convert a given timein UTC+0 zone to a corresponding time in any other time zone in 24 hoursformat. 2. We’re learning Pythonfundamentals. We have to use the half-written functions given to us by theinstructors. We are not allowed to use statements that have not been taught atthis stage of the course. For example we can’t use IF statement.  3. This is where I got stumped. To solve the problempresented by time_from_utc I think I need to use the formula Local_time  = UTC+0_time  +  Offset time ****If my formula is WRONG please tell me what I need to use to convert the time? AgainI just need the solution in “human language”. I don’t need to be told whatPython code for this solution looks like. Thank you very much. Imanually used this function to test the examples given in this function. Itworked until I reached the two examples below given by the instructors Example: 3.1.  time_from_utc(-7 6.0)    23.0  Example 3.2 time_from_utc(-1 0.0)    23.0Difficulty with example 3.1Here  my formula yielded result -1. The instructors areright to state that the time is 23.0.  But how can I get therewithout using Python statements that I have not been taught? Difficulty with example 3.2 Here  my formula yielded result -1. The instructors areright to state that the time is 23.0.  But how can I get therewithout using Python statements that I have not been taught? Thank you very much for yourhelp and time., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 4th 2013 11:32 pm -04:00,In video 5 of week 3 titled If statements instructor Campbell tells us we represent 24 hours in float. For example: 14:30 p.m. is represented as 14.5. Thats good. But how can I represent 14:37 p.m. in float?All of her examples do not cover this matter.Id like to know this so that later when I test my function I can pass the float value of 14:37 p.m.I know we are learning Python fundamentals but how can I know the function I wrote is giving correct result with all the situations regarding time?  Thats why I need to know how to represent an odd 24 hours time in float.Thank you very much for your help and time., Resolved,0

Let’s saywe want to extract sub string ‘Program” from it. Letter P has index 9. Letter mhas index 15.If we type s[9:15]then we’ll get ‘Progra’ because ending index is EXCLUSIVE.
