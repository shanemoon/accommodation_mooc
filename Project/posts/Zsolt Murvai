Saturday August 24th 2013 7:57 pm -04:00,I thought it was a bug for another reason. Why would 4** be a syntax error when in the example of the missing closing parenthesis Python kept on waiting for it after hitting Enter? That latter example led me to believe Python only interprets an instruction as an error if there is no further chance to complete it validly. How is 4** different from (4 + 5 * 3 ? In other words why does P. differentiate between a missing closing parenthesis and a missing operand (that can still be provided meaningfully)?, Resolved,0
