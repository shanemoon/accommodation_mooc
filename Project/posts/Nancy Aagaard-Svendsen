Monday September 2nd 2013 5:16 pm -04:00,With all due respect Adrian for an expert like yourself things may be easily ignored so you can focus on the valid parts of the questions. Most of us are beginners. You have to remember that. We dont eat sleep and breathe programs. We have to find what the valid part of the questions are through scrutinizing the questions. We dont know whats ok to throw out and what we should keep. Thats why for us ALL the question is valid. It is not Tolunay making this complicated the exercises do that completely on their own. It may not be complicated for YOU but you arent a student trying to learn programming. , Resolved,1
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 8:21 am -04:00,Perhaps he is not an expert Jen but I dont find help or comfort in phrases like I think you are unnecessarily complicating this  dont have to concern yourself with how it does this I approach things with a logical mind (and dare I say it a modicum of common sense!) and my favourite Pity you didnt report it two days ago then isnt it?. That last one sounds rather condescending if you ask me. But what do I know. Maybe that just how Adrian talks to people. My bad.That being said both of you missed my point completely so lets back track a bit. For someone who is not used to programming we dont know what short cuts to take. We dont know what information is important and what information we can ignore. So saying Dont concern yourself with how it does this we have to concern us. Thats how we understand. You have taken this course before and did so well they asked you back. ERGO you know more than most of us. So how about talking to us in a way even beginners can understand? Hope my comment is acceptable now.Edit - Pity you didnt report it two days ago then isnt it? is apparently taken out of context. The TA deleted the comment it was referring to. Sorry., Resolved,1
Tuesday September 3rd 2013 9:15 am -04:00,Thank you for dumbing it down. Im gonna see if I can wrap my itty bitty head around it. , Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 5:32 pm -04:00,I agree. I think the instructors need to remember that although they are experts in using these programs most of the students are not. I dont feel Im learning anything if I cant even get the same window to open as the instruction video. Then the video becomes useless., Resolved,1
Sunday September 1st 2013 6:39 pm -04:00,Thanks Nick. Unfortunately were not talking about what you think were talking about so... dont know what to do with that.  :-), Resolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 5:03 pm -04:00,I dont think I see anywhere in his comment that he called you smug. Are you just confrontational?, Unresolved Locked,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 5:06 pm -04:00,See how easy that was? Thank you Karl. Actual legitimate help without smugness. It can be done. Joseph you didnt ask for too much so ignore the immature downvotes. Theyre about as valid as the people who are giving them to you. I guess some feel if they dont have the upper hand they have nothing., Unresolved Locked,-3
Friday September 6th 2013 8:40 am -04:00,The forum started just fine. What you are offended over is that you feel personally attacked by Josephs comment about smugness. I guess it hit too close to home. Just to inform you he is completely correct. It is mentioned in several thread not just this one. So instead of attacking Joseph perhaps you should give him his right to post his opinion. I mean we are forced to listen to yours!, Unresolved Locked,-1
Friday September 6th 2013 8:44 am -04:00,So you join the forum to tell the TA how to do his job? Thats not smug at all is it?, Unresolved Locked,-1
Monday September 2nd 2013 6:08 pm -04:00,Sorry to see you go!, Unresolved Locked,-2
Friday September 6th 2013 8:34 am -04:00,Smug down vote # 1. Do I look like I care? Im still right and youre still smug. , Unresolved Locked,0
Friday September 6th 2013 8:37 am -04:00,BTW does it help that Im not anonymous? Does that give you courage to back up your little down vote with an actual intelligent comment?, Unresolved Locked,0
Friday September 6th 2013 9:00 am -04:00,Are you for real? You dont hear the arrogance dripping off your words? First off you assume I/we need help. You know what you are when you ASSume right?? Im done my assignment and I dont know about Joseph but considering that he DIDNT ask for help I dont think he needs your help either. The way I read his comment which would be word for word not filling in what Im too lazy to read with my own words hes not asking for help. Hes talking about the arrogance and smugness in these forums. Every time you post something whether its as Bruno or as Anonymous you prove him right. The only thing Im going to ask you nicely is... oh wait I cant say that nicely. Never mind. SMH, Unresolved Locked,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 3:29 pm -04:00,I understand one must follow the honour code. That is very important. However is it possible you could answer Anons question because Im having the same problem. Thousands of thanks! :-), Unresolved,0

Friday September 20th 2013 3:23 pm -04:00,Im doing the invideo quiz and have a little trouble understand the logic in the answers to the questions. Please help me understand.In one question we are asked to find the es and to do so we needed to remember that the first index spot is represented by a 0. However in the next question we are to spell Call. So with the previous logic we start with C=0 a=1 l=2 and l=3. So tell me why is s[0:3] wrong? Thank you in advance for any help. Of course I can move on but moving on without understanding the premises behind all this is a waste of education. :-), Unresolved,-1
Friday September 20th 2013 3:38 pm -04:00,OK thank you. Ill just have to remember that. There isnt much logic in this stuff is there?  Thank you very much for your fast response. :-), Unresolved,-1
Friday September 20th 2013 4:07 pm -04:00,Yes!! This is exactly what I need. My brain doesnt work like this. Im smart enough (not a genius but I get by) get good grades and such but I often feel like Im getting by on my memory instead of actually understanding. I look forward to getting a deeper look into this book but I thank you for sharing. :-), Unresolved,-1
Monday September 30th 2013 12:05 pm -04:00,According to my INTERNET clock I still had 3 minutes left to hand in my paper. It showed that I didnt have time. I have a screenshot proving that this is true. Since my computer (and every other clock in my house) is regulated by the internet why cant I submit my paper? Its not my fault your clocks dont match the WORLD WIDE WEB., Unresolved Locked,-11
Monday September 30th 2013 3:19 pm -04:00,It doesnt matter when I left it to as long as I submitted it before the deadline. Whats the point of posting a deadline if you have to submit 5 minutes before that time ?, Unresolved Locked,-4
Monday September 30th 2013 4:01 pm -04:00,Im not bothered by the downvotes Rob. Its just a childish way to show that theyre challenged by our intelligence. They cant find anything relevant to say but they still want to be part of the thread. They dont have the guts to troll because the posts can be reported so they downvote instead. , Unresolved Locked,0

Monday September 30th 2013 3:30 pm -04:00,Excuse me for asking Alain but why would I do that? Are you staff? TA? Do you work for Coursera?, Unresolved Locked,0
Monday September 30th 2013 3:56 pm -04:00,Ah but Alian you are mistaken. You see although this may qualify as a public forum this thread was made for contacting the Coursera website to report issues such as technical issues which is what Im having. Since you are not qualified to help me in any way I dont see any need or desire to share my screenshot with you. Now go troll someone else. , Unresolved Locked,-4
Monday September 30th 2013 4:23 pm -04:00,Hi Chrissie. No you downvoted me because thats what you always do to my comments. Thats why I reported you earlier in this course. Or did you forget that? Maybe I should let them know youre at it again. As for the attitude I post a question and get downvotes and nasty comments and am forced to make another thread and you say I have attitude? You need a reality check.Alain again let me remind you that the name of this section of the forum is called Coursera Website (including technical issues). Obviously this is where Coursera wants me to post these issues. If that bothers you then perhaps you should contact Coursera. But thank you so much for your help., Unresolved Locked,-5
Monday September 30th 2013 4:54 pm -04:00,Chrissie @ had stuff removed? Nice try. If any of my comments are removed its me that removed it. Secondly I didnt say I was going to report you. I reminded you that we have met but like last time you are twisting my words to suit your need for attention. Go ahead. If this is all you have in life I wouldnt want to take it away. :-)  Robert I was before deadline both on my own clock as well as Courseras clock. I have sent them the screenshot and am waiting to hear back since these forums are only for show. Its a playground for the mentally insane and I have no use for that. Im here for an education not for a popularity contest. Ive kind of gotten past that phase in my life. Good news is if they let me submit they should let you submit as well.  :-)  Thanks for the support. See Chrissie. You want me to talk respectfully to you you talk respectfully to me. Its simple really.   , Unresolved Locked,-1
