Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:34 pm -04:00,Check your contains_sequence function for the source of the error.I had the same issue but I realized that for str.find a value of 0 should produce True (when dna2 is at the beginning of dna1). Therefore you may have to modify your greater than integer value., Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 11th 2013 6:16 pm -04:00,What exactly is the error on the grader? Does it give an explanation? Is it still test_a2.TestContainsSequence.test_contains_sequence_at_beginning failure like you mentioned in your first post? When I got that error I only needed to modify the contains_sequence function not the insert_sequence function., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 6:42 pm -04:00,Since the error only refers to ContainsSequenceÂ  that likely means that your insert_sequence function is fine. Try modifying your contains_sequence function. If it looks anything like mine all you have to do is modify the integer value using Thomass hint below. Make sure this returns True:contains_sequence(ATCGGC AT), Unresolved,1
