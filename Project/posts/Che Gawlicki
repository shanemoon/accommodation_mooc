Wednesday September 4th 2013 7:07 pm -04:00,Im having an if statement issue please help if you can>in idle i have an inelegant solution for the time_from_utc      if time + utc_offset >= 24.0:        return 24.0 - (time + utc_offset)    elif time + utc_offset < 0 :        return 24.0 + (time - (time + utc_offset)    else:        return time + utc_offsetand it errors tlling me else is invalid syntaxso i tried two ifs and an elsesame errorso i tried writing three ifs  if time + utc_offset >= 24.0:        return 24.0 - (time + utc_offset)    elif time + utc_offset < 0 :        return 24.0 + (time - (time + utc_offset)    if 0.0 < time + utc_offset > 24.0 :        return time + utc_offset    and it return error invalid syntax bad input :    referencing the last coloni submitted my code and recieved a zero as the program connot run even though every other function is resolved...help?    , Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 8:33 pm -04:00,thank you and i will try that but have you any idea why it is telling me else is a syntax error, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 8:42 pm -04:00,I did the call to clock (which i must have missed in the documentation..no surprise(on my part)) and yes it is much simpler thank you. But it trying to understand if else statements i still have not idea why that other code did not work., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 9:21 pm -04:00,hi i just went through something similar. I test each method and they worked individually but my very last line had a syntax error . and as it was my second attempt i received a score less than my original. But never fear it seems youre allowed a lot of attempts. what is your error?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 9:24 pm -04:00,oh and I guess part of the lesson here is bad code is still better than broken code lol. as it will grad you on your errors and successes. but only if it runs. , Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 2:05 pm -04:00,you dont want a static range(ie range(04) as the code needs to adapt to longer words and more lines(longer columns/rows) for the actual game . your problem is probably still in board_contains_word_in_columnif you started you for loop the same as board_contains_word_in_rowwith column_index swapped for row_index like this examplefor column_index in range(len(board)):it will not workyou need to define the range as to how long your row may actual be  no matter how many lines or words you are given. fortunately you have a function that makes worlds which you can than len the length of. all you need do is assign range() to the length of the word given by the function  make_str_from_?(remember needs two arguments the second is the index)so range(len(function_you_already_have)), Unresolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 2:20 pm -04:00,moving straight into functions is rough. some things just dont make sense believe me I hear you and whats worse is you are probably so close and the little things just arent quit sitting right. python seem to run a tight ship as far as syntax is concern(as to all programming languages I suspect). this site really helped me and with out it I would be lost here unfortunate to learn enough too be useful here will take you a week or more but it is an awesome sitehttp://www.codecademy.com/tracks/pythonbut once you spend the time at that site you will have a waaaaaayyyy easier time. I am a complete beginner minus that site and two others that were way over my head. that one helped the most. while this is course is still for beginners(which is why im here) it helps to have a little practice with the functions. like calling a function in a function had me messed up for like ever.   http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_loops.htm is also great for examples but i can never seem to find what i want on the sites search bar but if I google search something like python append and look for tutorialspoint in the results it always has helped me.Good Luck familiarity helps so each time is a little closer. , Unresolved,1
Monday September 30th 2013 2:47 pm -04:00,you cant change a list that wayyou need to either remove the item at player_info index[1] which is the old score and then append or extend the new score. this is how lists work. alternately you can use a replace command. but you need to know how to use append pop replace extend etc.. I believe there are videos that would help with that. , Unresolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 12:56 pm -04:00,Im not sure you need to make it so complicated. as far as i understand a3_driver.py opend the file for you and names it words_file. you dont need to open it your self. you need to read it by creating a for loop and remove all the  endtags.  thats it. you dont need to check for upper. again its been done for you. (or so it seems correct me if im wrong)in def read_words(words_file):all you need do ismake a variable to store a new lstcreate a for loop that checks items in the original list provide you in the argument words_file:find a way to remove the  tags from the end and store the new item in the new list. (append extend etc(remember how to slice a word?))return the new list., Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 5:55 pm -04:00,its painful  know believe me. you can test the code by writing a file opener for board1 and passing read_board the argument. , Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 6:01 pm -04:00,the code i offered early will get you some of the way but not all the way to 37/37 these two posts helped me grasp the logic immensely. for your read_words all you need to do is use .rstrip() to remove the newline character from the line variable before you append to the list and you append the line variable you create in your for loop not the words_file variable so fix these errors and read_words will work your read board need more work but is very close to working    inner_list =   # you need this line but it is in the wrong place move it to spot 1 below    outer_list =     for i in board_file:         # spot 1 is here  this will make the inner list empty before the start of the second          # loop that way you dont have the leftovers from the first line in this list         # spot 2 you are missing one other thing here you need to use .rstrip() before you         # make the inner list reassign the i variable like so        # i = i.rstrip() and that will solve the newline problem        # spot 3 the first for loop reads the line for you and         # the variable i has the current line stored in it so        #  change current_line to i and delete the line in spot 4           for j in current_line:  #<<-- change current_line to i               inner_list.append(j)          # spot 4 delete the below line is will only cause you big problems the first for loop does this        # as I explained above #       current_line = board_file.readline()  # <<--         outer_list.append(inner_list)    return outer_list by Tom EnosI have now revised my code.  I still seem to get the same output as the two above but I now get no errors on the automaker.My new code goes line by line in board_file and for each line uses .rstrip() to ensure that newline was removed from the line.  For each line the code goes letter by letter appending each letter in the line to a list.  Each list is then appended to an overall list. I hope this helps those who have been struggling like me. by anonymous from https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/search?q=read_words#2-state-query=read_words, Resolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 12:26 pm -04:00,really not sure. All I can say is I have the exact same code as you minus the else: clause. mine simply returns false at the end of the while loop if the true condition is not met. then I ran it with your code(else: included) and absolutely no problem occurred. which means the problem could be some where else? , Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 12:49 pm -04:00,https://www.udacity.com/ has an excellent open pace course for beginners that I was in the middle of before this. You are programming a search engine so it uses a lot of slicing and for loops. very similar material just taking further.  It got a bit heady for me towards the middle where I then found this site http://www.codecademy.com which is also open pace and very thorough and very easy to grasp. a bit slow for unit one as it assumes you Know nothing. so between the two theres a lot to learn and do. Then coursera has a course An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python starting in 3 days. I took it before and had some distributions in my personal life in the last three weeks so couldnt keep up it got beyond me. however it was my first ever course and was very good I plan on taking it again so that i may finish it this time. I also found these site and would recommend them for readingCode Like a Pythonista: Idiomatic Python (this one s awesome very informative)Dive Into Python,None,1
