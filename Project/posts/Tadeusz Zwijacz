Sunday August 25th 2013 2:36 am -04:00,I have the same problem and I cant resolve it:>>> def f(x):    return x ** 2f(3)SyntaxError: invalid syntax>>> f(x):    SyntaxError: invalid syntax>>> def f(x):    return x**2f(3)SyntaxError: invalid syntax>>> def f(x):    return x ** 2result=f(3)SyntaxError: invalid syntax>>> I tried in a lot of ways as you can see and could get it. Spaces (and no spaces) didnt help. What am I doing wrong?, Resolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 8:58 am -04:00,Im wondering: Is 41 points a total number of points for this assignment or it is the number of points just for the first step?, Unresolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 9:32 am -04:00,Hmm thank you but what is the maximum score for the first part then? Sorry for bothering but I dont know whether I have to improve my work or go to the next steps., Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 4th 2013 1:01 pm -04:00,Hi. I understand Angel and Shannon. I spent much more time doing exercises and assignment 1 than I expected. I have done the Assign.1 just before the first deadline in the last hour. I was about to quit and I would have done it if my work wouldnt pass. Lukilly I managed to go through with a pretty good grade. I keep thinking about my mind - is it really suited enough to perform such operations? Some people do in a very few minutes what I was trying to do in several hours. For now I will try. Two weeks have passed. The matter is what is a justifiable amount of time to spend on it. All of us have to answer it for ourselves. The most important for me  is that..I have a fun doing it although Im not a computer bug.,None,1
Wednesday September 11th 2013 12:23 pm -04:00,Im experiencing a problem with this question because when I run the code that was supposed to be right I get only one character as the answer. It should have given me all the characters from one string in another. Im confused because I got this answer counted as a right one(so I got  one point) but I see there is some kind of a problem and I dont know where. Are you sure one of the given codes works properly?, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:31 pm -04:00,When I try the third given example it should return three characters but it returns only one. It means that function results in the first common character instead of all. Where is the problem? May be some TA will be able to check it out? Im working on it for couple of hours so I tried it several times. There has to be a mistake in the given function body or somewhere is my mistake. Well when I rewrite the function from the question and then the function body from one of the answers that ment to be right and it works but not properly? I dont know. , Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 6:10 am -04:00,Lets then consider a function and my question is: why it doesnt return all common characters but one?>>> def give_me_all_common_letters(w1 w2):     ((str str) -> str            Return all letters of str word2(w2) that are present in str             word1 (w1)             >>> give_me_all_common_letters(halloween hello)             helo             >>> give_me_all_common_letters(make cake)             ake            res =     for ch in w1:        if ch in w2:            res = res + ch            return res        >>> give_me_all_common_letters(halloween hello)h>>> give_me_all_common_letters(make cake)a>>> , Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 7:19 am -04:00,Gee I wouldnt think that allignment matters so much. Now its working! Thanks a lot!, Resolved,1
Tuesday September 17th 2013 5:22 am -04:00,Thank you it helped., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 6:34 am -04:00,Hi I also have a problem because my f. body doesnt work. Maybe you try to look at it:for ch in nuc:                if nuc == A:            return T        elif nuc == T:            return A        elif nuc == C:            return G        elif nuc == G:            return C        >>> get_complement(AGGTA)>>> , Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 10:43 am -04:00,Yes I tried to do it without for statement. It doesnt work either. Well I think it might be a problem of indentation which I dont really understand. I just try space by space when I have an indent problem. At some point it works but how? Anyway thank you very much for your time. I will try again.., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 7:11 am -04:00,It shouldnt return the complement in semicolons though. Instead of T should be T. May be a for statement would help.., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 2:48 am -04:00,Ok youre right. Sorry for misleading..., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 3:26 pm -04:00,Maybe try to get into the assignment and then there are two buttons - one submit and another one is Feedback  view - get into this one (view). There you will have the table with report - get into the detail. Youll have a specific information about success or failure. If there is a failure it will be written what is the problem and what stage your function doesnt pass on., Unresolved,0
