Thursday September 5th 2013 5:44 pm -04:00,The problem summary: I believe I have completed assignment 1 attempting all steps from 1 through 7. I have also tested the body of the function Ive written for each situation and saved it. However my overall score still shows 28/41. I am not sure if I missed something out or if I havent answered the questions properly. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have also posted a screenshot of the body functions Ive written for each step. Thank you very much for your time.[~ep]\color{red}{ext{[~ep]}}[Edit: please do not post working code snippets.
