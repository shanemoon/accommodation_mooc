Sunday September 29th 2013 2:31 pm -04:00,dear Jennifer and PaulI just learned of your course yesterdayand have been trying to catch up.I took the Interactive Programming in Python course from Rice U on Coursera and liked it very much and have been looking for a follow-on course but had not found yours.I am very impressed by the quality of the materials and exercises. I took all the tests but as most of them are already behind the hard deadline my grades do not seem to count. I am also doing the assignments and finding it very well prepared !I am not taking this course for the certificate but it would be nice if I could get it. Is there any chance I might still make it?Please adviseThank you!, Unresolved,0

Sunday September 29th 2013 4:47 pm -04:00,We had a problem like this on another Coursera course (on Heterogeneous Paralell programming).The grader allocates some space to keep the log files for each student but after a while it gets full then the grader behaves strangely.I believe this is happening now as I submit exactly the same code as I did before and instead of getting 25/37 I get 11/37. Also functions that had already passed are now failing in the grader.Can you please verify this with Micha Livne that wrote the grader?, Unresolved,11
