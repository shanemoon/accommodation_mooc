Friday August 30th 2013 6:35 am -04:00,In IDLE go to File>New Window.  Type your code in the text file that opens and save it with a  .py  extension.  Then go to Run>Run Module or press F5.  Every time you change your code make sure you save before you run the module.  Your code will stay in the text file and you can change it or add to it as you need to., Resolved,1

Monday September 2nd 2013 8:28 pm -04:00,In this case there shouldnt be much difference in the likelihood of making an error if you rewrite the code yourself because its short(and its exactly the same as the code in  to_24_hour_clock) .  All it does is return   seconds % 24.  However in longer sections of code you are more likely to make a mistake (such as misspelled words missing words letters or symbols etc.) if you write the code over and over again.  Its just better to write good code one time and then refer to It whenever you need it.Your code may be perfect each time you time you rewrite it so there is no guarantee that you will make more mistakes if you rewrite code repeatedly but why do all that extra work when you dont have to?  And for numbers that are less than 0 you should still get the correct answer (I think but Im not sure) but the answer will be different than for positive numbers., Resolved,2
Monday September 2nd 2013 8:43 pm -04:00,I wouldnt worry too much about time zones that are not on the hour.  Just focus on writing code for time zones that are on the hour.  If your code is written correctly it should work for all time zones whether they are on the hour or not., Resolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:22 pm -04:00,Take out the commas in the return statement.  See if that works., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:30 pm -04:00,I dont think they are necessary.  The function takes three arguments but it should only return 1 result.  I have the exact same return statement without the commas and I get the correct answers.  With the commas I dont get an error but I get three different answers(none of them are correct)., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:36 pm -04:00,I didnt even notice that the function was calling itself in the return statement.  Maybe I should start drinking coffee., Unresolved,1
Monday September 2nd 2013 9:51 pm -04:00,I had the same problem.  The file just opened in my browser.  I highlighted and copied all the text.  Then I pasted it in a new Notepad document and saved it as  a1.py.  Try fixing the problem that way., Unresolved,2
Monday September 2nd 2013 10:13 pm -04:00,Maybe its an issue with the operating system we use.  I use Windows 8 and when I click or right-click on the link there is no option for saving or downloading the file.  It just opens in the browser.Were you at least able to copy the text and create the file yourself?  And did it work?, Unresolved,0
