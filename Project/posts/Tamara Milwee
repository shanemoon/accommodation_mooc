Saturday September 7th 2013 12:24 pm -04:00,I am having this same problem.  How did you fix it?  I did not touch this portion of the code and it was working fine earlier. I dont know why it is suddenly causing a problem. Thanks, Resolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 4:28 pm -04:00,OK this was misleading.  I had a small error in my code but instead of saying the problem was with my code Python told me the error was in the return statement for the time_from_utc code which I never touched. When I fixed my error this other error which was not really an error went away. , Resolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 8:09 pm -04:00,Thanks Tom. My error was a missing quotation mark or 3 of them to be exact.  The confusing part was that Python pointed to the wrong error which really threw me.  Go figure. , Resolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 11:26 am -04:00,The quiz showed this function definition: def last_vowel(s):    i = len (s)-1    while i >= 0:        if s[i] in aeiouAEIOU:            return s[i]        i = i - 1    return NoneI dont understand why the loop stops after finding the last vowel because i is still >=0 it seems like the loop should keep executing until i is not >=0.  Can someone explain this?  Thanks  Tamara, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 7:16 pm -04:00,Thanks but I still dont get why it does not keep looping until i < 0., Unresolved,0
