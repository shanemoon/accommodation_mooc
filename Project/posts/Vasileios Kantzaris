Thursday August 29th 2013 6:06 pm -04:00,Katerina work on the A1.py you have downloaded complete every function save the file. Then run the file (press F5). You can check if your code is ok simply by copying the examples and pasting them to IDLE. When you hit enter if the code is ok it probably returns the same result as in the example. I hope I have been helpful.How come you dont post your questions on the Greek study group also? I think it will be easier for us to help. , Unresolved,1

Monday September 2nd 2013 1:36 am -04:00,YOU ARE NOT. You should keep in mind that although some courses claim to be designed for the absolute beginner they are not. A little programming background is required. But if you dont have even little experience in programming you can make it up by studying. I struggled a lot in order to understand the logic and philosophy of how to make a simple program and I dont consider myself to be even close to a programmer. So I suggest you use some of the free online resources in order to study about Python  and you will make it. For the 1st assignment try to understand the use of operators (+ - / // % * ) and use the examples to calculate the relations between the variables given. It helped me use paper and pencil in order to write the problems and then solve them.But you are not stupid. , Resolved,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 5:44 pm -04:00,I wrote in Question 9: s1.find(s2 (s1.find(s2) + s1.find(s2))) and it was considered wrong although I tested it and it run ok in IDLE. I know it mentions to call str.find twice but this is a hint if something else works why shouldt it be considered right?, Unresolved,-2
Wednesday September 11th 2013 2:27 am -04:00,Yes you are right my mistake I had checked it with a few examples (like the ones in the exercise I had never thought to use any other).MANY THANKS FOR YOUR HELP. , Unresolved,0

Saturday September 14th 2013 3:39 am -04:00,Glenna there is a hint saying that you have to use str.find() twice in your code. If you use it once it will give the first occurence of what you are lookin for. s1 = rock and roll#     0123456789012s2 = o>>>s1.find(s2)1  # if you use this function>>>s1.find(s2 2)  # you can use 2 or more but definetely less than the index place of o10  # this is is what you are looking forSo now try to think s1.find(s2) = 1.  If you use the function like this:s1.find(s2 s1.find(s2))  the result will be 1 since it would be the same with calling the function: s1.find(s2 1).So you have to look further...It is not difficult try think a little and you will figure it out, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 6:05 pm -04:00,I have exactly the same problem I have been struggling for 2 hours not being able to solve it. I have checked the make_str_from_column(board column_index) function and it is definetely working (I even checked it with a board consisting of 4 sublists). I cannot figure out what is going on...., Resolved,1
Tuesday September 24th 2013 7:03 pm -04:00,THANK YOU SOOOOOOOOO MUCH. I just figured it out feeling really dumb not to have seen that len(board) returns the number of rows not columns. thumbs up for the forum a great help., Resolved,1

Wednesday September 25th 2013 4:25 pm -04:00,I am failing this test. The message I get after the submition is: FAILURE: AssertionErrorTrue is not false : Score not updated.I am adding player_info[1] to the function that counts the score obtained when a correct word is found (I checked it having it return the result in the example and I get 7 which is correct) but I cannot understand what I am doing wrong. Any hint please???, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 4:48 pm -04:00,Thats what I meant I did. (player_info[1] + word_score(word)).Anyway I think I have found my mistake...Waiting for an hour to resubmit....Thanks, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 5:00 pm -04:00,I forgot the player_info[0] part meaning that the update I produced was only the sum of the score not the player name..., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 6:46 pm -04:00,Still failed although I think that my line of code is ok. So lets resume.Since its a Nonetype and nothing is returned we dont have to use return or print right? Applying update_score in ([Jonathan 4] ANT) should produce [Jonathan 7] since when word_score is appled in ANT it produces 3 and this is added to 4 (4+3=7)  right?My word_score function is OK (well tested and graded after submition)So where is my mistake? , Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 7:39 pm -04:00,finally I got it right it was right in front of my eyes sometimes I feel sooooo dump not being able to solve simple problems. Many thanks. 30/37 and going....Probably you will hear from me a lot in the remaining functions..., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 7:45 pm -04:00,I have tried using your code (with rstrip in append) and I get the following error message when I run it in IDLE:line = words_file.readline()AttributeError: str object has no attribute readlineAny idea what it means?, Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 3:41 am -04:00,I am still struggling with this function. I used the code provided above but still getting error. I will try to make a list of what I have done trying not to violate the honor code:Created an empty list (as an accumulator)Assigned a parameter named line for every line in the file that has to be read using readline and rstrip (in order to remove .used a while loop for every line not equal to Updated list usind append line and rstrip (indented in block with while loop)Updated line using readline and rstripAsked for the value of list via returnI keep getting the following error message:line = words_file.readline().rstrip()AttributeError: str object has no attribute readlineAny hint? I tried modifying it but it led to nothing., Resolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 7:56 am -04:00,Finally I found out that everything was ok. I had a problem testing the function because wordlist1.txt and A3.py were saved in different directories. Silly amateur mistake...., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 4:37 pm -04:00,I know that (I used return just to check it). However I think I have found out my mistake. I will wait for an hour to resubmit.Thanks a lot., Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 7:08 pm -04:00,I struggled a lot but finally it is very easy. Think of what we have seen in the examples. When we update we do this:total = 0total = total + 1 In our case we want to update the score in player_info. I guess you have already created the word_score function. So this function has to be added to the player_info in the appropriate place.Its a Nonetype dont use return or print just one line code., Resolved,1
