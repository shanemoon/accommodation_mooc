Saturday August 24th 2013 11:59 pm -04:00,Answer for both 7 and 8 should be [~ep]\color{red}{ext{[~ep]}}. Did you write [~ep]\color{red}{ext{[~ep]}} for Q.No 7?[Edit: please do not post graded quiz questions or their answers. ~ep]\color{red}{ext{[Edit: please do not post graded quiz questions or their answers. ~ep]}},None,-2
Thursday August 29th 2013 3:57 pm -04:00,I also submitted the answer after the step 2 as advised. And I found this has been considered as an attempt though it may not matter. I dont understand the logic in this ie submitting after step 2 and after completing the full assignment., Resolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 12:26 pm -04:00,You dont have to write 5 examples. Give 2 or 3 examples that will cover all probabilities to test run better. The parameter is in seconds (as per the handout). Assume 2 or 3 numbers (make sure that atleast one number is more than 60 and one more than 3600). try to find the seconds after eliminating the hour and minutes using simple operators. get the seconds (it will be less than 60). and use this as an example. Then use the receipe for designing function. Hope it is clear., Resolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 11:50 am -04:00,No need to use print statement. (It is clearly said not to use print statement in the instruction). Just write get_minutes(62).It will give the result 1 if the program is correct. Hope it is clear., Resolved,2
Friday August 30th 2013 12:34 pm -04:00,It is clearly stated that the parameter is in seconds. Hence the coding should be as per the assignment. As you have input in hours probably while grading it may be showing failure. , Unresolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 2:39 pm -04:00,It is a case of failure posted by Bharanidharan. I just posted my comments. Failure has been posted by the concerned person.I just posted my comments on Bharanidharans note. I have already submitted my assignment and graded 41/41. Thank you Sandeep., Unresolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 2:58 am -04:00,You have to mention     get_complement(char) instead of get_complement(dna) as it is the char which is to be complemented. Correct it you will get the answer., Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 1:31 pm -04:00,x_seq = () for -----------------------  --------------------        x_seq = x_seq + get_com(cha)return ----------This will give you the answer. , Resolved,5
