But the grader mark this result as wrong.Note: I indicated the result as a number not as a string, Unresolved,0

Inside the loop check if the variable of each iteration is not a valid nucleotid and if is not add 1 to the counter.Only if at the end the counter keeps in zero return true as a valid sequence., Resolved,0
