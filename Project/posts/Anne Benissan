Thursday August 29th 2013 5:59 pm -04:00,hello I seem to be missing out some things. Where does this assignment 1 download come from? I have completed homework for assignment 1 and I did not know where to do the exercises recommended and not graded. Is the file you are referring to based on these optional exercises?Sorry but I am confused and I dont even how to start a new thread to ask basic questions such as this one., Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 6:12 pm -04:00,Thank you Etienne for your explanation. Please confirm that when it is said that this assignment should be done when the week 2 videos and exercise are done by exercise they mean the homework correct?Also I remember that there was the optional possibility to do the exercise of chapter 3 and 4 when I started the homework for week1. Where are these chapters ? Thanks againAnne, Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 6:38 pm -04:00,Thank you Etienne. i did buy the text book and it is really worth buying it but it did not seem to refer to the textbook. I bought the e- version and it does not have chapter per se. The textbook has exercises after each section but the fact that they use chapter makes me wonder if they dont talk about something else.It would be interesting to know where to find these chapters. If anyone knows please chime in., Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 6:59 pm -04:00,You are right it corresponds to the textbook. Thank you for your help, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 3:05 pm -04:00,As much as I read and try to understand Fernandos message I still feel the question is beyond me. I dont understand anything even when I break it down. I dont understand the logic of the if statement in this for loop. I am completely lost.Here is my train of thoughts when I look at the Shell view above:for loop has a condition withinchar.isdigit () return a bool statement and not return the opposite bool statement so if char.isdigit() returns true not added will result false. In our case how does that help?What follows after makes no sense for me at all.Please let me  know what I should do to find my way through this.Thanks , Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 5:42 pm -04:00,Hello FernandoThank you so much for the time you spent writing this I will study it in details to see if that confirms what i have finally understood after reviewing for hours.I will let you know.But thank you so much. Your help is really appreciated.Anne, Resolved,1
Thursday September 12th 2013 5:48 pm -04:00,i understand it all. Not sure though I would be able to find that on my own but I guess this is not asked at least for now.Thanks again Fernando!, Resolved,2
Thursday September 12th 2013 12:23 pm -04:00,Hello I am sorry I dont get it either. I understand the logic but how is this a debugger? How do you find a bug with this?, Resolved,10
Thursday September 12th 2013 2:22 pm -04:00,HiI dont understand why I get different results.on python shell I get 9 which makes no sense to me.on python visualizer I get 0 which makes complete sense.Can you please help me understand why I get different results?Thanks, Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 2:42 pm -04:00,You are right I did not run it until print result and now I get 9.Looking at the visualizer I think I understand now the for loop better.Thank you for your help Anonymous!, Resolved,1
Saturday September 14th 2013 3:48 pm -04:00,Hello EtiennePlease explain one thing. I totally understand the reasoning you suggest but a for loop in my understanding will check each character of a string so why does it stop after the first character?I have the same problem: when the function is executed it stops at the first character when this character meets the condition. I dont know how to use an accumulator that will return a bool. So what am I missing?Thanks , Unresolved,3
Saturday September 14th 2013 5:01 pm -04:00,I have been thinking for hours on this and I am still stuck. I am very very frustrated. No matter how I organize this I can see that only the function is executed for the first character only.here is my defdef is_valid_sequence(potential_dna):     (str) -> bool    Return True if and only if the DNA sequence is valid that is it    contains no characters other than A T C G. A string with    lowercase letters is not a valid DNA sequence.    >>> is_valid_sequence(ACTRB)    False    >>> is_valid_sequence(ATCGGC)    True    >>> is_valid_sequence(ATCggc)    False    >>> is_valid_sequence(123abc)    False        s = 0    if potential_dna.isalpha() and potential_dna.isupper():                for char in potential_dna:            if char not in ATCG:                s = s + 1                if s >= 1:                    return  False                else:                    return True                                                else:        return FalsePlease help me because I am close to give up. I find this week 4 far more difficult and the time I overall spent on the exercise combined to this assignment is simply insane and I work full time have three kids etc...I think I know the week 4 video lectures by heart by now... and I am still stuck. Why is this damn accumulator not working! I have tried with str as well and same problem.If anyone can enlighten me I would really appreciate , Unresolved,1
Saturday September 14th 2013 5:21 pm -04:00,Anna how do you check a valid sequence with the visualizer? I checked it with the debugger and unfortunately it did not clarify what I am doing wrong., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 5:16 pm -04:00,I so agree with you Anonymous but  I have tried the For char in potential_dna: if char not in ATGC return False  but it only checked the first character. This is why I tried to add a str as an accumulator to make sure each character was checked one after the other.Why doesnt it work? Inititally for me a for loop by definition checks each iteration one after the other. I dont understand why for me it stops at the first character within the argument.Can you help me understand that?Thank you so much for your help, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 5:29 pm -04:00,Is my problem an indentation one? Anonymous I have tried not less than 28 different ways of doing this including the one you describe. Each time though I can see that it does not move on to the next character when I run this tricky example ACTRB it returns true!, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 5:53 pm -04:00,I think I am giving up on this one as nothing makes sense to me anymore. Annas advice to check the visualizer puzzled me even more: char refers to  A and the function executes and returns True.I leave you with your  string conversation. Thank you both Anna and Anonymous anyway, Unresolved,1
Saturday September 14th 2013 5:58 pm -04:00,Hello Christine thank you for your message you are talking about a boolean variable valid  to be created .To be honest I could not care less about the empty string at this stage :-)Thanks for your input I am going to try that., Unresolved,1
Saturday September 14th 2013 6:18 pm -04:00,Hello JoseThank you Jose you are reminding me that b is not B in python. I also understand why I should remove .isalpha. Let me try your approach that indeed seems much simpler than what I came up with.I will keep you posted, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 7:34 pm -04:00,Thank you all for your help! After a break I finally solved that problem and Jose you were right it was much simpler than I had started it .The empty string as True is still a mystery though! but I will leave it as-isThanks again, Unresolved,1

Wednesday September 18th 2013 5:05 pm -04:00,It might be just me but I feel that things accelerated last week as we combine more and more concepts.As many I believe I was totally new to programming when I started this course. Although I did submit successfully both exercise and assignment so far I dont feel I am mastering anything and I mostly succeed after many trials and errors.I wish there were more exercises given in order for us to check as we learn what we truly understand. I might get away with this weeks exercise the same way I finally finished last weeks assignment and exercise but I have a feeling that I will be stuck next week because I dont feel I deeply understand what I am doing.I should add that I dont have two days per week to dedicate to the course either. And last week I spent far more than the 6-8 hours claimed of work load.I am really motivated to finish the course. But at this stage I am not sure this is going to happen considering how little I understand it all. To tell you frankly when I opened this weeks exercise I felt blank as If I had not listened carefully to all the videos.Am I doing something wrong? Would anyone else like more micro exercises beyond the quizzes?, Unresolved,7
Wednesday September 18th 2013 5:44 pm -04:00,Thank you Tolunay for your reply. But the fact that I spent so much time and would probably have to spend as much time if I had to redo the exercise or the assignment one week later shows that I dont build my knowledge.At this stage I am unable to create examples of applications on my own beyond what is offered. For instance question 5 in the exercise this week is very complicated for me because I simply did not digest the concepts while for range well enough. I know I will get there at some stage but I also know that at the end of the many hours I will spend finding a solution I wont have that feeling that I am understanding things better.I plan to read the full chapter 9 of pragmatic programming and hope it will fall into place in my head.I just think there is something wrong in the rhythm of this class since last week and I wish we had more opportunities to try exercises specific with each function before we have to combine them all and arbitrate which one we should choose. We all know that in Python the devil is in the details: one indent wrong or a punctuation issue and the code wont work.I am way beyond the work load time so I am wondering if I am the only one feeling  that I am struggling for no true result in the end.If I am the only one with that feeling then maybe programming is not for me., Unresolved,5
Wednesday September 18th 2013 6:07 pm -04:00,Thanks Anonymous! I will print the summary lectures and see how that goes for me. I agree with your rating scale of understanding and I barely reach level 2 I think . I am sure that will not be enough for next week and the last week.I like your strategy and it seems to be working well for you. So I will try.I still believe that more exercises for each lecture would not hurt..., Unresolved,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 12:04 pm -04:00,Dear All Thank you for your beneficial contributions that helped me go through that week. I finished the exercise week 5 yet with the same feeling that I dont master much.Exercise 5 for me felt like a lesson in itself and I would love it if each question was detailed because it seems that some questions covered applications we had not covered at all.For instance in question 5 I struggled with defining the list. We had only seen list of 5 elements that could easily been displayed. If it were not for the enlightening message from Tolunay in the range discussion I would still be stuck with the while loop. Again the a = [1][0] was also a mystery for me. had we seen that before?I have been working with programmers for my own site in php for more than three years and they all fail to explain things FULLY this is why I am here. I want to do it right so start with python. I have the same feeling here.I dont think at this stage we are able to do creative thinking and second guessing when we do the exercises. This exercise deserved much more explanation than what we had from the lectures.Good luck to you all for week 6.And thank you again., Unresolved,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 2:55 pm -04:00,Thank you Paul. Then I need an update on what return means. We have seen other functions that return list: the fact the initial list is modified makes it a new list doesnt it?Sorry I still dont get it., Unresolved,0

Tuesday September 24th 2013 11:42 am -04:00,Thanks Ashwini I think I got the difference with your suggestion.Here is what I understand shift_left returns nonetype because the list does not change: only the order of the list changes.Paul did I understand correctly?Thank you both for your help, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 2:20 pm -04:00,After reading it over and over I am confused with this:   Return a board read from open file board_file. The board file will contain    one row of the board per line. Newlines are not included in the board.    the second board mentioned corresponds to the board that should be returned by the function.in the last sentence that means that we should not include newlines in the board returned.Please confirm that I got this right., Resolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 1:32 pm -04:00,I know that but I am still struggling.I think what confuses me is that board_file is a list of rows with one row per line. Then my understanding is that you create a list from strings using index.But here I dont see how I would use indexes....

Wednesday October 2nd 2013 6:57 pm -04:00,I am desperately trying to get the last function read_board right.As the python is obstinately giving me a syntax error even if I copied paste the same exact lines before with a result I am submitting each new attempt in order to get some feedback I can use.Note that all the other functions on my assignment are correct.I usually get 4 errors. Always the same ..on python shell I get:SyntaxError: multiple statements found while compiling a single statementEach time I am more confused. and I cant tell you how many hours I have worked on this function to try to make it right.Since assignments are supposed to be teaching tools I would really appreciate if somebody helped me to get unstuck with this blockage.I sailed through exercise 7 without any problems: I guess the tuple was a relief considering my difficulty with this function supposed to return a list of list of strings.I have read and re-read each post on the subject and making a list of list out of a list of 4 items is not an issue.

Thanks in particular to Tom Tolunay and Etienne as well as Anonymous who never failed to help when needed.Thank you Paul and Jen for putting online such a quality course. I knew close to nothing about programming and I feel I learned a lot about the logic behind a program in particular .I did this course because I have a website soon to be launched partially coded in php with bits of js this site is itself hooked to a wordpress site. I want to be able to understand my code and eventually modify it. The design is in CSS and I dont even know which version.What next course would you recommend for me to do in order to understand even further?I would love for instance to learn the reason behind choosing a language versus another one.My goal is to be able to check the quality of the code and have some criteria to select a programmer to help me run this site on the tech side.Any information you could provide me will be deeply appreciated.Warm regards to you allAnne, Unresolved,0
