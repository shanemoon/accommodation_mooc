Friday August 30th 2013 11:46 am -04:00,Another modulus question: how come 1 % 24 = 1 but -1 % 24 = 23? Shouldnt the remainder be -1?Similarly I dont get why -1 // 24 = -1 when 1 // 24 = 0?, Resolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 11:40 am -04:00,You spelled fahrenheit wrong when writing the def statement (You spelled it with an e). , Unresolved,2
Friday August 30th 2013 9:30 pm -04:00,Also be careful - in your header you have named the function conver_to_celsius (missing the t in convert). Thats why when you call it in the shell you get NameError: convert_to_celsius is not defined., Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 12:58 am -04:00,To close the triple-quoted string you used commas () - you need to use quote marks same as what you opened the string with (). I think python thinks the string is still open (ie you havent closed it) and in fact your return statement (return fahrenheit - 32 * 5 / 9) is being interpreted as part of a still open string!Replace the  with  and everything should be okay.Also you havent closed the brackets in the type contract but as this is part of the string it doesnt affect the running of the function., Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 1:19 am -04:00,Hey NickThe design recipe is a set of instructions to build a complete function not just whats between the header and code body (ie. header and code body are a part of the total design recipe):ExamplesWhat should your function do?Type a couple of example calls.Pick a name (often a verb or verb phrase): What is a short answer to What does your function do?Type ContractWhat are the parameter types?What type of value is returned?HeaderPick meaningful parameter names.DescriptionMention every parameter in your description.Describe the return value.BodyWrite the body of your function.TestRun the examples.Tim, Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 1:12 am -04:00,When time // 3600 is being evaluated youre getting the hours part but what you need is the remainder to get the minutes and seconds (maybe try time % 3600 - this will then spit out a number which you would then perform an operation on to get minutes). Similarly for the remaining seconds...I hope this makes some sense!, Unresolved,2
Wednesday September 4th 2013 6:00 am -04:00,Yeah I dont get this either - I thought its just a matter of running the code in the visualiser getting to step 4 out of 11 and then counting all the stack frames? Im doing that but getting marked wrong. Am I missing something here?, Unresolved,0
