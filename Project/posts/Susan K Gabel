Wednesday September 25th 2013 2:10 am -04:00,I am getting a score of 32/37 with errors in read_words and read_board and yet my game is working correctly.  Here is output from my test of these two functions in the python shell.  I simply open the file execute my function and see what it returns.  The board and the word list that are returned look correct to me.  Am I missing something in the requirements?>>> board_file = open(board1.txt r)>>> read_board(board_file)[[E F J A J C O W S S] [S D G K S R F D F F] [A S R J D U S K L K] [H E A N D N D J W A] [A N S D N C N E O P] [P M S N F H H E J E] [J E P Q L Y N X D L]]>>> words_file = open(wordlist1.txt r)>>> read_words(words_file)[CRUNCHY COWS EAT GRASS], Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 2:28 am -04:00,The read_board messages are:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Note that the last line of the input file for a board does not have a newline character.FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Non-square board not loaded correctly.FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Board not loaded correctly. Did you get rows and columns mixed up?The read_words messages are:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : What happens to the last line of a file that has no new-line character?FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Wrong value returned on a one-line file., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 3:03 am -04:00,The conclusion Im coming to is this:  If there is not a Precondition given about the format of the input data we cant make assumptions and must construct additional test cases.  I was so happy when I got the game working on the given board and word list I thought I was done and that all tests would pass in the grader.  Its clear now that there are additional test cases for data formats that my code does not handle correctly.  I should have realized this right away that we would be expected to make up other test cases (without being told to)., Resolved,2
