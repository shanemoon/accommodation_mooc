Wednesday August 28th 2013 1:36 am -04:00,this is true for python but not for all languages.For example in php double quotes allow commands and variables to be run or accessed while embedded inside a string.# the dollar sign represents a variable prefix. $value = 5;$double_quotes = This value is equal to $value;$single_quotes = This value is equal to $value;# echo is a rough equivalent to print.echo $double_quote;   # This value is equal to 5        // A processed string was returnedecho $single_quote;   # This value is equal to $value   // A literal string was returnedJust food for thought not nagging on anyone ;3, Resolved,3
Sunday September 8th 2013 4:14 pm -04:00,What question are you guys talking about question 13?-> grade1 and grade2 represent two grades (floats) between 0.0 and 100.0 inclusive. A passing grade is greater than or equal to 50.   Select the code fragment(s) that prints the average of all passing grade(s). The printed value should be 0.0 if neither grade is a passing grade the passing grade if exactly one grade is a passing grade and the average of the two grades if both are passing grades.Watch your ifs and elifs!, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 3:58 pm -04:00,Look at the feedback given from assignment 1.  Your equations/solutions to the problems may not be working for all test cases. Try and figure out why<3Also You need to score 70% or higher on the coursework in order to earn a certificate.  I assume that means when you add everything together you need to have a score of 70%.  Be aware some assignments are weighted more heavily than others such as assignment 1., Resolved,1
Sunday September 8th 2013 4:39 pm -04:00,Its 10% of the final grade so if you completely fail assignment 1 the MAX you can receive at the end of the course is 90%.  So you will probably be fine just dont let it become a pattern.  However you should try to understand why you are receiving full points because this stuff is CORE to programming and if you dont understand it you will get lost programming builds upon itself., Resolved,3

Sunday September 8th 2013 4:29 pm -04:00,aka the reason it is giving you that error is because your unfinished string yesterdayis being submitted when you press shift enter.  Are you doing your work completely in command-line?, Unresolved,0
