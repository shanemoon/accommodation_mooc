Monday August 19th 2013 12:05 am -04:00,The problem summary: I downloaded the Installer for Windows 7 (Windows x86 MSI Installer (3.3.2) (sig)) and tried running IDLE  for the first time and got an error saying IDLEs subprocess didnt make connection. Either IDLE cant start a subprocess or personal firewall software is blocking a connection, Resolved,3
Monday August 19th 2013 12:21 am -04:00,Win7 = 32 bitTried disabling firewall - same resultI am currently using python.exe command line to use the prompt but it would be better if I was working in IDLE.Please help, Resolved,1
Monday August 19th 2013 9:52 am -04:00,I dont know what changed between last night and now but IDLE works okay now. I think its most likely because I was running it on my work computer on a public network. Besides I did not configure this machine - someone else did. Thanks so much for all your help!, Resolved,1
