Monday September 16th 2013 4:59 am -04:00,I dont get the problem. I like having the last days before the deadline to be the weekend. You have one week really two weeks to finish the assignments (as the hard deadline is one week after the recommended deadline). If you cant finish it in two weeks the fault probably lies with your time management skills not the timing of the deadlines., Unresolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 4:30 am -04:00,is instead of == was also the cause of my late night yesterday where I kept trying to change my get_complementary_sequence code to pass (mentioned the assertionerror as well). My get_complement code had already passed using is instead of ==. Because it already passed I didnt think to change it at first. However when reusing the get_complement function in the get_complementary_sequence code it failed autograde (even though the results in the shell were correct). Lesson of the day..... is is not ==! If it werent for the forums I would never have found out most likely. :), Resolved,2
