Tuesday August 20th 2013 5:19 pm -04:00,Python is also a basic building block for programming concepts. Its easy to understand concept. It is a  much lighter and more flexible tool for web projects. It has a very less run time than other languages. Python has a relative small quantity of lines of code which makes it less prone to issues easier to debug and more maintainable. Python can scale to solve complex problems as illustrated by the fact that it powers most of YouTube and DropBox. It is fast. Even Google has made Python one of its official programming languages. We dont have to look up references frequently nor are we overwhelmed by the formalities of the language like we would in Java or C++.Pythons simple and straight-forward syntax also encourages good programming habits especially through its focus on white space indentation which contributes to the development of neat looking code.Finally while PHP is notorious for the inconsistency in its naming methods Pythons naming convention is prevalent from module to module so developers are less likely to make syntax errors. This means fewer bugs and faster development.Hope this helps!! :) :) :) :),None,35
