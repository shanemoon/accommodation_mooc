Sunday September 15th 2013 11:59 pm -04:00,Im getting similar problem but Im getting 20/24. In an earlier post someone said that the issue can be resolved by correcting typo in the function name but that doesnt seem like the case here. Ive also tested all the functions that have failed in my feedback and they are working fine in my shell. I really have no idea whats going on...Here are the messages I got and the results from my test:Method Description:Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorNone != TA : Have you tested your function on the example in the handout?>>> get_complementary_sequence(AT)TAMethod Description:Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences        of each nucleotide?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorNone != TAGCTAGC : Have you tested your function on a sequence with multiple occurrences            of each nucleotide?>>> get_complementary_sequence(ATCGATCG)TAGCTAGCMethod Description:Have you tested your function with all 4 nucleotides?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorNone != T : Have you tested your function with all 4 nucleotides?>>> get_complement(A)TMethod Description:Have you tested your function with a valid DNA sequeunce that uses        all the nucleotides?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Have you tested your function with a valid DNA sequeunce that uses            all the nucleotides?>>> is_valid_sequence(GCTTA)True, Resolved,0

Monday September 16th 2013 12:14 am -04:00,Im not using print or True/False.I also tried empty string and my script tells me that its valid and returns empty strings for the complementary.>>> is_valid_sequence()True>>> get_complementary_sequence()>>> get_complement()>>> , Resolved,0

Monday September 16th 2013 12:39 am -04:00,Youre right! I got 24/24 after swapping out all the is in my functions.I read the sign out loud in my mind as is and typed it out instead of using the equals to sign...Thanks a lot!!, Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 12:48 am -04:00,Yup! but now I know they are not the same and hopefully wont make the same mistake again :), Resolved,0
