Saturday September 21st 2013 7:47 pm -04:00,Is it possible that there is an issue with the auto-testing for get_compelent(nuc)? There are only 4 cases when I test them I get all the right complementary nucleotides Additionally my code for get_complementary_sequence (which calls get_compelent(nuc)) tests out fine both in the class auto-testing and when I test it suggesting that there is an issue.Can you comment on this possibility?, Unresolved,0
