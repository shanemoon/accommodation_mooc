Tuesday September 10th 2013 11:14 am -04:00,I used a dictionary it worked.complement={A:TT:AC:GG:C}Then I looked at the video for loop over str ( the one where they counted the vowels).for char in s:     var = var + call your dictionaryreturn vardont forget to set your variable to empty     (just like in the video)., Resolved,2
Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:05 pm -04:00,Has anyone got get_complementary_sequence correct yet.I can get AT = TA and GCTAGCT = TAGCTAGC but i cant get both at the same time.There only example shows AT should return TA.  Which looks to be the reverse of the parameter or the complement of the DNA.  They do not give any other examples and I get 1 failure.  the info I get back from the failure messages states I should get GCTAGCTA = TAGCTAGC.  This looks to be the DNA strand in reverse and then the complement of that.  But that doesnt work with AT., Resolved,-1
Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:20 pm -04:00,Thanks.  That worked.My code for get_complement was the same for get_complementary_sequence.  I guess they were looking for the same outcome., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:17 pm -04:00,Remember the video where you spliced and catenate.you would want to splice dna1[?:?] by num and then + (insert) dna2 and then + the end splice of dna1[?:?].you would want to make that equal to some variable and then return the variable., Resolved,2
