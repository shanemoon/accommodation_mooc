Sunday August 18th 2013 9:32 pm -04:00,Nice to meet all of you.  Im from Austin Texas and I want to learn more about Python so I can apply it to my job.  Of course I plan to earn the certificate too.  Hopefully all of you will enjoy this course and learn a lot from this course too.  Take care.,None,12
Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:06 am -04:00,I made sure I selected render all objects on the heap and it wont move forward when I clicked on forward button.  why did I do wrong ??  why I couldnt move forward when I clicked on the button Forward ??  , Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 3:00 pm -04:00,Pat do you mean we can leave the to_24_hour_clock alone and not to call it or we need to call to_24_hour_clock function ??   im still trying to figure this out ...  thanks., Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 3:10 pm -04:00,ok we need to call ...  let me think how i need to call this function ...  thanks michael !!, Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 3:47 pm -04:00,Chrissie let me give you some hints.  you just need to play around the to_24_hour_clock time utc_offset.  you only need one line for the code ...  but be sure you test all the examples and make sure they come out right.  i almost missed some of them when they are in negative values.  good luck., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 12:45 pm -04:00,I know this course is only available every Monday morning but I wish this course could start 2 days earlier so we all could have another weekend to study and do the assignment.  To be honest I didnt expect to spend over 3.5 hours on week-2 assignment-1.  I thought this is a fundamental Python course and I thought I could finish the assignment in one to 2 hours.  I guess I was under estimate haha ...  So from now on I will start my study and homework as soon as possible just in case I stuck at some where.  However I still want to thank to those of you who tried to help out some people like me by giving some hints who dont have much programming experience and still can get the assignment done eventually.  So for those of you still working on assignment dont give up and you can do it eventually.  Just pay some attention on lectures and some peoples posts and eventually you will get there too.  Good luck to all of you and lets make it to the end of this course !!,None,2

Tuesday September 10th 2013 11:49 pm -04:00,this cant be wrong !!  i got the right answers from IDLE or in python and why i still got it wrong ???  i was using str.find () and the arithmetic operator as well !!  im wondering could the instructor or the web tool has the incorrect answer ??  did anyone get the right answer ???  now im getting 13 out of 14 ..., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 9:59 pm -04:00,question.  i saw the post and i watched the video lecture again and tried it on my codes then i got this error.  i guess we cant have the count inside a function ??  any advice please ??>>> count_nucleotides(ATCGGC G)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#24> line 1 in <module>    count_nucleotides(ATCGGC G)  File C:\Users\Desktop\python\a2.py line 41 in count_nucleotides    return count_nucleotides.count(nucleotide)AttributeError: function object has no attribute count>>> , Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 10:16 pm -04:00,OK now i changed to different name and i got different error. why ??  so the videos example is too simple and the same way will not apply to function.  Kelly any addition help please ??  thanks.>>> count_nucleotides(ATCGGC G)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#31> line 1 in <module>    count_nucleotides(ATCGGC G)  File C:\Users\Desktop\python\a2.py line 40 in count_nucleotides    count_nuclNameError: global name count_nucl is not defined>>>>>> whiteRabbit = hello>>> whiteRabbit.count(l)2>>>, Unresolved,0

Sunday September 15th 2013 10:55 pm -04:00,no kidding !!  without your kind help i wont be able to solve this based on my limited programming knowledge !!  im glad that i finally got 24 out of 24 after about 20 hours of hard work here !!  BIG thank to everyone who is always helping other people as well !!, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 5:14 pm -04:00,ya i have the same counter issue too.  my codes always checked the first character only not going for next characters.  once i know how to fix this counter issue then im set but now im still struggling to figure it out too ..., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 8:05 pm -04:00,i really hope all weekly videos homework and assignments get released by every friday so we have another weekend to study and work with.  to be honest i spent about 4 to 5 hours for assignment 1 but i needed to spend triple amounts of time for assignment 2.  now im not sure how long i need to spend for assignment 3 as the next 2 week lectures are getting harder ...  , Unresolved,5
Wednesday September 25th 2013 10:08 pm -04:00,100% agreed with Shridevi !!  Beginners need more time for study and do assignment.  If I get a 10-year programming co-worker for this assignment probably it only takes him 30 minutes to complete the assignment but it would take me many hours to complete.  So can someone tell the difference now ???  If someone tries to do the assignment an hour before the due date then it is very obvious that the person has time management issue ..., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 3:42 pm -04:00,Thanks to Brian & Toms discussion/post above.  I was stuck on this for few hours and finally I got it worked !!  Tom you did help a lot of people so far very appreciated your help & your time !! , Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 1:41 pm -04:00,ya Juan is right.  it can be easier just by using the for loop then if statement with in then return the boolen !!, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 7:15 pm -04:00,dude I totally agreed with all of you so far.  I thought this would be a Python beginner but actually you really need some programming experiences prior to this course.  If Matti was struggling with his experience that he has I think a lot of people like me even need to struggle more.  I already spent about 15 hours for this assignment-3 yesterday and today and I still only got 33/37.  Hey guess what I have no complaint for this at all and I thought I couldnt make this far before I started this assignment.  I got to rely on this forum a lot to get to this far.  Without this forum there is no way I could move up to this point even I spent about 15 hours on assignment-3.  It is 6:15 pm for me and I guess I really need to take a dinner break.  Good luck to all of you for the final and I believe all of us would pass this course !!, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 4:27 pm -04:00,totally agree with Philip.  I will never ever get this on my own without Tom and Croitorus hints !!  cant believe this one only required one line of code and thats it !!, Unresolved,0
