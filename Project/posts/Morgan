Tuesday August 27th 2013 1:14 am -04:00,Well its written like this originally: 3 + 4 / 2 - 7And youve got to think of what would NORMALLY happen in this situation. Normally if you put it into a calculator as is it would divide the 4 and 2 because division comes first add the 3 and then subtract the 7. You dont want this to happen in this situation. It specifies that it wants to add subtract and then divide. So lets start with just addition that would look like so: (3 + 4) / 2 - 7Thats so far so good but then the sum of 3 and 4 will then divide with 2 because there are no parentheses to specify subtraction. At this point notice that the - 7 is on the right side of the division sign; it should stay there not move to the other side. So (3 + 4) / (2 - 7) makes sense; the parentheses prioritizes addition then subtraction and then division last. , Resolved,5
