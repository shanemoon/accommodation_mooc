Thursday August 29th 2013 1:07 pm -04:00,i wouldnt mind correcting my errors in the homework exercise  but i am a little pressed for time. im afraid that if i press the resubmit button it will clear the whole form and require every single question to be completed again rather than maintain the completion and allow me to edit the corrections only.has anyone been brave enough to go ahead and and hit resubmit and found out exactly what happens when one does this ? yes i am being lazy and hoping to learn from your mistakes - hahaany advice would be most appreciated - john  , Resolved,0

Saturday August 31st 2013 8:50 pm -04:00,anton thank you. a question - how did you submit ? problem by problem or all in one go ? Also there seems to be some debate about submission formats.For example: I downloaded a1.py opened and edited/worked on it idle saved in idle and submitted from that very same file. All the tests (and subsequent re-tests) succeeded in idle yet there were fails in the auto grader. Rather than slash my wrists over it I decided to live with this because the successes outweighed the failures.   Others are saying one needs to save in plain text i.e. notepad etc then submit that file.I havent actually tried this option yet though. What was your experience/advice ?   , Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 9:14 pm -04:00,Thanks I appreciate both responses.Someone on another thread was was talking about saving in notepad before submitting thats why I brought it up.Also I am clear on print and return.Ive gone into more detail here. , Unresolved,0

Saturday August 31st 2013 8:41 pm -04:00,just thought id throw this one into the mix: did the 1st assignment didnt go too badly though the automated grade informs me im failing functions that the tkinter clock calls.however the tkinter clock works absolutely fine - no probs at all.seems like a case of wtf?  # The list of expected functions in a student submission.EXPECTED_FNS = [hours_difference                to_float_hours                get_hours                get_minutes                get_seconds                time_to_utc                time_from_utc], Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 9:05 pm -04:00,yea im not sure if we will be supplied with test cases all the way through the course or if it reaches a point where we must always create our own.if the situation is the former then personally i think that the supplied test cases then should more or less match those that are conducted by the auto grader as this approach would tend to lessen the amount of brain damage in having to revisit problems believed to be solved.maybe there is some logic as to why this is not the case that has been explained elsewhere which i have not read yet ?   , Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 9:19 pm -04:00,michael - thanks. assertion errors however the question remains: why would the tkinter clock still work absolutely perfectly if it was calling (so called) failed functions ? , Unresolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 9:32 pm -04:00,thanks mate. fyi im not about to commit suicide over this however:its possible to check the accuracy of the tkinter clock outputs against sources totally independent of the program itself which i have done.the upshot of it all being that the tkinter clock is working absolutely accurately despite it calling my so called failed functions. , Unresolved,0

Saturday September 7th 2013 8:41 pm -04:00,claudia if these are the arrows you are referring to the green arrow is the code that has just been executed and the red arrow is the code about to be executed. they dont necessarily step through the code sequentially one line after another as you might expect it all depends on what functions are being called. if from within one function another is called the program will jump to the function being called and complete that operation before proceeding farther (usually back to the function that requested the function it depended upon).paul talks about this in the first video lecture for week 3. it is a good one to watch a couple of times and also explains quite clearly what is going on with the frames concept as well. ps. this is a random example and not one from the class.top arrow (green?) is code just executedbottom arrow (red) is about to be executedif you step through the visualiser (even by going forward and backward over a couple of lines of code) and observe what is being displayed under  the frames and objects section on the right it should gel as to what is going on.      , Resolved,4

Saturday September 7th 2013 7:29 am -04:00,dear anon - thank you.the code example was from one of the vid quizzes. the question is why doesnt the print function appear in the GLOBAL FRAME ? ie. on the right hand side of the visualiser that displays the frames and heaps when you are stepping through the code im suspecting it may be due to print() being a built in function but i am not sure.  , Unresolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 8:41 am -04:00,uhm....i think you need to be a little more specific in the description of your problem here but...if the double number requires the correct answer in the first place why would you even bother with the double number ie. it seems as if you are saying that by using a double number you can fool the system but in order to fool the system you have to supply the correct answer anyway - seems to defeat the purposebut like i said i think you need to be more specific in your problem description because at the moment it seems vague.and to printscreen:mac = cmd + shift + 4 windows = windows 8 i use the snippet tool otherwise i think you use the printscreen function key, Unresolved,0

Saturday September 7th 2013 7:54 pm -04:00,iantype error is referring to data type errors not typing as in a typos error.for example you might be trying to perform string methods on integers. python does not require you to define the data types so you have to sort of be aware of which data types you are dealing with. go to python.org documentation for a full explanation of error messages., Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 4:33 am -04:00,you may have failed to use closing quotes on the string: ie. this: mystring or mystringthe string opens and closes with quotations  not: mystring or mystring the string has an opening quotation but no closing one , Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 4:48 am -04:00,because there was nothing in the description saying that the return value of the get_compliment() function should be restricted to being one character in length  and similarly because the get_complementary_sequence() function may be tested by a single value argumentie. may be required to return a single character i saw both functions as being one and the same. therefore the only difference between the two was the function name. if youve done one youve done them both.that is just my opinion though. ps. it works , Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 8:06 am -04:00,no the only reason two functions were created is because that is what was asked for in the assignment.In the real world you only need one function to do both things because the function should not fail on a single character test if it is a valid character. in effect if you create the get_complementary_sequence() you have also created the get_compliment() function by default.also and this is just my opinion but to say that something was inferred is entirely subjective.my interpretation of the statement was that it was a pre condition the input would be a valid character (ie. a nucleotide).  there was no explicit instruction that function get_compliment() return a single character answer.if you pass in a valid single character argument to get_complementary_sequence() you will get a single character returned and will not have broken any rules of  get_compliment()that is why only one function is needed to do both things in the real world.     , Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 9:22 am -04:00,does your get_complement function work ?you havent included it and your function calls it.did you run both functions through the visualiser or debugger to observe what was happening and test your code ?  , Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 9:40 am -04:00,kelvin if you submit print statements in the assignment it will fail you did you know that ? you need to return the values back to the function call not print them the function dependent on this one will not be receiving values at least thats how i understand it   , Resolved,1
Sunday September 22nd 2013 8:28 am -04:00,if the function was correct then there would not be a NameError.function being correct includes the way you have (or have not) initialised your variables. why dont you post the complete code so that we can see what you are talking about ?   , Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 5:42 am -04:00,yes and the possibilities are that if they are not true than they are false. there are only 4 characters that will have equality with the sequence and they are those within the sequence. you may be over complicating things. anything other than the characters in the valid sequence are false., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 6:58 am -04:00,i think item refers to the value at the index and index (obviously) refers to the index so if:L = [123]then:indices (plural of index) =  012 items = 123index 0 refers (item) 1index 1 refers (item) 2index 2 refers (item) 3the index and what it refers to are two entirely different things. , Resolved,4
Sunday September 22nd 2013 7:27 am -04:00,in my opinion its hard to know without seeing all the code.compress_list([a b c d])looks like a function call that requires a list passed in as its argument in this case it looks like your function identifier (or name) is compress_listhowevercompressed_list.append(L[i] + L[i + 1])looks like the append method is being called on a function that has the identifier of compressed_listso you have two different functions:1) compress_list2) compressed_listif you are using a while loop and have not set a bound whereby the method call will eventually terminate the loop will run until your machine runs out of memory.  for example:compressed_list.append(L[i] + L[i + 1])needs to be told when to stop.MemoryError is discussed in the documentation here: http://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html  this is my understanding so far anyway., Resolved,0

Sunday September 22nd 2013 8:00 am -04:00,yue your question isnt all that clear but are you saying that you were getting the final total summation correct but printing  every sub-total summation along the way ? also - you are coding in a .py file and running it to display in the shell ?if so then if you nest (ie. indent) the print statement inside the loop every value will print out in the shell (many values) - dont want to happenif you do not nest/indent the print statement inside the loop what will be printed is the final summation (one value) - do want to happen in other words the issue may be the way in which you are indenting the print statement. test on a single digit range value whose correctness you can calculate in your head first  - not one that has a 4 digit range value and is impossible to calculate in your head.using a for loop example:this - i = 0 # initialise the index to 0s = 0 # initialise the sum to 0for i in range(1102):	        s += i        print(s) will print every valueor this -  i = 0 # initialise the index to 0s = 0 # initialise the sum to 0for i in range(1102):        s += iprint(s)will print the final summation only  , Unresolved,0
