Monday August 26th 2013 8:19 am -04:00,A parameter is something that you specify in your function declaration.An argument is an specific value that is passed to a parameter in a function call.In other words an example in the Calculus realm may help. Suppose you define a function like this: f(x)=2x+1.Here the x in f(x) is the parameter to the function.Now suppose you want to evaluate that function in x=1 --> f(1)=2*1+1=3That 1 in f(1) is an argument to the function.In Python when you define a function say def myFunction (hi)    print hi;return;Here hi in myFunction (hi) is a parameter.When you call the function you will do something like this: myFunction (My name is John Doe)Here My name is John Doe is an argument. And you will get that message in the screen.Hope it helps., Resolved,1
