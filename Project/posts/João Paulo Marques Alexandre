Saturday August 31st 2013 1:54 pm -04:00,So are we or are we not supposed to for the get_hours functions to invoke the to_24_hour_clock? Because I just solved the get_hours by not invoking it.Remember that the / symbol divides a number and gives you a float while there is another symbol(s) that also divides the number but gives you an integer (look it up). This means that 3800 seconds which is actually a bit over an hour will round down to 1 hour (the integer instead of 1.X) which is what you need. But do not use the round function its not necessary.EDIT: My solution may be wrong but I have tested with a random number of seconds and for example: >>> get_hours(3800) 1So its working as intended by the description. Im now wrapping my head around the get_minutes though., Resolved,0
Saturday August 31st 2013 2:45 pm -04:00,Im happy and sad I found this thread and replies by Doan and Tom. This makes me realize I would never get the solution right Im on the verge of quitting as this is too much from my poor little head., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 3:21 pm -04:00,For anyone reading this and may not yet have understood the problem with the last quizz is that the solution to it doesnt fit well.return temp > 28 or temp < 12^ is the correct answer however look at it again. What if the temperature is between 12 and 28 for example 25?Well if you copy and paste this function into the IDLE editor save it then press F5 to run Module and call the function with 25 as temp it will amount to False also.def inhospitable_weather(temp):        (number) -> bool       Return True if and only if the given temperature in degrees Celsius      is unpleasant (too hot or too cold).           >>> inhospitable_weather(20)         False                 return temp > 28 or temp < 12On the Shell:inhospitable_weather(25)>>> False25 is a warm temperature so it should be pleasant.The point here is that there is no definition for numbers between 12 and 25., Resolved,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 2:38 pm -04:00,Etienne if you use 25 as the value for the function is_comfortable(temp) it returns False:>>>is_comfortable(25)False25 Celsius degrees is a pleasant and comfortable temperature therefore the solution to this exercise should not be correct but it is. The solution is the correct the problem is the approach that should have used another example. I understand it may be hard to come up with a simple example that we can understand at this stage., Resolved,0

Tuesday September 3rd 2013 6:00 pm -04:00,This is what I have.semi = (sidelength*3)/2area_hero = math.sqrt (semi*((semi-sidelength) ** 3))Shows up as incorrect.Am I supposed to import something?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 1:49 pm -04:00,Even though that is the solution thank you.Our solutions (me and the opener of this topic) are basically overkill or incorrect.Its actually as easy as adding the the module name with a dot before the function name. Of course its not easy or I would have figured out myself.This course is challenging to me., Unresolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 3:50 pm -04:00,Joaquin I made the same mistake as you did.I misread the use non-negative indices as being use negative indices.So like you I typed  s[-13:-9] and was wondering why it wouldnt work.Then I re-read the requirement of the exercise again and realized I should have been using non-negative indices.So use positive indices (from 0 to whatever is required)., Resolved,1
Monday September 9th 2013 4:43 pm -04:00,Refresh and see if you can see it now.If it doesnt it might be a temporay issue or your internet connection.One time I was trying to watch the videos and the loading of the videos was very slow. Upon checking general browing on the internet I found it was not a problem with my connection so it could be a temporary issue on your end.I, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 3:50 pm -04:00,According to Ettienne Papegnies in this thread get_complement is for strings of length 1 while the get_complementary_sequence is multi-string. Worry about multi-string in the last function., Resolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 3:08 pm -04:00,I started by opening the 3 notes files associated with the lecture. Did not get it. Then I watched the 34 minute lecture. I did not get it either. I understand what youre supposed to do but I didnt understand the code itself. I got sleepy after being totally confused trying to understand the code (which I couldnt).Oh boy. Perhaps Ill watch the lecture some other day a couple of more times. , Unresolved,6

Saturday September 28th 2013 7:22 am -04:00,You can do this with just one line of code.player_info[1] is the score of the player and its the only value you want to update.The way you can update something is with +=. So you need to update player_info[1] with the word.For that you should call the previous function word_score(word) into the updating you want done at player_info[1].So think about player_info[1] think about word_score(word) and how youre going to update one into the other., Unresolved,1

Saturday September 28th 2013 7:13 am -04:00,What a mess.After reading this sub-forum extensively I managed to get most functions right except read_words and read_board. This puts me at ~30/37 with code I either wrote mashed copied from somewhere else. If I am not progressing as in being able to come up with my own solutions then theres no point in slaving through something if youre not learning.At this point after spending 8 hours with this Im done. I dont even deserve my 30/37 score and I can barely look at the last two functions (read_words and read_board) as I only managed the previous nine with many hints and code from this sub-forum.Im either code-challenged or this is way challenging. I feel like theres a big gap between [lectures in-lecture exercises weekly exercise] and the assignment.Ive already had a stint or two with Python. I A couple of years ago I read and practiced most of the book Learn Python the Hard Way so I shouldnt feel like a beginner and yet thats what Im feeling right now.I may or may not look at the assignment again.Basically I have everything right up to read_words but not inclusive. I dont quite know where to start with it and how to return the values or print them in the shell to see if anything is working.This is not really a request more like venting.See you on the forums., Unresolved,4
Friday October 4th 2013 2:06 pm -04:00,Im also doing Think again: How to reason and argue a course here on Coursera. It is a bit dry at times due to the subject matter but the instructors make it worthwile. Im not sure it helped a lot but there were instances were the subject material was related. For example the material about conjunctions and disjunctions is related to True and False of the and and or Python features so that was easy to port over the knowledge.Thanks for the tip on An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python course I might take it although I am short on time., Resolved,0
