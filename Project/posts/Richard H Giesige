Monday August 19th 2013 1:02 am -04:00,Also there are a bunch of places to get themes for your python idle. Just Google IDLE themes and you will be able to find a couple. I have a preference for darker themes so I use this one: www.roguecode.net/2011/09/python-idle-themes.htmlI would love it if more people provided themes that they enjoyed to try out., Resolved,1
Monday September 9th 2013 1:04 am -04:00,That doesnt return False Eggs % 12 == 0 actually returns TRUE, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:46 pm -04:00,SandyJust do this to make the example simple to understand (I hope).>>> 12 % 12 == 0TrueNow the other part was doing a function which said that if the expression of eggs % 12 == 0 (I.e. is true) then return FALSE. So I think the confusion is in understanding that the eggs % 12 == 0 is not equal to the return of the function which was in the question.As @pickonrs said it is hard because we all answered the questions in peices and now I have to go back to picking up trash. , Unresolved,0
Monday September 9th 2013 1:00 am -04:00,Have you tried using the python visualizer to see what happens when you put the exact code in a script and execute it. http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=def+report_status(scheduled_time+estimated_time)%3A%0A++...Are you actually putting the function call (report_status(14.3 14.3)) in your script or are you calling it from the command line after doing run module with your function definition? If you are setting the report_status in the script then set it to a value and then print or just call the value you set in the shell. Something like output = report_status(14.3 14.3) and then on the python shell call either print(output) or type the word output into the shell and you will see that you are actually getting the right information. If you are calling report_status(14.3 14.3) you should see the return value show up under your call to the function as you are returning on time back to shell., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:40 pm -04:00,Easy to explain to you the input you are asking is not actually being answered. You set the age1 and age2 as variables and not inputs. When you actually use the input value it will return as a string (str) and not a integer (int) and then your tests will not work properly. If you look at the help for input it states input([Prompt]) -> string so input returns a string. what you wanted to do was write age1 = input(how old are you? ) and then answer the question by putting the value you want. so your code should have looked like>>> age1 = input(How old are you? )how old are you? 13>>> age2 = input(How old is your best friend? )How old is your best friend? 11>>> print(str(int(age1 + age2)))1311As you can see from my example it didnt actually do the math but concatenated the two variables together., Resolved,1
Sunday September 29th 2013 5:13 pm -04:00,Can someone post a example of what you are looking for?Karen:len(blah) reutrns the length of the array or string you provide it. So all your doing is making the range flexible to the value you are providing it. For example range(2 11 2) means that you are starting at 2 going to 10 (up to 11) and in increments of 2. While range(2 len(variable) 2) means that you are starting at 2 going up to the length of the variable and doing it in increments of 2. This type of use is really good when you are asking for input or going through a unknown such as a file full of different sized strings., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 4:26 pm -04:00,I have almost finished the assignment but Im getting an index issue on my column tests. I cant reproduce this using the board that is provided in the assignment 3 files. I would think that the board would be a square or rectangular fashion and not have random rows that are longer or shorter then the all the rest of the rows. So the board would look like[[A S] [S A]] or [[ASB][SAE]]Is this not true?P.S. Im able to play the game without a problem on my end., Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 4:45 pm -04:00,Your board should contain array of rows so you need each of the strings you have in a bracket  and the letters need to be indexs of those arrays so it should have for example it should look like this for the board[[E F J A J C O W S][D G K S R F D F F][A S R J D U S K L K][H E N D N D J W A][N S D N C N E O P][P M S N F H H J E][J E P Q Y N X D L]]board should print with this code:for i in range(len(board)):      print(board(i)Look like: [E F J A J C O W S][D G K S R F D F F][A S R J D U S L K][H E N D N D J W A][N S D N C N E O P][P M S N F H H J E][J E P Q Y N X D L], Resolved,1
Sunday September 29th 2013 4:57 pm -04:00,Tom: Thanks I did that so maybe you can answer my question at the top. I cant reproduce the problem that the automated tests reported:student: test_a3.Test_07_BoardContainsWordInColumn.test_05_word_end_colMethod Description:NoneMessage:ERROR: IndexErrorlist index out of rangeIf I do a board with a square or rectangular fashion this can not be reproduced. But if I do a board that is not square or rectangular I can.Â  So if the board is [[A S D F][ASD][ASDF] then I will get this error., Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 5:20 pm -04:00,Tom:I figured out what I was doing it was a little different than your answer. I had actually already done the length of the first row and not the number of rows. But I was checking for row 1 instead of row 0 because I made the mistake thinking that we always play with a board with more than one row. Ill mark this as solved now., Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 4:37 pm -04:00,did you define a prompt?such as prompt = input(Put my friends name here: ) prompt is then defined., Unresolved,1
Sunday September 29th 2013 5:00 pm -04:00,you need to assign a variable to that open otherwise you are just opening it and not retaining the information.so you should set something like>>> blah = open(/Users/kadi/Documents/X/kuulutus.rtf r)blah.readline() Hope this helps., Unresolved,2
