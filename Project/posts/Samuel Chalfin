Sunday August 18th 2013 10:13 pm -04:00,Im from Boston MA.  I am beginning to get sick of my job and my roommate does some programming so he recommended to me that I should try to learn a new skill to add to my resume.  If I enjoy it enough I will probably take more courses too and maybe even see if I can use the skills I learned in the workplace.,None,2
Monday August 19th 2013 1:58 pm -04:00,Exactly what was said above just different wording:Z keeps the same value until told to change.  Got to run a string that tells z that is has a new value., Resolved,5
Monday August 19th 2013 2:01 pm -04:00,Think of it as typing code with each line coming after the previous.  Each statement you say replaces the last.  Originally Z =5 but you have programmed the computer to now think z =10.  However Y still equals 6 since you have not typed a command to change the value for y.Everything keeps the same value until told to change.  Once you run that string that tells the computer that is has a new value then the variable will change., Resolved,6
Monday August 19th 2013 2:06 pm -04:00,If I remember the question correctly I believe that the code typed above had:>>> a = 4>>> b = 3.2>>> a = 7 (I dont remember the exact number here but the point is that the stored value for a has changed.See if you can solve it now.  The logic is similar to the other problem., Resolved,2
Tuesday August 20th 2013 10:50 am -04:00,Use PEMDAS or BOMDAS (they are mneumonics that both work)The Letters in PEMDAS stand for:P - Parenthesis E - ExponentsMD - Multiplication or Division from left to rightAS - Addition or Subtraction from left to rightThe following phrase helps students remember the PEMDAS rule further:Please Excuse (My Dear) (Aunt Sally).The letters in the word BODMAS stand for various operations.B - Stands for Bracket.O - Stands for OF or Orders (ie Powers and Square Roots etc.)D - Stands for Division.M - Stands for Multiplication.A - Stands for Addition.S - Stands for Subtraction, Resolved,5
Wednesday August 21st 2013 9:06 am -04:00,It seems like since there are so many students taking this course the staff would be overwhelmed if they had to hand correct each persons work.  So to make things easier they have the computer answer the questions and have this discussion board in case certain people have problems or people need clarification.Unfortunately the computer is just looking for the simple answers. Anything not exactly what it is looking for will be wrong even if you have answer and decided to elaborate.,None,1
Wednesday August 28th 2013 11:06 pm -04:00,Reread the question and look at the example they gave when using usa_city_temperature and Atlanta., Unresolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 11:43 pm -04:00,So there is a similar question to this on the exercise and I am wondering why something like this doesnt result in a syntax error when I put it into python.   I would think it would have to be what/s up instead.Does use of the triple quote allow one to use  inside the quotes without an error?, Resolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 11:58 am -04:00,You write one function and then when you submit it the computer evaluates how effective your function is at getting the correct answer given various scenarios.this is so you can get partial credit and see where your function may be off.For example your function may work and calculate hours but it may not be in the 24 hour clock format.  So your function will work if the input is 3600 seconds (seconds in an hour) or less but be incorrect if it is more than 3600 seconds., Resolved,2
Friday August 30th 2013 12:01 pm -04:00,There should be 2 exercises and one assignment.There is an exercise each week and larger assignments every other week (in addition to the weekly exercises), Unresolved,0

Thursday September 5th 2013 8:38 am -04:00,Once you evaluate the expression:  math_grade >= 50 or bio_grade >= 50 or cs_grade >= 50 it returns true.  The questions is asking you what you can deduce knowing this fact that the Bollean expression yields true.You cant say with 100% certainty that there was a passing grade (above 50) in each course.  All you know for sure is that one course was passed., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:27 am -04:00,We need to remember though that we cant compare values of two different types for ordering.We would receive an error if we tried to do 1< A even though the ASCII code for 1 comes before A., Resolved,3
Thursday September 12th 2013 1:03 pm -04:00,So I get what the question is asking and even go the right answer but I am confused why if s1 is banana and s2 is ana your expression should return 3.I can only find ana in banana twice even with having the middle a shared and used in both of my two instances of ana., Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 2:03 pm -04:00,I totally see that now thanks  the example is displaying what the expression should yield when you Write an expression that produces the index of the second occurrence of s2 in s1., Resolved,0
