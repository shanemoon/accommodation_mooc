Friday September 6th 2013 9:42 am -04:00,HiCan someone help me in running IDEL. Below are the codes I copied from Function Design Recipe. But I can not get the Idle to get the right answer and nothing come after I typed conver_to_celsius (32).... Am I missing something? Ning >>> def convert_to_celsius (fahrenheit):	 (number) -> numberReturn the number of celsius degrees equivalent to fahrenheit degrees.>>> return (fahrenteit -32) * 5 / 9>>> convert_to_celsius (32), Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 11:03 am -04:00,HiThanks for your response. Do you know in order to run IDLE you need to do run module always you can not just type function in IDLE. I am totally new to this and feel a bit stupid in asking question like this.Ning, Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 12:42 pm -04:00,Thank you JoseI finally got the sequence right. I was missing the key step of run module. Since I got your response and reviewed the last video of week 1 lecture and I tried it just now. IDLE does the job. I will keep practicing. Thanks again. I think I will continue this course.Ning, Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 3:11 pm -04:00,HelloI nee help to get this assignment started. I wrote for char in dna:if char in ATCG:get_length = len (str)return get_lengthAnd my answer is always 3. I know I did not do it correctly. So please help me.ThanksNing, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 3:57 pm -04:00,Hi TomThanks for your help. I will try but I dont really fully understand the code of string.count(substring). I will use help function.Ning, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 5:52 pm -04:00,Hi TomI understand the explanation you gave. Please read my code and tell me why I am not getting the right answer.>>> str = ATTGCC>>> str.count(A + T + C + G)0What am I missing???ThanksNing, Unresolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 6:04 pm -04:00,I tried a few different combinations and still can not get the right answer. I am totally stuck on this and time is running out....Ning, Unresolved,0

Sunday September 15th 2013 9:24 am -04:00,Hi KellyI understand the example mentioned above. But in this assignment count the nucleotides (ATGC) occurs in the DNA sequence. Python needs to count either A and T and C and G in order to get the answer correct. If I write dna.count(ATCG) Python would only count ATCG as a whole but not each base so the answer will come back as 1 not 4 I think I am missing some very fundamentally simple step here but I dont know which.Ning, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 9:50 am -04:00,HiIsnt the first question count nucleotide is to count the total number of nucleotide in the DNA sequence?, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 8:00 am -04:00,I got get-complement correctly but can not seem to be able reuse the function and I received an error message of return outside function.. Since I can not post my code maybe my question wont make sense at all. Can someone help I have been doing this assignment for two weeks now? Ning, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 9:27 am -04:00,Thanks I will try to move my return to the right, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 5:49 pm -04:00,Hi guysI am finally got the right code for this question. But when I submitted my answer I did not get the credit because I think I have submitted get-complement earlier and I did not remove the early submission. I just removed it and re-submit it again. I just want to say a big THANK YOU to all of you out there.Ning, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 6:00 pm -04:00,HaI was too excited too soon. Here is the error message I received:Message:ERROR: AttributeErrorReplacerModule object has no attribute get_complementary_sequenceI did test my code in IDLE and no problem I got all the right complementary sequence back.. Now I dont know what am I missing???Ning, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 22nd 2013 6:38 pm -04:00,THANK YOU!!! I did it... You are so right the function name is the reason....Great now I can finally get a good night sleep tonight...It has been tough.Ning, Unresolved,0
Thursday September 26th 2013 7:07 am -04:00,def count_adjacent_repeats(s):    (str) -> int    return the number of occurrence of a character and an adjacent chaaracter being the same.    >>> count_adjacent_repeats(aacdeffghh)    3        repeats = 0    for i in range (len(s) - 1):        if s[i] == s[i + 1]:            repeats = repeats + 1            return repeatsWhen I did this and my answer came back as 1.
