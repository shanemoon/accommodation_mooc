Monday August 26th 2013 7:11 pm -04:00,HelloI seem to get the exact values that should be expected by the docstring examples when testing the method so I doubt there is an error there., Resolved,5
Monday August 26th 2013 7:23 pm -04:00,Indeed 45 minutes is 0.75 hours and 9 seconds is 0.15 minutes. But if you convert that 0.15 minutes to hours you get 0.0025 hours. So adding the values up 2 + 0.75 + 0.0025 = 2.7525., Resolved,4

Tuesday August 27th 2013 11:23 am -04:00,Im pretty certain that the function to_24_hour_clock should not return 1.0 if you enter 13.0 as an argument it should return 13.0., Unresolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 1:45 pm -04:00,From the Assignment 1 handout: You can resubmit a1.py once every hour. Only your last submission will count. Notice that this means that you can submit a lot of times before the due date if you start early. You can even submit before youve finished all of the functions although the feedback will be incomplete., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 10:28 pm -04:00,Hi Tim1) The output of read_board(file) is indeed a list of lists that I believe looks like [[EFJAJCOWSS] [SDGKSRFDFF] etc...]. Note the outer brackets.2) Im sure that using the read_words function to start things off could work but I think it complicates the problem. For every index of the list (I am referring to the return value of the read_words function) you would have to create a new list that stores each individual character and then append those new lists to another list. This would require a nested loop to achieve. But wouldnt the same amount of work required to process the input file? (for every line in the input file you would have to create a new list that stores each individual character and then append those new lists to another list) So basically as far as I can tell you just change the format of the input without any real gain. , Unresolved,2
Wednesday September 25th 2013 6:17 am -04:00,Try calling help(print) in a python shell. By default the method print appends the newline character () to the evaluated arguments. In the case of the video when reading the file at the end of each line there was already a . So if you call the print function with the default end= you will get one empty line after every file-read line. If you do go with end= you dont add an empty line after every file line, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 4:03 pm -04:00,Exactly so when entering end= the carriage(I think this is the right word?) will remain where it is left by the string argument., Resolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 6:45 am -04:00,Hi Pedro this seems to be working for me.example([1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9])Or you can try (basically the same thing)L = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]example(L), Unresolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 7:30 am -04:00,I dont believe any line can have  only. Heres the precondition set in the docstring:    Precondition: Each line of the file contains a word in uppercase characters    from the standard English alphabet.If the file has an empty line that should mean that the file has ended. Also I believe the linefor line in readme:if altered a bit to comply to the docstring (file open for reading) -> list of strreads each line in the file., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 7:57 pm -04:00,What does words_file refer to when you call: line = words_file.readline()? It seems like it is a string when to use readline you need an open file I believe., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 1:42 pm -04:00,Hi RAJUWhat you are doing is assigning a score to the player. You are not updating the score. For example if the player already has some points and he gets another correct word are you adding up his scores or are you just giving him the score of the second word?, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 3:32 pm -04:00,I think you misunderstand what player_info represents. It is a [str int] list not a list of [str int] lists. See the difference? There is no need for you to determine who the correct player is. All you need to do is update the score on the single list that the function is given via the arguments., Unresolved,2
Wednesday September 25th 2013 4:28 pm -04:00,To check for a palindrome you need to check the first half of the string with the second half. If its length is even then we check the first character with the last the second first with the second last etc... until we reach the middle of the string (e.g. In noon we check n at index 0 with n at index -1 etc...) so we need to make this check len(s) // 2 timesIf its length is odd then we dont care about the middle character (e.g. In civil we dont care about the character v) so the checks are again equal to len(s) // 2.In the mystery function after the for loop completes if the variable matches is equal to the times the loop ran then the word is a palindrome. The loop of course runs len(s) // 2 times so if matches == (len(s) // 2) then s is a palindrome., Unresolved,10

Wednesday September 25th 2013 2:24 pm -04:00,Wherever you see board in those two sentences it means the return of the function. Also yes you should not include the newlines in that board., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 2:34 pm -04:00,Well the return will have to be a list of list of str as stated in the docstring. So you need to rethink in terms of lists and not in terms of strings. To be more specific the lists of str inside the outer list are going to contain the lines of the input file (each list = one line).Also as to my previous response I am afraid I was partly wrong. When it says that The board file will contain it means the input file and not the board returned., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 4:44 pm -04:00,How can you evaluate the values of a list using their indices? e.g. You want to get the value at index 4 L = [a b c d e]What expression do you use to do so?If you find out and apply this for the two dimensional list given you should manage to do it in a single statement., Resolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 7:51 pm -04:00,Pretty sure you dont need to test that case since this is how the function is called from the a3_driver.py file:for row_idx in range(len(board)):        print(a3.make_str_from_row(board row_idx))As you can tell row_idx is always a valid argument to make_str_from_row., Unresolved,1
