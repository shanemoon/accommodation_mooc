Tuesday September 3rd 2013 2:59 am -04:00,I also faced this issue Just not giving the answer but you can think that :25h = 1h24h = 0h27 = 3h etcthis will solve your problem., Unresolved,1
Sunday September 8th 2013 1:07 am -04:00,Just an observation In the doc string while writing the report_status(scheduled_timeestimated_time): method we added preconditions : Pre-condition :  0.0 <= scheduled_time < 24  0.0 <= estimated_time < 24 But when I see the implementation we have never verified the pre-conditions. May be we should add couple of if clauses to verify that both the input times are between 0 to 24.Just a thought!!   , Unresolved,0
Sunday September 8th 2013 3:39 am -04:00,In fact as a good programming practice we should always check if the pre-conditions are met. If not we should not proceed with the rest of the body of the function and throw exception., Unresolved,0
