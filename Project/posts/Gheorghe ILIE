Tuesday October 1st 2013 12:29 pm -04:00,There is no mention of 11:59:00am as the deadline. The posted deadline is 11:59 am which means that as long as the clock shows 11:59 am the submission should be accepted. I interpreted the 11:59 am deadline as just before noon as is usually interpreted.Â Eventually the deadline should be specified on the webpage with more accuracy., Unresolved,-2
