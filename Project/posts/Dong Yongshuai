Tuesday August 27th 2013 10:43 am -04:00,I think the pre-condition means you should make sure the argument is >=0 when you call this function. to_24_hour_clock(-1) works from calculation perspective. If a negative value is passed to to_24_hour_clock() though you get the correct result it does not meet requirement. There may need extre code in to_24_hour_clock() to check the pre-condition I guess., Resolved,1
Tuesday September 17th 2013 8:14 am -04:00,I cant give a thorough answer. Just some explnantion for the example in the first post:len() is a built-in functions which means it is always available. builtins.len() is the full name for the built-in function len().We can use it like:     len(abc)Or:    import builtins    builtins.len(abc) Refer to builtins in Python Documentation: http://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.htmlBut len() is NOT a method of type string. We can check it by dir(str). So we cant use it like str.len(abc), Unresolved,2
