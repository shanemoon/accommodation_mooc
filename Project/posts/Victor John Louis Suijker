Sunday September 1st 2013 2:31 pm -04:00,HelloAfter pondering for a long time how to write the code required for Courseras week 2 assignment I get a score of 5/41 even though all the examples and a1_gui.py combined with my a1.py run without error together and produce the clocks.When I run the module and test the examples they all seem to work. The automated grading system does not seem to recognize my work.Wishing to successfully complete this course in order to receive the Statement of Accomplishment I was wondering if you could look into this matter.If my .py document is requested to be send please let me know via: victorsuyker@gmail.com.Kind regards!, Resolved,0
