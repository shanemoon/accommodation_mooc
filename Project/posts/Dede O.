Sunday September 22nd 2013 12:20 pm -04:00,I actually support this idea of yours. Its a good one. It should be explained in the Video Lectures! :(Ive spent hours trying to get that question 9 right ... :( and I havent!When the deadline is past I hope the right answer would be told to us and an explanation too [theres an alternative way to get the question right and I feel its unfair that Im being penalized for not getting it correct because Im using the wrong alternative which is in fact right.]. I hate to quit but i definitely QUIT on this question. I quit! quit! quit!!! :(, Unresolved,-1
