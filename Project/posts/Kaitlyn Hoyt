Friday August 30th 2013 7:11 pm -04:00,I am confused by this quiz question in Function Reuse:Write a one-line expression that calls both convert_to_celsius and usa_city_temperature. It should give the temperature in Seattle (an American city) in Celsius. Be careful about capitalization and spelling!I think that it is asking to call both functions on the same line?Looking at the example in the video I see:max(area(3.8 7.0) area(3.5 6.8))It calls both the max and area functions as a one-line expression.So my answer was: convert_to_celcius(usa_city_temperature(Seattle))However this is incorrect.What am I doing wrong here? ThanksKaitlyn, Resolved,1

Monday September 2nd 2013 12:52 am -04:00,Python is supposed to be one of the easier languages to learn.I think some of the difficulty is that the course cant take time to teach Python because it is a course to learn the fundamentals of designing programs and how they work.Dont worry too much about Python you will learn that on the way and after the course. The main thing that you need to learn are the concepts that are being introduced like the design recipe.It is hard I think it is realistic to expect to spend  5-15 hours a week if you are new to programming. You will need to keep watching the videos read keep trying and ask questions. There are hints in the questions and instructions read them 4 times or more until you figure it out. You also get 5 tries with exercises and you can look at what you got wrong and see hints. Plus the assignment can be submitted an unlimited amount of times.I think everyone finds this hard that is new to programming. As long as you are learning something then its not a waste of time. If you give up then you wont learn anything. :), Resolved,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 3:56 pm -04:00,In assignment 2 for count_nucleotides I keep getting this error.I have tried many variations of things like this:return count_nucleotides.count(dna nucleotide);I keep watching the video lecture str Methods and it clearly shows at about 2:12 in the video white_rabbit.count(ate)Using this I tried many variations similar to this:count_nucleotides.count(nucleotide);No matter what I put I still get the same error. The other 3 functions were very easy for me and I did them correctly the first time.I could use some help. :)Thank you., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 4:21 pm -04:00,Thank you I realize that it is not a string however I have tried this as well:count_nucleotides.count(nucleotide); Do you mean that i should not be using count at all in this situation?I have tried about everything over the past 5 hours trying to figure this out with .count. I am basing this off of  the video lecture str Methods where it shows at about 2:12 in the video white_rabbit.count(ate), Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 1:16 am -04:00,I am not sure why I am finding this difficult as I have completed the other functions and assignments correctly. Im sure that I am missing something tiny that is making this much harder than it is. I have dedicated myself to completing this course.I am still lost after about 8 hours on this. I have tried everything in every combination using .count that I could think of even things that I knew were incorrect just to see what it would do or if I was getting closer. Ive even found a bug in Idle that causes it to crash the entire computer every time that the shell runs the function as well stranger  error codes such as: <built-in method count of tuple object at 0x02B0C3A0>Should I be using .count at all? Are you saying that I need to use .count but change the variables into a string? How many lines should the body be? Where should I look to find this since the video lecture str Methods isnt the correct example?Thank you., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 1:35 pm -04:00,Thank you for your reply Francis. :)I was actually on step 2 I didnt make it to step 3 yet and step 2 said:For these functions you may use built-in functions str operations (for example: in + indexing) and str methods, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 1:22 pm -04:00,Thank you! I have wasted so much time on that. :)No wonder I was so confused I thought they were saying .count would only work on a str and not a variable. Now I know it can be used and how .count actually works. I wish that there had been more examples in the video lecture I am learning only from there since I cant afford the book and Google was useless., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 2:24 pm -04:00,Thank you so much for this. I would have spent hours longer trying to figure this out when I was only a character off. This is the perfect balance of providing guidance without giving away the answer. :), Unresolved,0
