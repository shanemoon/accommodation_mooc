Monday August 19th 2013 8:03 am -04:00,Same here. and I have another course having the exactly same problem. and it seems to be a problem caused by NetEase(网易) the video host for mainland China area. Someone reported and explained the problem in the forum of that course Ill just copy andpost it here:Coursera has many nodes to host the videos. In China we watch lecture videos hosted by NetEase. But some video files of on NetEase servers are lost. According to incomplete statistics Lecture 2.2 and 2.5 are not available in China now. https://class.coursera.org/socialpsychology-001/forum/thread?thread_id=1881     Some students said they had changed their browser or player format and didnt work. I think its not related to browsers or player formats. I guess Coursera assigns nodes by visitors IPs. Such as Chinese IPs → NetEase. So I cleaned cookies and caches    of my web browser and visited Coursera via a proxy server (GoAgent) then they were available again. I found the media stream was on Amazon CloudFront and was fine. the original post is here: https://class.coursera.org/socialpsychology-001/forum/thread?thread_id=2087 and its posted by Cong Xu., Resolved,3
Tuesday August 20th 2013 8:27 am -04:00,The problem summary: the videos wont play in either HTML5 or Flash format. and changing the browser makes no difference--chrome IE firefox and safari have all been used. And its only affecting viewers from mainland China very probably because we are automatically assigned to the video host NetEase.Another course I take has the same problem with some of the videos. Someone reported and explained the problem in the forum of that course Ill just copy and post it here along with the screenshot he/she provided in that post: Coursera has many nodes to host the videos.

Its really preventing us from completing the courses especially when there are in-video quizzes. Thanks really!, Resolved,4

Wednesday August 21st 2013 1:13 am -04:00,thanks thats a relief. but I still hope this technical problem can be solved soon so that we can fully enjoy the course after all the quizzes are still part of the experience though it wont be graded>.< , Resolved,1
Monday August 26th 2013 12:20 am -04:00,well actually its been 2 weeks...other courserians and I have reported the problem in another courses forum a week ago...no offence but seems the technical staffs are not working on it..., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 10:06 pm -04:00,yes I know we can download the videos. but the problem is still there and we literally lose the option to watch it online and solve the quizzes along with the videos.anyway I truly believe if theres a technical problem it should be solved no matter whether there are other options for the users.and actually another course I take wont allow us to download the videos because of intellectual properties in that case Courserians who do not know how to use VPN or other technical skills to assign himself/herself an IP other than mainland China would lost the chance to follow the course because some of the videos are lost on the host.ps.I myself could use VPN but I just cant stand the problems being there with no one to solve it for other non-technical users....., Resolved,1
Tuesday August 27th 2013 10:26 pm -04:00,I dont mean to be push or offensive or anything if you feel any.....just want it to be solved...but thanks really for the reply! at least we know there are people helping us to solve it thanks:), Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 12:24 am -04:00,This is a different problem from what you said....I know about the internet restrictions here in China. and I AM ABLE to use VPN. the problem I reported here is due to the video host NetEase(网易) they have lost some files not all but some. well in this course all the files are lost...in other courses just some of the files lost.so this is a problem they can solve at least by contacting NetEase. and it probably has nothing to do with the GFW or other restrictions set up by the government., Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 1:38 am -04:00,oh sorry havent noticed your edited message....its ok to download the videos without using VPNs its directly from the Coursera site were not switched to NetEase server., Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 1:46 am -04:00,thanks!and I added a screenshot in the post so that the technical staffs would see it more clearly if new thread is to be posted to them.thank you really., Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 2:04 am -04:00,A Courserian named Zhong Xun also explained the problem in another post Ill just copy and paste his/her answer here for your information:)http://183.221.245.14/v.coursera.126.net/spark-public/programming1/recoded_videos%2F1functionsNEW.3d4cfbc018021c43f7a434a1c1915aa5.webmone of the video redirects to the URL above which is a 404 error. Either Netease dont have the file or the redirect mechanism is flawed.If your IP is within mainland china the video will be hosted by CDN network of NetEase the banner of the video player would tell you it is hosted by NetEase. http://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/183.221.245.14But since the files are missing you may not watch these videos live.In fact Amazon Cloud is not blocked in China right now so the download links are working.Thats why most fellow students of the class will not experience this problem as long as your IP is out of china. Because you are using amazon cloud service. Thats how CDN network works., Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 3:42 am -04:00,Hi Etienne its two weeks ago I cant say its exactly 14 days ago but my reply to a post in the other course was posted 13 days ago and I remember I waited a day or two until went to the forum for help.And thats when I and other friends and also other Courserians noticed that video hosted by 网易 appeared on the right top of the video page opened. Before that the videos were all fine and as some have found out they were all hosted by Amazon previously and were not blocked by technical barriers from the government to watch it online or download from it. Later that week some courserians used their technical skills and found that on NetEase they cannot find files of those lectures we are unable to watch  (shown in the screenshot above) while those files on the Amazon host are complete. Thats why we can download the files without the VPNs help for thank God its directly from Coursera (Amazon) not from NetEase...But when watching were automatically assigned to the NetEase host.And in other courses only two or three videos are unavailable but in this course seems all are lost quite interesting..., Resolved,0

Thursday August 29th 2013 10:42 am -04:00,Hi EtienneI got a reply from the staff in another post from the forum of Social Psychology he said: We have pushed a fix that may alleviate the problem somewhat (that is if we cannot pull the video off NetEases servers then we will fallback to using our global CDN).And I tested the lectures in that course its working now. first the videos got the same 00:00 problem but soon it flash a little bit and then begin to load guess its redirecting to Amazon.But the videos in this course havent got fixed and I dont know about other courses hoping theyre working to it:), Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 9:07 pm -04:00,Hi EtienneIts working now!Many thanks:D, Resolved,0
