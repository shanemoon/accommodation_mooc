Thursday August 29th 2013 10:29 am -04:00,hey guys im having a little trouble with the first part of the assignment SECONDS DIFFERENCEMy math is all correct when i calculate the differences between the two numbers but for some reason it wont show a negative difference like in the example in the docstring am i doing something wrong?for example: (5000.0 1000.0) should read according to the example -4000 but instead mine would read 4000, Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 10:39 am -04:00,yes i tried return max(time_1 time_2) - min(time_1 time_2)but i see this only returns the difference not whether its negative or not, Resolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 8:56 am -04:00,In this part of the assignment is it ok to use other functions like round? I ask because my returned answers are floats but in my examples they should return as integersOr is this the wrong way to do this?, Resolved,0

Friday August 30th 2013 9:49 am -04:00,Im confused with the get_seconds part of the assignmentSurely if your using the parameter (seconds) then you would just need the code to return seconds by my standards this seems to easy because the code you would write would be simply... Return SecondsIs this the case? or am i failing to pick up on something?, Resolved,0
Friday August 30th 2013 10:02 am -04:00,Hey Susanneit helps in the sense that i now know ive done something wrong haha Maths was never my strong point which i suppose doesnt help in programming is there anyway you could dumb it down a little?Are you saying that if i was to pass the argument 62 seconds to the function that it should return 0 hours 1 minute 2 seconds?I guess im just confused as to what kind of answer should be returned reallyThanks!, Resolved,0
