Tuesday August 20th 2013 4:13 pm -04:00,ha I just moved out of muncie to Indianapolis!  Just graduated from Ball State with an MFA in animation.  Python is used in the software I use to build tools or streamline tedious processes So I would like to learn how to use it.  Plus leaning how to program has been on the todo list for a while,None,0

Monday August 26th 2013 3:23 pm -04:00,I also think the question is confusing.  I get that number is too general and includes an int and a float.  but I chose to use the term string instead of str since the examples were going with general terms like number.  I knew the answer was (str) -> int  but I kept trying to use (string) -> number or (string) -> int and so on.It would have been super helpful to have that explanation before all my quiz tries were exhausted.  Or a help box after 2 incorrect tries.  Like I said I used string because the example also used a generic term like number, Resolved,3
Thursday September 5th 2013 12:02 pm -04:00,so I went through the entire assignment fairly easy once I started to get a handle on things.  It was pretty rough when I started a few days ago but I seemed to have figured it out.I submitted it all and the only thing that gives me failures is to_float_hours!  but the issue is that the answer close enough that I dont know whats going on.for this call:>>> to_float_hours(2 45 9) the answer is supposed to be 2.7525 but I end up getting 2.9Im not sure what Im doing wrong.  , Resolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 12:36 pm -04:00,I checked code and Im always getting the nonetype error.  I checked other peoples code and it seems to be similar so Im not real sure whats going on.  Help is appreciated.def get_complement(nuc):    (str) -> str    returns a nucleotides compliment    >>>get_compliment(T)    A        if nuc is T:        return A    if nuc is A:        return T    if nuc is G:        return C    if nuc is C:        return Gdef get_complementary_sequence(nucl):    (str) -> str    leta =     for char in nucl:        leta = leta + get_complement(char)    return letathis is the error.Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#0> line 1 in <module>    get_complementary_sequence(ATGC)  File /home/bubs/downloads/a2.py line 111 in get_complementary_sequence    leta = leta + get_complement(char)TypeError: Cant convert NoneType object to str implicitly, Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 12:55 pm -04:00,cool.  so I changed is to == and it works but why didnt is work?  arent they supposed to be similar?, Resolved,0
Monday September 30th 2013 12:39 pm -04:00,Im behind in this course.  Im not worried about the certificate or anything I just wanted to learn python. but other priorities jumped up.  No big deal. However since I am behind is the class still going to be available after next week?  like can I submit assignments for evaluation?  not for a grade but to see if Im right?  and will I get to watch the rest of the video lectures?,None,1
