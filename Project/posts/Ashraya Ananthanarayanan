Wednesday September 11th 2013 5:02 pm -04:00,I submitted my assignment yesterday and checked that everything is working fine in IDLE and the Visualizer. But the Auto Grader shows  my raw score as 0.00/41 which is confusing for me. I am assuming it is the grader issue. Is anyone else facing the same issue?, Unresolved,0
