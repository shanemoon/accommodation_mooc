You can get some additional practice on platforms like Codacademy:http://www.codecademy.com/I do think this course is very good for people starting out. Its extremely well presented and well structured. ,None,2

Saturday September 28th 2013 9:07 am -04:00,The difficult and at the same time easy thing about this assignment is that the functions are interrelated: With difficult I mean once you make a mistake in a function such as board_contains_word_in_column it will cause the functions boards_contains_word and num_words_on_board to be wrong. Easy refers to the fact that once you get the basis right such as board_contains_word_in_column the follow-up functions will be easy to solve. So dont feel done. Get it over and done with! No reason to feel discouraged. Still plenty of time left for this assignment! , Unresolved,0
