Thursday October 3rd 2013 4:54 pm -04:00,I tested read_board using the text file provided (board1.txt) along with a .txt file with only one line and a .txt file with 2 lines of unequal lengths. The program returned a list of list of string appropriately.  However after submitting my program this component failed. I am at a loss;  I can provide my code off forum if there is a way to do so.  Thank you, Resolved,0

Did you get rows and columns mixed up?Ive tested with square and rectangular boards; with one line boards; with a one character board.  Each time the correct list of list of str is created for the board.  I dont lose characters I dont have rows and columns reversed on the output.  Im not certain why I am receiving these error messages.  Any help would be appreciated., Resolved,0
