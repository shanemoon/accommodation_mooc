Wednesday September 18th 2013 12:56 pm -04:00,So I want to make sure I am understanding what is going on when we use % 10 for this question:For example one of the answer choices is: message = Happy 29th!new_message = for char in message:    if char.isdigit():        new_message = new_message + str((int(char) + 1) %10)    else:        new_message = new_message + charprint (new_message)At the point in the code that says str((int(char) + 1) %10)Starting from the inside out is this saying 1. (char + 1)  means the 2 in 29 goes to a 3 and make the 9 go to a 102.(char) + 1) %10) means the mod (%) of 3 is 3 and the mod(%) of 10 is 0 = 303.(int(char) + 1) %10) means to turn that into an integerI might have got the order wrong but is that the general idea?, Resolved,0
