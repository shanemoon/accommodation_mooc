Friday August 30th 2013 4:43 am -04:00,works but something is wrong coz number of iterations is -2 :) (example: if you input number of iteras = 5 then final result will be first/second number + 3 more iterations! first/second numbers are precondition! after that must count iterations.,None,0
Friday August 30th 2013 5:35 am -04:00,same problem again! if you input first second numbers different from 0 1 in final result missing second number! :),None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 1:50 pm -04:00,same here only Error in Assignment. My function return False if input string is  (empty)test_is_valid_sequence_zero_length will be glad if for next assignment tested parameters for functions will be defined before. Actually after my attempt to implement protection against low and cap letters auto.test return more errors and I must remove this section from final version of code :) , Resolved,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 2:03 pm -04:00,Jim I wrote my code exactly same - for any chars other then ACGT (low cap special and etc) to return False immediately but also wrote function body to return False for  (empty) string and receive error in test :) Who is right? (that is question :D ) - Staff defined rules in test or people think that is not right to suppose that zero length string is valid DNA sequence?regardsPS. actually I froze further attempts and now my assignment is 23/24 points. Easily can fix this but havent desire :D , Resolved,2
Thursday September 26th 2013 12:31 pm -04:00,def board_contains_word(board word):     (list of list of str str) -> bool    Return True if and only if word appears in board.    Precondition: board has at least one row and one column.    >>> board_contains_word([[A N T T] [X S O B]] ANT)    True    >>> board_contains_word([[A N T T] [X S O B]] COS)    False    how to interpret this error? what not in middle mean? docstring is about present in board nothing about place of this present!?student: test_a3.Test_08_BoardContainsWord.test_04_word_not_in_middleFAILURE, Resolved,0
