Sunday September 15th 2013 7:36 am -04:00,I think theres actually pretty good reason for empty string to be considered valid. And it is easy yo understand once you consider the results of adding valid and invalid sequences. So imagine we have strings Valid and Invalid then their sum Valid+Invalid must be invalid and return False since there are wrong symbols inside. But if the Invalid is actually  then the sum must be Invalid despite the fact that Valid+==Valid. So for the sake of consistency and greater good  must return True., Resolved,-1

Thursday September 12th 2013 11:19 am -04:00,Hi there Fox Yu. The problem is possibly not in the code but in the amount of whitespace from left border. Python uses indentation to replace some syntax. You can always just dedent problematic code completely and then indent it with tabulation as necessary. if the code is inside the function thats one tab. if its inside the loop or if else clause thats another tab on top of function tab., Resolved,0
