Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:57 am -04:00,I am having failure on my assignments on this specific test case. Correct me if Im wrong this is my idea about the question.>>> get_complement(A)T>>> get_complement(C)G>>> get_complement(G)C>>> get_complement(T)AIm supposed to return the complement of the given nucleotideright? , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:06 am -04:00,Thanks John Its just the above is exactly my output in IDLE but when I submit itthe test.case still mark it as failure., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:08 am -04:00,BTW I used if else in my function to determine the given nucleotide and output its complement, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:53 am -04:00,No I didnt use print statement. it is as simple as If nuc == A then return T.pretty much like that  , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:54 am -04:00,Yup pretty much the above is my output at IDLE., Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 10:48 am -04:00,Can I post my code here? so everyone can see it?, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 10th 2013 11:24 am -04:00,Thanks for all the help guys.Ill try my new code once i can submit again.Ill be posting here what happened. Its 11pm here in the Philippines.I will hit the bed and be back in a couple of hours. , Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 8:31 am -04:00,def get_complement(nucleotide):     (str) -> str        The first parameter is a nucleotide (A T C or G).    Return the nucleotides complement.        >>> get_complement(A)    T    >>> get_complement(C)    G    >>> get_complement(G)    C    >>> get_complement(T)    A        complement =         if nucleotide is A:        complement = T    elif nucleotide is T:        complement = A    elif nucleotide is C:        complement = G    elif nucleotide is G:        complement = C    return complementthis is my code on get_complement but Im still getting thisHave you tested your function with all 4 nucleotides?Message:FAILURE: AssertionError != T+ T : Have you tested your function with all 4 nucleotides?any idea why?, Resolved,1
