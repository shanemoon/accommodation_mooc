Wednesday August 21st 2013 5:40 pm -04:00,It would be very interesting to get some information on the statistics you get from that survey. Is it possible to create a short table with the representation of these results? (or at least some of them). I is also interesting to know how many people are enrolled to the course.Thank you in advance for considering our wishes. Rom@n,None,0

Wednesday August 21st 2013 5:33 pm -04:00,Hello I don´t understand how it is possible to get 13 from 14 in  the Pre Course Survey Getting to Know when I did respond to all 14 questions. As I understand in this kind of survey it is not possible to give a wrong answer. So the result should be 14.00/14.00 (even if  the marking will not be considered for the overhole result)I would like to know if someone else hier has experienced the same issue? And if YES may be some thechnical implementations should be checked by the survey creators. Thank you.BRRomanP.S. A similar thread has been already mentioned (https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=160 and https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=56) by some cource participants however the answer to the question was not very satisfactory in my opinion.  Maybe it is better to fix the isseu to avoid similar questions in future. , Resolved,0
Wednesday August 28th 2013 4:17 pm -04:00,Hello  I have the following issue: I did attemp both of the quizzes within the lecture Function Reuse and both of them have been done without mistakes however the message in green Quiz Attempted is not shown.  (see the pic below)It seems to be a coursera bug. @Jenni Paul - will this issue influence the final result of the course? Thanks for an answer in advance. BRRom@n, Resolved,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 3:28 pm -04:00,I did ask similar question myself as well. I did removed the text in red guide statements as soon as a question has been answered. The assignment 1 has been submited without any guide statements. Hopefully it will not be counted as an error. @Jen and Paul: please could you let us know if it was a right decision to remove that text marked in red? should we leave it between the cods in future? how will it influance a final result/feedback?Thank you for your answer. Rom@n, Resolved,1
Sunday September 22nd 2013 3:15 pm -04:00,I get the following message as a result to the assigment test:Method Description:Have you tested your function with a valid DNA sequeunce that uses        all the nucleotides?Message:FAILURE: AssertionErrorFalse is not true : Have you tested your function with a valid DNA sequeunce that uses            all the nucleotides?I did try to test all the possible combinations of the DNA sequenses incl (empty sequence) and   ATCG (with an empty space in between)and all off them give the result as it should be  however I have got 23/24 all the time.  I am really out of the ideas what else should I check and what the failure message could mean.Any explanations are appriciated. Thanks, Unresolved,0
