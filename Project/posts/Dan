Sunday September 1st 2013 7:47 pm -04:00,I run an apple the columns I show are summaries mid summaries fail all .  currently it says I have 20 of 42 but when you open it up everything says failure.  Not sure what it is suppose to look like but gut says something is not working...not concerned about the score I am submitting as I go but not sure how the table is reading, Unresolved,0
