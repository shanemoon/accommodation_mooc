Monday August 19th 2013 2:32 am -04:00,Hi there I realise this may be a pretty silly question but I am a total beginner so I am really just trying to order things in my head. I enjoyed the first week videos because it was really all from the start. But I just have one question related to the last video. I dont understand how come we just saved a file with a random name (i didnt even call mine triangle.py) and then the definitions were used in the Shell window? I am not looking for a super in depth understanding but I just want to understand a little more so I know what are the limitations if any? Does the file have to be saved anywhere in particular? How do these files relate?Thank you for your help. , Resolved,0

Monday September 23rd 2013 11:13 pm -04:00,Hi everybodyThis course is my first serious experience with coding ever. I have been enjoying the lectures and the exercises so far. After each week of exercises I was very happy because I managed to do them fairly well and most importantly I knew what I was doing and why.The humble Week 5 however has given me some headache. I watched all videos twice already but every question in the exercise is a bit of a guess. I dont seem to really get the questions I cant see the connections between the things in the lecture and the questions in the test.I am not sure what I should do but I thought I should share in the attempt to feel like I am not alone in my fight :),None,6
Tuesday September 24th 2013 4:27 am -04:00,I left the exercises for an afternoon and I will give it another try later this evening. I hope it will give some time for the magic networks in my brain to work their magic. Thanks for sharing your experience with me it really helps to keep the motivation up.CheersMaya,None,0
