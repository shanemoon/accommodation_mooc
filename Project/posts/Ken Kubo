Monday August 19th 2013 2:33 am -04:00,I have Windows 7 too and I found IDLE by checking the program folder from the lower left window. IDLE gets installed with the python windows installer. Here are some screenshots:First after clicking the Windows icon in the lower left corner of the screen.Second click on All Programs on the lower left to bring up the program folders.In the Python 3.3 folder (click on the folder icon) I can see IDLE - clicking on that icon will open IDLE.Does this work for you?, Resolved,5
Sunday September 22nd 2013 7:58 pm -04:00,Using IDLE to decipher a[1] = a[1][0]I used IDLE to help me understand what a[1][0] means.I started with the same question set-up:>>> a = [1 2 3]>>> b = aNow I checked what a and b refer to:>>> a[1 2 3]>>> b[1 2 3]Next this is what happens when b[1] = AB>>> b[1] = AB>>> b[1 AB 3]>>> a[1 AB 3] #So now the item at index 1 is AB for both list a and list bNow I can see what a[1][0] does:>>> a[1][0]AMy interpretation: a[1] points to index 1 in list a which is AB. The added [0] points to index 0 in AB which is A. So a[1][0] = A., Resolved,2
