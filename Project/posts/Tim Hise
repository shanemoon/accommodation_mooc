Monday September 9th 2013 8:08 pm -04:00,I saw - Trace the code by hand (on paper) and then use the visualizer or debugger to verify your trace. Tracing by hand is an important skill in programming as painful as it can be.Can someone explain what this means.  Im trying to fathom when this would be the best approach.  Kinda sounds like a joke to be honest., Unresolved,1
Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:35 pm -04:00,Thanks for your response Tom.  Im still missing something tho.  This says to trace it by hand and then use a visualizer or debugger.  I do understand what the code does... I just still dont get what tracing does.  , Unresolved,0
