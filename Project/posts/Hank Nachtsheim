Sunday September 1st 2013 10:51 am -04:00,I have what appears a simple syntax problem but cannot find the answer to the solution anywhere. When I use the symbol ->  without the quotes of course I get a syntax error statement and cannot proceed past that point. For example SyntaxError: invalid syntax>>> def seconds_difference(time_1 time_2):    (number number) -> number    SyntaxError: invalid syntaxWhat am I doing wrong and  how do I correct so I can move on? Thanks, Pinned Resolved,0
