Sunday September 15th 2013 2:58 pm -04:00,The reason for that is probably that the last time you modified your code you introduced a Syntax Error somewhere in the file.When that happens the autograder cannot use the file at all and therefore all the tests are showing as failure.Try and run your file as a module in IDLE if there is a SyntaxError somewhere it wont run and IDLE should highlight the source of the problem., Unresolved,0
