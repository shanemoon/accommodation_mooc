Thursday October 3rd 2013 7:54 pm -04:00,Hello AllFirst let me just say thank you to everyone who has participated especially the TAs and community members. While I havent posed in the forums until now the questions and discussions have been immensely helpful. So Ive just been practicing on my own and Ive run into a problem that I cant quite figure out. I was attempting to write a program that utilizes all of the skills Ive learned in this class. The idea of the program was to have a .txt file with a team city (str) team name (str)  and a team strength (int). I made sure that I aligned all of the data properly and the indexing has worked correctly. So for example after heading the text file looks like this:City1     Team1     10City2     Team2     12City3     Team3     13The file opens correctly and passes over the header correctly. A variable teams is established to be a final list of lists of all the teams in this fictitious league. The wteams variable stores the City Nickname and Strength and accumulates that data into a list. That list is then appended to the teams variable to create a list of lists. The code for this is written below.teamfile = open(teams.txt r)teams = def establishTeams(teamfile):     (file open for reading) -> list of list    Reads the teams file then returns a list of list where index 0 is the team city    index 1 is the team nickname and index 2 is the team strength.    Precondition: teamfile starts with a header that contains no blank lines then a blank    line and then lines containing all of the teams information        # Skip over the teamfile header.    line = teamfile.readline()    while line != :        line = teamfile.readline()    # Read the teams accumulating them into the teams variable.    teams =     line = teamfile.readline()    while line != :        wteams =         teamCity = line[:10].rstrip()        teamNick = line[11:24].rstrip()        teamStr = int(line[25:26].rstrip())        wteams.append(teamCity)        wteams.append(teamNick)        wteams.append(teamStr)        teams.append(wteams)        line = teamfile.readline()            return teams#establishTeams(teamfile)When I run this program and my function in shell everything works great like this:>>> establishTeams(teamfile)[[City1 Team1 10] [City2 Team2 12] [City3 Team3 13]]When I run that same establishTeams(teamfile) code in the program itself it wont return a value. I have done this by simply adding that line of code outside of the function definition. You can see that I have that call commented out at the bottom of this program.It doesnt produce an error when I run this program with the function call inside the program and Ive put in some dummy print statements to see where this is going wrong. It is running through the .txt file lines OK and it is printing the data just fine but it wont access the return statement when the function call is made inside the program.Any ideas as to why I cant get my teams list to return? Thanks for all of your help!-Steve,None,0
