Sunday September 8th 2013 1:44 pm -04:00,Hi EverybodyLike a lot of people Im struggling with step 5.I can get my get_hours function to work with as many seconds I enter as possible and without calling the to_24_hour_clock function.What I dont understand is the purpose of this function as it only gives you hours remaining by dividing by 24.When I do try to use the to_24_hour_clock function with large numbers of seconds I get strange unexpected resultsCan anybody help me make sense of the purpose of calling the to_24_hour_clock p.s. i have read the other threads but they dont really clarify it for me.....maybe its my lack of comprehension :-(, Unresolved,0

Sunday September 8th 2013 2:10 pm -04:00,Hi EtienneMany thanks for the link its satisfying to know that I am on the right track however it would be good to know how to make use of the to_24_hour_clock function hopefully when the assignment is over there will be a an example put up. I do appear to be having rouble with functions - hence im doing this beginners course :-) oh and it was the first time i put up a msg and the view from my screen seem to make it appear i put it in the wrong place - again a learning exercise!!! :-) Once again many thanks for your help.Jan, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 1:44 pm -04:00,HiI felt i had finally completed is_valid_sequence only to find Auto-grader telling me it fails its test however when i run it in the shell all tests pass.my code def is_valid_sequence(DNA_sequence):     (str) -> bool    Return True if and only if the DNA    sequence is valid.    >>> is_valid_sequence(AABCD)    False    >>> is_valid_sequence(AACCGTT)    True    >>> is_valid_sequence(acgt)    False    >>> is_valid_sequence()    False                value = True    for char in DNA_sequence:        if char not in ACGT:           return False    return valueIm unable to see how it fails  Etienne mentions using == instead of in but that just means my testing string would have to absolutely be equal to my ACGT list and in that order. Im really close to giving up as i dont really understand what it is im doing wrong - if anyone can explain in a bit more plain English rather than too much code as ive obviously not grasped what it is im doing wrong or dont really know how to apply what little ive learnt so far.Any help greatly appreciated.Jan, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 2:13 pm -04:00,Hi GuysMy apologies the  >>> is_valid_sequence() does comeback as True -  i had literally just changed the line just before posting - its because i have been pulling my hair out over this problem .The error messages i get are student: test_a2.TestIsValidSequence.test_is_valid_sequence_all_nucleotides    student: test_a2.TestIsValidSequence.test_is_valid_sequence_invalid_capital_letterstudent: test_a2.TestIsValidSequence.test_is_valid_sequence_lowercasestudent: test_a2.TestIsValidSequence.test_is_valid_sequence_zero_lengthmany thanksJan, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 2:41 pm -04:00,Hi JoseIf i delete Value = True  i get the following error message when i run is_valid_sequence() Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#1> line 1 in <module>    is_valid_sequence()  File C:\Python33\a2.py line 88 in is_valid_sequence    return valueNameError: global name value is not definedit seems that i need to include it Jan, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 3:08 pm -04:00,Hi everyoneJust letting you know i am now leaving work and this is the only access i have to the internet i only have the materials that are presented here on the course so any replies i wont be able to respond until 18th Sept. 8am (-4 UTC)Thank you for all that have replied so far.Jan, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 18th 2013 7:01 am -04:00,Hi TomI have just re-submitted the assignment as you suggested and the now the auto-grader has marked the function as correct.Honestly dont know what i had changed or done to do get it correct but i imagine me being so frustrated with re-hashing everything in this code over and over did make me lose track of where i was.just want to say thank you and to everyone else for the help provided - its enough to get me through at least 1 more week :-)Jan, Resolved,0
