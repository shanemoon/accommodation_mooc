I have some sort of programming learning experience but do not have an experience to apply my knowledge to my practical business yet. By taking this course I would like to learn Python through taking this course but also learn way of thinking of programming in English not in Japanese this time and it will make it easy for me to learn about programming and exchange opinion with people all over the world.,None,0
