Thursday September 12th 2013 12:44 pm -04:00,My code isnt wrong so it must be the auto grader.My code does anything ok that i trow at it. Stil I cannot come above 21 out of 24 points due to failures as described above. I cannot reproduce these failures in IDLE or the Python tutor. The failures are supposed to be in get_complement and in get_complementary_sequence. And no I dont use Print statements., Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 5:17 am -04:00,Exactly the same situation here. The same failures and only 21 out of 24. On extensively testing my code i couldnt find any failures. For the same reason I cannot post my code here. As I said before: there must be something wrong with the auto grader.Staff: why dont we here from you on this subject?, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 10:57 am -04:00,For the read_words function my coding ends up with the following words_list:[CRUNCHY COWS EAT GRASS]How do I remove the character before the last three words that shows up as white space? Im really stuck on it. Thank you for your help., Resolved,0

Sunday September 29th 2013 1:43 pm -04:00,I suspect this error comes from this piece of code in the read_words function:open_words_file=open(words_file r)Although the function gives good results it is not accepted by the auto grader.Why isnt it allowed to use this code?, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 2:07 pm -04:00,As the file wordlist1.txt resides on disk with location /Volumes/RAM Disk/wordlist1.txt I have to open it in memory before I can do something with it. So opening it must be done in the function definition.So I dont understand the implication of what you are saying about a file that is already open.When I call my function with:read_words(/Volumes/RAM Disk/wordlist1.txt)it gives the correct result:[CRUNCHY COWS EAT GRASS]Conclusion: although the function acts correctly the auto grader does not accept it for formal reasons that I do not understand. Very frustrating indeed. , Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 2:35 pm -04:00,So no opening and no closing calls in the function definition?, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 3:29 pm -04:00,I stripped the opening and the closing call to the file from my function definition. After that it was accepted by the auto grader.student: test_a3.Test_03_IsValidWord.test_01_return_typeSUCCESSThank you Anonymous (who ever you are) and Vikki Ha for your help., Resolved,0

Sunday September 29th 2013 4:37 pm -04:00,I got the same problem: how does the board have to look like?My board looks like this:[EFJAJCOWSS SDGKSRFDFF ASRJDUSKLK HEANDNDJWA ANSDNCNEOP PMSNFHHEJE JEPQLYNXDL]Is this OK?, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 5:33 pm -04:00,So I got this board_list: a list of 7 string elements.[EFJAJCOWSS SDGKSRFDFF ASRJDUSKLK HEANDNDJWA ANSDNCNEOP PMSNFHHEJE JEPQLYNXDL]board_list[0] returns as expected the string EFJAJCOWSSlist(EFJAJCOWSS) gives [E F J A J C O W S S] thats what I want.To my surprise list(board_list[0])gives the error: TypeError: list object is not callable. Strange as the list object is a string.Now Im stuck on how to transform the board_list so I get what I want.Your suggestions are very much appreciated. , Resolved,0
