Saturday August 24th 2013 9:49 pm -04:00,Im using a Mac running OS X 10.8 with Idle. I save the file and then go back to the shell. I click File > Open Module. A little window pops up to enter the file name and I enter the name. It promptly says file not found even though I have the correct path typed. How do I get it to open the module and execute it?Thanks!, Resolved,0

Friday September 13th 2013 12:10 pm -04:00,I have referred to video 4 of lecture 4 on how to do the accumulator but I keep getting the following error TypeError: NoneType object is not iterableMy indentation is as follows:for ______________:        if char in (ACGT):            complement = complement + char       return complementThe _________ indicates removed code per the honor code but I can only get one iteration before the loop terminates.

Sunday September 15th 2013 1:21 pm -04:00,Ive been doing some of the practice exercises in the wiki. Im not sure how to get started on the week 4 exercise number_of_words. Ive considered counting the whitespace as a means if figuring out the words but that method wont work if there is leading or tailing whitespace. I could also count letters until I hit whitespace but Im not sure how to go about converting the count into a word count.If anyone has any thoughts Id appreciate it.,None,0
