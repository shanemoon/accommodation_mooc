Tuesday September 10th 2013 4:10 pm -04:00,I think I might have been having the same problems initially as you did but then decided to check if there was anything else that might help me solve the problem by doing a dir(str) in IDLE.  If you try that you will see what you are looking for....   I used the one that seemed to fit the bill in my submission and it was accepted as correct.  I hope that this helps without giving away the answer ;-), Resolved,0
