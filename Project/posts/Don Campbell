Tuesday September 10th 2013 7:43 pm -04:00,A for loop in this case goes on letter at a time for what ever is in ss = thisfor char in s:  (the first pass char would == t On the next pass char would == h)    if char in aeionAEIOU: (first pass char == t so the answer = False so it is not added in the next line; second pass not                                           added;   third pass the i is true so it is added)           vowels = vowels  + char  (until the 3rd pass none is add because they were False; on the 3rd pass it would be                                                    vowels ==  + char == i So vowels would be i, Unresolved,0
