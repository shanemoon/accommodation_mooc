Sunday August 25th 2013 9:17 pm -04:00,Hi I had one doubt when trying to use the built-in function id and I will be glad if anyone could explain me.Just to remember the help(id) tells us that:id(...)    id(object) -> integer        Return the identity of an object.  This is guaranteed to be unique among    simultaneously existing objects.  (Hint: its the objects memory address.)It is explained on the video lecture that one value has one memory address and one variable points to the memory address and refers to the value. But I tried one code and for me the variable and the value has the same memory address. Is it wright? (Code bellow)>>> a = 10>>> id(10)505911008>>> id(a)505911008Shouldnt a and 10 have different memory addresses?Thank you for your attention.,None,2
Monday September 23rd 2013 8:20 am -04:00,As I can see there is a lot of people very anxious about the final exam. First of all dont worry guys each coursera course explains with details how the final exam should be submitted how much time do we have to submit it and all the things that we need to know before doing it. I am sure this course will follow this rule.To study for the final exam I wont recommend people to watch all the video lectures again and re-do the assignments and exercises cause that is too exhausting and nobody got time for that. What I recommend is to take a quick look on the notes of the video lectures that we most have doubts because this is fast and can be very helpful. My last recommendation is to practice and understand the structure of the conditionals (Boolean and ifs) and the loops cause they are the most important concepts to start programming. All the built-in functions and methods can be rapidly understood by the help command but the conditionals and loop logic are not., Resolved,7
