Tuesday September 24th 2013 6:34 am -04:00,I have a problem with the readline method on files. I have created this simple program identical to what has been shown on the lecture Reading Files.road = road.txtfile = open(road r)line = file.readline()while line != :    print(line)    line = file.readline()Instead of reading only the first stanza the program prints the whole poem and then runs forever printing empty lines. Where is the mistake here? , Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 6:44 am -04:00,Changing the print line to this:print(line end = )Prevented the infinite loop but did not make the program exit! And it still printed the whole poem not just the first stanza as it was supposed to. Shouldnt the While loop exit after reaching the first newline character?, Resolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 6:56 am -04:00,There are blank lines between the stanzas (the first two are copied below). What is puzzling me is that Ii did exactly as Paul demonstrated in the video but it did not work for me as it worked for him.TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood    And sorry I could not travel both    And be one traveler long I stood    And looked down one as far as I could    To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other as just as fair    And having perhaps the better claim    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;    Though as for that the passing there    Had worn them really about the same, Resolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 8:38 am -04:00,I have completed all the functions and tested them. They are all working and I tested the driver and I could play the game. However when I submitted my code I got a result on 0/11 (Summary: Test results statistics - All=11; Errors=11; Failures=0; Successes=0; Warnings=0. Duration: 0:00:00 [H:M:S].) and not the 37 test I got with my first submission (my score stands at 30?37). Why am I getting this error if I can play the game? And why am I getting 11 tests instead of 37? Is anyone facing the same problem?, Resolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 7:29 pm -04:00,I have solved the problem and maybe my experience can help you. First I had imported the filedialog functions into the code and this caused a problem. Secondly there was the empty string in the board_read function and that cause another error. Once I solved both errors my code was accepted and I got 37/37.The way I solved it was by looking at the error messages I got with each error and search the threads for them. The explanation on other threads was enough to point the problems in my code. Do the same and I am sure you will figure it out., Resolved,0
