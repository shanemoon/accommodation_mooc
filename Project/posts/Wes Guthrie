Sunday August 18th 2013 10:15 pm -04:00,Hello everyone my name is Wes and I am from Muncie IN in the United States. I am taking this online course not only for the certificate of completion but rather for my own understanding of computer programming. I have some experience programming in Visual Basic 2010 as well as C++ but the more complex topics of computer programming have eluded me thus far and this is what I hope to achieve here. What I would like to do is create applications for use on the Android/iOS operating systems and maybe earn a living from it but my ultimate goal is to create an SDK or IDE for use in creating video games on current and older consoles. I wish everyone the best of luck and look forward to speaking with many of you in the hopes of gaining a deeper understanding of programming.,None,4

Basically the individual who programmed the Python language must have made a statement such as if( x ** y) and x = 2 and y = 5 then execute as 2*2*2*2*2, Resolved,1

You can also download the video files from this course as .MP4 files and play them on your smartphone/tablet or watch in VLC but Im not sure if youll get prompted with the questions like so., Resolved,1
