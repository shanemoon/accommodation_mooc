Tuesday October 1st 2013 2:11 pm -04:00,Not sure if this helps but found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1708510/python-list-vs-tuple-when-to-use-eachTuples are faster than lists. If youre defining a constant set of values and all youre ever going to do with it is iterate through it use a tuple instead of a list.It makes your code safer if you “write-protect” data that does not need to be changed. Using a tuple instead of a list is like having an implied assert statement that this data is constant and that special thought (and a specific function) is required to override that.Some tuples can be used as dictionary keys (specifically tuples that contain immutable values like strings numbers and other tuples). Lists can never be used as dictionary keys because lists are not immutable., Resolved,6
