Thursday September 5th 2013 9:18 am -04:00,Etienne can you say why? Im just curious both Introduction to Programming courses my old university offers concentrate on Java. I never took them and kind of regret it now., Pinned Approved Resolved,0
Saturday September 14th 2013 7:31 pm -04:00,Im a complete beginner. My university offered an intro into Java programming course but I went a few times and everything the professor said/did went right over my head so in the end I chose another module. Ive regretted it a little so I wanted to give programming another go.I signed up because I often find that I could do my work better if I could program. I deal with lots of data and while we have all the fancy toys for analysing sometimes Im finding myself stuck with an Excel sheet and a bunch of unsorted data. Im hoping that by learning to program I will be able to write little useful programs for automatically sorting that data sometimes between different documents.I also have been thinking about a project also for work. We have huge amounts of documents personal templates and research papers in our intranet but often people work at the same thing someone else already did simply because they dont know that those documents exist. So Ive been thinking about making some sort of platform where people could update their projects tag them according to the type topic etc. and link that post to the actual document... Pretty sure I wont manage that after this one class but its a start or so I hope. :),None,0

Thursday August 29th 2013 3:52 pm -04:00,I would maybe add that for me writing things down on paper helped especially with choosing the right operator. Just grab an example and try to solve it on paper if you get stuck after that its just the matter of writing it down in IDLE.And I agree dont over-complicate things it all comes down to very basic mathematics., Pinned Resolved,14
Thursday August 29th 2013 3:44 pm -04:00,I have to say Im completely new to programming but so far it seems fairly uncomplicated for me. Especially the assignment seemed really daunting at first sight but the moment I started actually solving things there really wasnt much programming knowledge required (at least nothing we havent learned so far) only basic mathematics and some common sense., Unresolved,3
Thursday August 29th 2013 3:34 pm -04:00,The questions are the same as are the answers from what I can tell. The only issue is that the answers are now in a different order., Resolved,1
Thursday August 29th 2013 3:55 pm -04:00,I did submit the file as stated in the handout I simply uploaded the whole newly-saved a1.py file. After completing the whole assignment I submitted the same file again. , Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 11:26 am -04:00,Thats a good idea it would be interesting to see how others solved the assignment. If its allowed of course., Unresolved,1
Friday September 13th 2013 11:55 am -04:00,For me personally its not really the official keys that I would like to see. What Id like more is the opportunity for other students to post their code to see how others think. I managed to get full points in the first assignment but since Im a complete beginnerI have a feeling that some of my code could be done differently in a more efficient (and elegant) way. You cant really discuss the way you think with a pdf.But of course no posting until (if?) we get the green light. :), Unresolved,1
Friday September 13th 2013 12:26 pm -04:00,I managed to get it right with a set of if and then elif statements one for each nucleotide. Im sure there is a more efficient way to solve this but it works., Resolved,1
Friday September 13th 2013 12:43 pm -04:00,You do have to change it slightly - youre writing a whole string of characters now not just one. But think about what you want your loop to work like: its supposed to go over every character in the sequence and depending on which of the 4 characters it stumbles on add its counterpart to the output string., Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 12:36 pm -04:00,I think Anon is right try different indentation for the return statement (same level as for)., Resolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 1:51 pm -04:00,I would imagine that all code used in such ways would be excessively tested in flight simulators before being approved for actual use. ,None,0
