Monday August 19th 2013 3:37 pm -04:00,to python what happens below the certain line has no effect on that line. At the time that the variable y is created z = 5. Therefore z + 1 = 6. The value 6 is assigned to the variable y and the z+1 no longer matters. Even though the value of z is later changed to 10 ys value is already 6 so the change has no effect., Resolved,7

Its just for you to know that youve tried it so you dont have to go back and do it again. As well since its multiple choice you can answer 3 times per question and you can go back and repeat it as many times as you like there would be no point to showing that you did it correctly., Resolved,0
Friday August 23rd 2013 6:48 pm -04:00,HiWhen writing functions what is the difference between having print and return at the end? I just did one both ways and the only thing I noticed (without experimenting too much) was that it the one with return has   around it when run while the one with print does not. Are there different times when one command should be used over the other? Should I just always use one?,None,1
