Sunday September 1st 2013 12:13 pm -04:00,Folks you need to stop over-thinking questions.  This is a simple introductory course.  If you think the question is a complex riddle that requires a brain teaser answer then youre interpreting the question incorrectly.  Dont look for questions that arent there., Resolved,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 1:31 pm -04:00,Every field has its own terminology.  Part of the answer to your question depends on how deeply you want to get into computer programming.  If youre just taking this course for the fun of it its not critical that you know all of these terms inside and out.  After all you can always look them up on Google.  However if youre thinking of doing more along a computer science or programming line you need to know this stuff.  This is all fundamental programming terminology., Resolved,3
Monday September 9th 2013 8:51 pm -04:00,Is a nucleotide sequence of zero length considered valid?  Im setting my return to False as there are no nucleotides but I think this is causing me to be marked as wrong...Or maybe Im doing something else wrong., Resolved,13
Monday September 9th 2013 10:58 pm -04:00,It doesnt say what the grader expects.  Thats my question.  Return True if and only if the string is valid implies to me anyway that a zero length string should return False i.e.     >>> is_valid_sequence()    FalseIm asking if the above is the expected behavior., Resolved,14

Tuesday September 10th 2013 1:15 pm -04:00,This was helpful.  I didnt realize you could click down another level in the grader app.  Hadnt needed it until now.I would still argue that an empty sequence is invalid but its really not all that important in the grand scheme of things., Resolved,3
Friday September 27th 2013 2:52 pm -04:00,Took me an hour and a half maybe two hours tops.  Everything you need is in the lectures and the last exercise.  If youre stuck go back and re-watch the videos or review the exercise 6 problems., Unresolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 11:15 pm -04:00,Im in IT but management now.  I was a coder longer ago than I care to admit (I used to program in FORTRAN which most people here probably learn about in History of Computing).  I havent written anything beyond an Excel spreadsheet in at least ten years and I thought this course might be a good way to learn a current language.It definitely helps me in doing these assignments but its not any deep mystical secret.  I watch the lectures usually twice I code along with the examples and I make sure I really understand the exercises.  When I get to the assignments I take my time I read and re-read the instructions to make sure I know what theyre looking for I look at examples from the lectures I code a little bit at a time and I test and test and test.  I never move to the next step until Im positive that I have the last step 100% completed.In a funny sort of way its the exact same method that I use when Im doing a woodworking or home improvement project.  Watch lots of YouTube videos read all the instructions make sure I have the right tools then measure twice and cut once., Unresolved,2

Saturday September 28th 2013 11:41 am -04:00,You need to understand what youre doing with each function before you move on to the next.  In this assignment particularly the later functions build on the earlier ones.  Ill echo the comments above that everything you need is in the lectures and in this weeks exercise.  I suggest that when youre watching the lectures you have IDLE open and code along.  Pause the video to give yourself enough time to type in the code if you have to (I know I do).  I dont want this to sound too harsh but if youre spending more than three or four hours on the assignment then you dont understand the material and should go back and watch it again.  Sorry if that sounds mean., Unresolved,2
Sunday September 29th 2013 7:53 pm -04:00,I tested the last two functions in IDLE with the sample files that were provided with the assignment.  Write your functions then run your module so theyre defined.  Open the appropriate sample file by hand then pass the open file as the argument to the function.Dont forget to close the file when youre done., Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 12:38 pm -04:00,I watched it last night and it was really slow to load.  However I just paused it and waited for it to load then started and had no issues.  You may just need to wait longer., Unresolved,0
