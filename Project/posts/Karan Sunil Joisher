Wednesday September 18th 2013 9:01 am -04:00,This course is really great specially for a beginner like me.The kind of assignments and exercises are really challenging and thus going through this course becomes more interesting.I would surely enroll for LTP2 if it is re-offered :) , Resolved,1

Friday September 20th 2013 2:46 am -04:00,The course is about to end and this journey was really amazing.However I want to take up more courses related to programming(and I am a beginner :( ).So can anyone suggest me some courses which is like a continuation to this course(prerequisite for that course is similar to what we have learned in this course).,None,2

Tuesday September 24th 2013 1:00 am -04:00,I have enrolled for a pre-calculus course which is also starting from 7th October.So should I un-enroll from the pre-calculus course as the posts above suggest that An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python is a doable course if you dont take any other courses at the same time.,None,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 6:04 am -04:00,Can someone explain me how this code works...I tried visualizer but I am still not getting how the pairs.append works def make_pairs(list1 list2):     (list of str list of int) -> list of [str int] list        Return a new list in which each item is a 2-item list with the string from the    corresponding position of list1 and the int from the corresponding position of list2.

Friday September 27th 2013 1:43 pm -04:00,Does it mean that whenever a list1 is appended to a list2  and if list1 is modified then same modification would be done in list2? I expected that lists would get appended in the same way as numeric or string values are appended, Unresolved,1
Thursday September 26th 2013 3:19 am -04:00,In the first casepairs.append(inner_list) is outside the loop i.e after the inner_list.append(list2[i]) statement is executed the control would go back to for i in range(len(list1)): until the loop is completed and after the loop gets over the control would go to pairs.append(inner_list)In the second case all statements are under the loop thus as the loop starts it would go up to pairs.append(inner_list) and after that control would go back to for i in range(len(list1)):, Unresolved,1
Friday September 27th 2013 10:36 am -04:00,Even I was confused... and ya even I was finding it difficult to find out the difference between various functions.I suggest you to watch the video again but this time make a note of each function(what the function doeswhen it is used) on a book and then you will be able to understand the difference between these functions.And yes this lecture is VERY important try practicing it in IDLE... because the reading file and writing file concepts both come up in the assignment and I guess thats the only part in assignment where students find difficulty.And not only from the assignment point of view but in order to progress you shouldnt lose hope...watch the video again ...eventually youll understand everything :) , Unresolved,1
