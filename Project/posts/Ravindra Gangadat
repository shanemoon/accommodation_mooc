Thursday September 26th 2013 7:40 am -04:00,This is a great thread.  Since we are nearing the end of the course I would like to learn more about Test Driven Development (TDD).  However when I perform a google search the response is overwhelming.  For a novice that has done well with this course what resource do you recommend that I use next in order to learn more about TDD?  Ive read several articles and they keep on stating write tests first.  But they dont go into the how or the why?Ive spoken to one of our senior programmers at my firm whom has implemented TDD in his teams.  He said it allows them to ship quality code faster.  Also he said writing quality tests can be harder than writing the functional code.  The way that theyve learned TDD was in code reviews and hiring outside professionals to provide testing bootcamps to his team.  Theyve provided this feedback to our local universities in order for them to create more intermediate to advanced courses in this area.,None,0

Thursday September 26th 2013 7:30 am -04:00,Ive taken the Rice course on Coursera and I wished I wouldve taken this course first.  I did well on the Rice course but did not understand how memory worked proper way of designing and writing functions debugging effectively etc....I went and reviewed the code that I wrote in the Rice course for Pong Blackjack etc... and was able to refactor it to make it more elegant and easier to read.This course provides the foundation to do well in the Rice course.  I plan to take the MIT course on EdX next because it covers more topics.  Also the exercises seem to be more challenging ( performed a quick review of the exercises on the MIT site )I wish that the instructors would provide a more test driven approach to development.  Thats what you need in the real world.,None,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 5:04 pm -04:00,In the lecture the professor called the write command twice but opened the file in write mode instead of append modeto_file = open(to_filename w)>>>to_file.write(Copy)5>>>to_file.write(contents)Why didnt he use the a append flag when opening the file?  I thought if you wrote to the file more than once it will overwrite it.  , Resolved,0

Friday September 27th 2013 10:33 pm -04:00,Im reading chapter 7 in the Practical Programming - An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3.  In the first couple of pages ( 119-121 ) the authors introduced the words type and class.  They say that a class is how Python represents a type.  When searching on google I found a definition for a class - its a blueprint.  A class describes how to make something.  Are classes and types the same thing?  For instance you have a boolean class and a boolean type.,None,1
