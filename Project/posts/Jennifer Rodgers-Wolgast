Thursday September 12th 2013 1:13 am -04:00,Tom I get what you are saying and it is helping me understand the find function better but the a.find(hello)+1 part is confusing me.  Does that return 1 because 0+1=1?  Or is there something I am missing?  I dont get why adding 1 is necessary...., Resolved,0
