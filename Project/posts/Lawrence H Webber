Wednesday September 25th 2013 7:03 pm -04:00,Thanks for the assignment. It is a good one to get to grips with.I am having an error that I do not understand when I run a3.py through the submission tool. The same error occurs 7 times and only appears to effect my versions of read_board and read_words.An example:student: test_a3.Test_01_ReadWords.test_02_one_line_filemethod description:noneerror:DisabledBuiltinError Calling the open built-in is not permitted.Yet I know that Im reading both the word file and board file.Example:When I open the shell and run the a3.py module I enter the following:>>> file = board1.txt>>> read_board(file)This yields:[[E F J A J C O W S S] [S D G K S R F D F F] [A S R J D U S K L K] [H E A N D N D J W A] [A N S D N C N E O P] [P M S N F H H E J E] [J E P Q L Y N X D L]]Similarly with file = wordlist1.txt and read_words(file) I get:[CRUNCHY COWS EAT GRASS]Please help me understand where Im going wrong and what this class of error (pun intended) is.Thanks.																, Resolved,0
