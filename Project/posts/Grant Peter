Monday August 19th 2013 6:53 am -04:00,Guys if youre having trouble installing something youll need to include more information if you need help.What OS? Windows / Mac / Linux - Include version / distro / SP etc...     - For Windows click Start right click on My Computer select Properties from the dropdown list and copy the System information    - For Linux open a terminal type: cat /etc/issueand then uname -r    - Im afraid I no nothing about using Mac OSs What steps have you completed? Could you download? What file exactly did you download? Did it run for a bit before stopping?What Error did you encounter? What was the exact text of the error message? Any other information you think might be relevant! Include as much information as possible about what you saw etc... so that people can help you out.,None,1

Tuesday August 20th 2013 6:41 am -04:00,The RUN functions is in the FILE window. This makes sense if you think about it as there may be many files available so just hitting run from the main shell window wouldnt know which one to run but opening the file and then running it is explicitly saying Run this file. It is indeed slightly different to the Apple version but this is down to how the Windows work. In the Apple version the Shell and File windows are Sub-windows within the main IDLE program so the file window was still highlighted before hitting Run. In Windows the the FILE window is opened in a separate window with its own menu etc...@Matteo ALT+P should work on windows instead of the CTRL+P in the video.

Thursday August 22nd 2013 4:32 am -04:00,Short answer: NoLong answer: All languages have their strengths and weaknesses (although there are some that just seem to have weaknesses - unless you consider epeen or obfuscation a strength) but this often boils down to Ease of use vs (Low level) Control. Languages like Python or Perl are pretty easy to pick up and get going as they take care of all the annoying jobs like memorymanagement and type casting. Languages like C or assembler give you much more access to low level processes like toggling registers and storing things in specific places but it is much easier to make more devastating mistakes like overwriting your operatingsystem or crashing the system completely. With so many programming languages available there are many many variations in what is possible. Yes you could reduce all languages down to machine code but I dont think you could necessarily go from a set chunk of machine code back up to any programminglanguage. This is because many languages have some sort of protection written in to them to stop you accidentally destroying your PC for instance.Any comparison of programming languages MUST consider what the end goal is there is not universally best language as the best language for a specific job will differ wildly from job to job.,None,3
Thursday August 22nd 2013 10:14 am -04:00,First off I confess my previous reply seems to be more to a skim read version of your question rather than what you actually wrote so I was more answering the practical rather than theoretical question. I confess I dont fully understand the Turing Completeness stuff and I think I may be arguing some apples with oranges here (and while I really dont know a lot about a lot of different languages) Im an engineer rather than a computer scientist I was under the impression that higher level / interpreted languages obfuscated access to memory etc... to the point that you cant just go in and say set x bit of memory to this value as those things dont exist in the virtual space in which you are working.So if the program you are attempting to create is something like take this piece of data do something to it and produce a result then yes you can do that in any language. BUT if the program needs to act as a bootloader in an embedded environment (ie limited space etc...) then you cant just use anything for that you need something that lets you directly control the hardware.But I suppose it depends if you allow certain cheats that some languages have to get around this like just hardcoding a bunch of machine code in an array and writing that into memory and jumping to the start address.,None,0
Thursday August 22nd 2013 5:32 am -04:00,You may end up never using Python professionally but it is very likely at some point you will need to understand some level of programming. More and more electrical engineering has an electronic component these days and as you need to do more and more complex things you will increasingly need to use computers to control them. Whether the program controlling that function is Python or some other language is down to what systems etc... you will be using but it is very likely that you will benefit from understanding the principles of programming that we are hoping to learn in this course. The syntax etc... may be different but the concepts will very likely be familiar.

Wednesday August 28th 2013 10:54 am -04:00,Function reuse is basically just the idea that once you have defined a function to perform a task it is better to call that function than to rewrite the code contained by the function. There are two reasons for this. Firstly it if you make an error in the original function you can correct it in one place and all instances will be fixed. Secondly you can test the individual functions as a simple function and then build complexity by combining them.So imagine we have a problem that we need to take all the numbers from 1 to 10 then square them and then halve then. We could achieve this by doing:def f(x):	print (1 ** 2 / 2 )	print (2 ** 2 / 2 )	print (3 ** 2 / 2 )	print (4 ** 2 / 2 )	print (5 ** 2 / 2 )	print (6 ** 2 / 2 )	print (7 ** 2 / 2 )	print (8 ** 2 / 2 )	print (9 ** 2 / 2 )	print (10 ** 2 / 2)        returnOR we could define:def square(x):   return x**2def half(x):   return x / 2def f(x):   print (half(square(1)))   print (half(square(2)))   print (half(square(3)))   print (half(square(4)))   print (half(square(5)))   print (half(square(6)))   print (half(square(7)))   print (half(square(8)))   print (half(square(9)))   print (half(square(10)))Now while option two may seem like more work (remember this is a simple example actual functions may be a lot more complicated so you will get a better return) now what if I said to you instead of squaring and halving the values I would like you to cube and quarter the values. In the first example you would have to edit every line of the function being careful not to make any typos. But in the second example a simple change to the square() and half() functions def square(x):   return x**3def half(x):   return x / 4would be all that was necessary - assuming you could live with the poor naming involved :), Resolved,0

Tuesday September 24th 2013 10:12 am -04:00,If you edit the file and REMOVE the final newline char does your function then return the full board? Mine didnt Ive changed it but I still need to wait 50 minutes or so to test it., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 6:10 am -04:00,Type list is mutable.to test this you should create a list variable and pass that to the function. If you are calling it with :update_score([Jonathan 4] ANT)like the example you will have a hard time checking that anything has changed. Instead try:>>> player_info = [Jonathan 4]>>> update_score(player_info ANTS)>>> print(player_info)I used ANTS rather than ANT because words less than 4 letters dont score anything., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 5:49 am -04:00,True or False? (This one only is clear !)>>> is_valid_word([ANT BOX SOB TO] TO)TrueYes this should be TRUETrue or False? T is in TO or in ANT...  >>> is_valid_word([ANT BOX SOB TO] T)This should return FALSE. Think of it as having a Match Whole Word option.True or False? Look false but TO is in TOP  >>> is_valid_word([ANT BOX SOB TO] TOP)This should return FALSE. TOP is not in the list. It doesnt matter that TO is in TOP you shouldnt be matching that way around., Resolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 5:51 am -04:00,Just because a word is on the board does not make it a Valid word hence the need for is_valid_word() list. Otherwise we would only need board_contains_word() and you could score with words like ANTT or XSOB.EDIT: Ideally the wordslist should be a complete dictionary for the sake of game play but since we are limited it is conceivable that there are actual words on the board that are NOT valid words as they got left off the wordlist., Resolved,1
Wednesday September 25th 2013 6:25 am -04:00,    pairs =     inner_list =    Initialise the list variables    for i in range(len(list1)):for each item in list list1:       inner_list.append(list1[i])       inner_list.append(list2[i])add the corresponding item at offset i from list list1 and list2 to the list inner_list       pairs.append(inner_list)Add the list inner_list to the list pairs.   return pairsreturn the pairs.Cant really comment on it more without giving away the answer completely., Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 6:15 am -04:00,I am trying one of the options in both idle and the visualiser but they produce a different result. Why would this be? How do I know which is correct?I have a problem with trying to get the return code to work in python but the id in question is still set to false when the program terminates and it should be true if the code is correct.It shouldnt be different but remember the visualizer stops when it returns the final value so you might miss it.Why is the return found producing an  indent error or a return ouside function error?You have to be VERY careful with your indents in python as they link chunks of code together rather than having braces {} or end of loop tokens (endif) that are used by other languages. So everything in an if statement must have the same indent or it will think you want the next bit to happen after the conditional is finished. Be especially careful when copying and pasting code as this will sometimes add or remove indents depending on the editor / program you are using., Unresolved,0
