Tuesday September 10th 2013 12:07 am -04:00,Hi everyoneJust to add to the discussion... I putÂ s1.find(s2 s1.find(s2)+s1.find(s2))which seems to work fine in Python but I also got it wrong. Did not bother to try any variations... Maybe someone can tell why my expression is wrong.Thanks!, Resolved,-1
