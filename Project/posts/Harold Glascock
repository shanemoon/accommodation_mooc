Tuesday September 10th 2013 2:44 am -04:00,Another useful site to find out the urls  for the best free courses is http://www.coursetalk.org/  bearing in mind that taking these courses is not completely free in the sense that we have to allocate x hours of time to complete each course. To make better course taking decisions it would be helpful to have the total video minutes for every course stated upfront in hours and minutes format. There should also be an estimate of how long it takes to complete each assignment. I understand that everyone is different so in reality more time than the minimum is often required. Anyway knowing that the course reputation is good with other takers is a worthwhile indication that taking a course would be time well spent. ,None,0

Tuesday September 10th 2013 2:54 am -04:00,I would like to know how you are planning to scaffold your programming knowledge exactly? For example is it better to learn programming languages in x sequence if one wants to be a game programmer or y sequence for web developer? What are the optimal constellations of programming languages　for gaming business finance web development? Are there any relevant forums to debate this?  Im very interested in alt coins and cryptography ....someone is talking about using meteor but I want to be able to understand how to read Python and how to know when Python programming is the best solution for a spectrum of coding problems. ,None,1
