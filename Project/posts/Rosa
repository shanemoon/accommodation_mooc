Friday September 6th 2013 8:05 pm -04:00,As I understand my error is basically related with the time to spend to have a result. Is it correct?Ive tried to simplify the function but the result is always the same... I continuous to reformulate the functions to reduce the time if it is the caused of my failure., Resolved,0
