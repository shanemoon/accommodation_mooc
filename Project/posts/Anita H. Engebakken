Tuesday August 20th 2013 5:44 am -04:00,figured it out I need to leave a space between the indent and the return expression. Then it worked fine :), Resolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 4:47 am -04:00,mine looks like this:def area(base height):        (number number) -> number        Return the area of a triangle with dimensions base        and height                	return base * height / 2and I still get the same error message: inconsistent use of tab and spaces in indentationIt marks the area after the return statementIve tried having just the 1st line of the doc string Ive tried having no line shifts in the doc string and between the doc string and return statement but I still get the same error., Unresolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:29 am -04:00,Problem is that it doesnt solve the problem. Ive tried!multiple times.it doesnt help if it looks like this:def area(base height):        (number number) -> number        Return the area of a triangle with dimensions base and height.            return base * height / 2 or  this:def area(base height):        (number number) -> number    return base * height / 2or a variety of other things Ive tried.If I remove all the doc string it works again.Im puzzled, Unresolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 6:41 am -04:00,I ended up writing the entire def from scratch in a new file. Then it worked. But still puzzled as to what went wrong...., Unresolved,0
Tuesday August 27th 2013 5:20 pm -04:00,Unfortunatly thats not correct. Ive used only one tab. It still LOOKS the same to me but now it works. and I hadnt c/p either the first time around.there had to have been some mistake in there but Im still unable to locate it. Having tried after making the code work when I wrote everything in from scratch and stored it under another file name.  it now looks like this and this one works:def area(base height):        (number number) -> number        Return area of triangle with dimensions base and height.                return base * height / 2, Unresolved,0
