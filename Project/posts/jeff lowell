Monday September 16th 2013 2:35 am -04:00,Read through the FAQ and nothing jumped out.def contains_sequence(dna1 dna2):     (str str) -> bool    Return True if and only if DNA sequence dna2 occurs in the DNA sequence    dna1.    >>> contains_sequence(ATCGGC GG)    True    >>> contains_sequence(ATCGGC GT)    False    >>> contains_sequence(ATCGGC AT)    True        [Code removed]Thank you for taking a look, Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 2:52 am -04:00,Thank you Ettienne.  I had actually verified results via the command line.  needed a print to see the error of my ways :)figured it out.@ ashwini - This step does explicitly say For these functions you may use built-in functions str operations (for example: in + indexing) and str methods.  Granted it can be done without but when given the option... :), Resolved,0
