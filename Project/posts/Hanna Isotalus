Monday September 2nd 2013 6:02 pm -04:00,Sorry if I am reposting or posting under the wrong topic. My problem is that I am on holiday and I cannot get the computer I have access to to run Python. For this reason I cannot manage to do assignment 1 by the 11th of September which is the hard deadline. If I do not submit this assignment on time does this mean I will be refused credit for the whole course or just for this one assignment?Thank you in advance for clarifying this for me or pointing me toward the direction of the answer. I tried to browse the site but this still remained unclear for me. Best wishes , Unresolved,0
