Thursday October 3rd 2013 5:15 am -04:00,Hi !  Thanks for your post. Im having a little bit of trouble with this also.I do have my code running  but it returns 2 instead of 3 with the example given in the docstring.I tried to run my code in the Visualizer but I cant get the Visualizer to work. I put  my code in and Visualizer says  global variable board_contains_word not defined. Im not sure how to enter my code into Visualizer as Ive only been using IDLE to check my work but Id like to use Visualizer to look at my code step by step since I dont understand why it is returning 2 instead of 3. I think its stopping before the end of the list words ?Thanks !, Unresolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 6:12 am -04:00,Oh  just saw this post and I guess you saw there was a problem with one of my other functions instead Lol. Thanks for the reply any how (:, Unresolved,0
Thursday October 3rd 2013 6:02 am -04:00,Well looks like my code for num_words_on_board is working correctly but there is a problem with my board_contains_word_in_column function. num_words_on_board is not recognizing TO as a word which is giving me the return of 2 instead of the correct return of 3.I broke down my code and ran seperate tests for each word in the example again in IDLE to figure out what was wrong. Still I would like to know how to enter code correctly in visualizer if anyone can let me know. Im not sure how to run the code & call the function correctly in Visualizer. Thanks., Unresolved,0

Thursday October 3rd 2013 6:20 am -04:00,This is great ! Thanks Tom. And for those still having a problem and you think your code is not working....it may actually be that another function is not working correctly (As Tom had mentioned previously in above posts)Check again :board_contains_word_in_columnboard_contains_word_in_row, Unresolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 12:53 pm -04:00,Ive been doing good until now but I really have no idea where to start on this function read_words and am having trouble understanding how to use open() and .readline() .This is what I think I understand - there is already an open file given to us either called wordslist1.txt or words_file  and we are supposed to return a list of words from this file.any time I try to call the function read_words(words_file) in IDLE it cant get past line 1 and says words_file is not definedI have tried to put various code in the body of the function for example words_file= open(wordslist1.txt r)I also tried calling read_words(wordslist1.txt) in IDLE .As you can see I am very lost. I cant even begin to write code until I understand how to just open and read a file in IDLE ! The lecture video made it look easy...I tried making my own file a couple of days ago and tried opening it and reading it and I thought I understood. ;(  Maybe I will try that again..., Unresolved,1

Saturday October 5th 2013 7:47 am -04:00,Hamish I got it !! Thank you so much for taking the time to write out an explanation. :), Unresolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 7:46 am -04:00,UnaI needed to learn how to open & read a file to understand how my code was going to work. Also so that I could see what was in a file. You will use open() and .read() in IDLE  NOT in the code in the body of your function read_words(words_file).The only thing that should be in the body of your function is the code you write to return a list made of the words in the file wordlist1.txt .So in the end  1. You will call your function read_words() in IDLE 2. IDLE will run your code that you wrote in the body of the  read_words(words_file) function3. and a list of words will be returned., Unresolved,1

Saturday October 5th 2013 8:44 am -04:00,IDLE can not locate your filesThe first thing you need to do is:Find where your files are located (the file path) and then point the IDLE shell to the directory (file path) that wordlist1.txt  is in.Putting all your files in one folder and naming it Assignment3 will help keep you organized (as suggested by Hamish).In Hamishs example he used this:>>>import os>>> os.chdir(C:\\Projects\\Learning To Program\\Assignments\\Assignment3)The file path where your stored your files will probably be different. For example this was mine :>>>import os>>> os.chdir(C:\Python33\Assignment3) You can also point the IDLE shell to  a file path by assigning it a variable (<----this is what Paul showed us in the video lecture)For example:file = C:\ Python33\Assignment3\wordlist1.txt After IDLE knows where to find the file you want it to retrieve then you can open and read the file.I hope this helps ! :), Unresolved,0
