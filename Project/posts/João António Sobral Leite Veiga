Tuesday September 24th 2013 2:36 pm -04:00,Please dont forget that the function receives as argument a list!!!This is how you test it:>>> testlist = [a 2 c d] # Just an example. Notice that you can include whatever elements because its a List!!!>>> shift_right(testlist)>>> testlist[d a 2 c]And NOT with testlist = [a b c d]. Notice the quotes., Resolved,2
Wednesday September 25th 2013 7:31 pm -04:00,Thats because python passes by reference. (You can see that on the visualizer)1. Notice that shift_right does not return anything. So it wont have anything to print. If you want to call a print you have to add return L at the end or just print(L) anyway.2. When youre calling shift_rt([A B]) you are not storing the list anywhere. So when the function ends you dont have any reference to it and thus you cant print or see what happened.-> Do this instead:L = [A B ...]shift_rt(L)And then check what happened to L ;-), Resolved,0
