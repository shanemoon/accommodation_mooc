Thursday August 29th 2013 5:39 pm -04:00,I tried the first exercise twice and found that in addition to re-ordering the answers the questions may be different.   It is on the same topic but might be a different example.   The possible answers remained the same but they changed the question to match a new answer.   I printed out my feedback from the first attempt so it wasnt too time consuming to redo the exercise but you do have to reread them all and think about the answer a bit.   If you got it the first time it shouldnt be too tough the second time around., Resolved,0
