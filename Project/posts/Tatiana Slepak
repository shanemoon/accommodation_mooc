Sunday September 15th 2013 3:43 pm -04:00,Here is my code for the function get_complementary_sequence    nucleotide =     for char in dna:       nucleotide = nucleotide + char    return get_complement(nucleotide)when I run it on IDLE it only converts the first letter in any of my examples and doesnt go any further. Ive got the same problem in Exercise 4 in question 14 when I tried every answer one by one in my IDLE none worked correctly. Two of them gave me just the first letter in a strDo I have a problem with my IDLE program or my code is incorrect?, Resolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 9:40 pm -04:00,HelloI seem to solve the problem make_str_from_column(board column_index)When I check it in IDLE it gives me the right answer.But now I wanted to use this function in board_contains_word_in_column(board word)and I cant seems to work it right - it gives me False all the time or some Error messages. When I copy/paste the code into Python visualizer it only shows one step started from Def so I cant see whats wrong and were the code is stuck. My head doesnt work anymore and it seems that I forgot everything what Ive learned here. Any suggestions or hints?Dont even know what I can post here so not to violate an honor code, Resolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 8:52 am -04:00,Kimberly how you enter the code into visualizer? I was trying copy/paste it from the .py file and it would show only one step right at the beginning (def ...). When I deleted the beginning it gave me errors about indentation that I was unable to fix. I knew it would help if I see what the code is doing but I dont know how to place it in vizualizer, Resolved,0
