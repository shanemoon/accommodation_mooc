Monday September 30th 2013 2:39 am -04:00,I am having trouble with this too. My file is stored in C:\Python\wordlist1.txtI think my issue is with using the back slash character but I cant work out how to fix it. It doesnt seem to like the colon character either! >>> open(C:\Python\wordlist1.txt r)Traceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#32> line 1 in <module>    open(C\Python Scripts\wordlist1.txt r)FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: C\\Python Scripts\\wordlist1.txtIve also got a copy in the same folder as the Python program so should be able to do this:>>> open(wordlist1.txt r)<_io.TextIOWrapper name=wordlist1.txt mode=r encoding=cp1252>Arrrrrrrrhhhhh!!!!! Its like the time when I spent two days working out how to go back to the last command so I didnt have to keep typing the same thing. Alt P... who knew? Easy when you know how. Not so easy when you dont!, Unresolved,0

Monday September 30th 2013 3:24 am -04:00,That was me trying to use different variations on where I had the file. Sorry... being confusing. So this does indeed work:aFile = open(wordlist1.txt r)>>> aFile.readline()CRUNCHYThanks! And now this works too for when the file is in a different folder:>>> aFile = open(C:/Python Scripts/wordlist1.txt r)>>> aFile.readline()CRUNCHY>>> I had the slashes round the wrong way! I dont think they explained this in the lectures as they were using Macs. Thank you both for your help!! It really is the easiest stuff I seem to get stuck on and they googling gets me more confused. , Unresolved,0
