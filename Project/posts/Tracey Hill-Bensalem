Wednesday September 11th 2013 10:46 pm -04:00,Im getting this failure:student: test_a2.TestContainsSequence.test_contains_sequence_at_beginningAm uncertain which function is the one I need to review. All of my example calls return the proper results and that is the only error/fail that I have.I find the automatic check the course provides brilliant :) ... but if it could be clearer re: which function is in error (and where) it might be even more helpful.Can anyone clarify?, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:09 pm -04:00,I will recheck that function but I guess to be sure Id have to submit a version with just that function and then resubmit with the full file... with the possible 1h delay for each submit looks like I wont finish tonite! grrrr (but thanks Tom!), Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 11:26 pm -04:00,Aha...yes. All of my test cases (which were successful) had the sequence in the center not in the beginning of the first dna sequence. That should teach me to vary my test cases.Duh. I didnt realize the beginning was referring to the beginning of my sequence not my function. Now I need to figure out how to fix it.I used a .find / true test., Resolved,0
Monday September 16th 2013 6:07 pm -04:00,I too recommend (very highly) the interactive python course. In fact I recommend both courses and that you stick with this one...Actually I started this course some time ago and after a couple of lectures sort of gave up then took the other class. It was fabulous! Building games and having a great deal of fun while learning. The professors were incredible.That said now Im back here and getting so much out of this class really understanding now some of the things that I did in the other but didnt fully grasp. The two courses are actually very complementary... Id recommend both!,None,0
