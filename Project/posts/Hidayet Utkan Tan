Monday August 19th 2013 3:47 am -04:00,Hello I have found this forum thread while searching for help. It may be useful. http://wiki.python.org/moin/Asking%20for%20Help/Why%20does%20IDLE%20refuse%20to%20start%20on%20Windows%3FAsking for Help: Why does IDLE refuse to start on Windows?Bonjourafter a long time without Python I loaded Python 262. IDLE is refusing to start claiming there is a personnal firewall Protection hindering subprocesses. Im on Win XP. What should I do?Thanks on forwardThis is a rather irksome issue caused by the way personal firewall software works on Windows as compared to other platforms (Linux Mac OS X ...). I wont bore you with the technical details of this problem but Im not familiar with the way you have    things set up so I will break this into five cases:            You have personal firewall software (ZoneAlarm BlackICE Defender ...) installed. This can be handled simply by telling your personal firewall package not to block IDLE from connecting to its subprocess. Also make sure you dont have Windows            Firewall turned on too; if you have it on in this case turn it off.        You are relying on Windows Firewall. Youll have to go into Control Panel and tell Windows Firewall not to block IDLE from connecting to its subprocess.    You are behind a home router of some sort (an external box that takes your Internet connection and sort of splits it up allowing multiple computers to use it or providing you with a wireless connection). If so turn OFF Windows Firewall and uninstall        any personal firewall software you may have in addition to the router. All home routers act as firewalls.    Somebody else set your PC up and you have no clue what is going on. If so ask them for help.    This is happening with something besides a home PC. If so talk to whoever runs the IT department there and ask them for help., Resolved,0

Tuesday August 20th 2013 1:51 pm -04:00,Hi  you can not move up to the code you have written and edit or delete it if you have already pressed enter.you can use alt+p or alt+n (I assume p is for previous and n is for next) and bring the same code back on a new line and do the editing or deleting before pressing enter. I hope this helps. (these alt+ commands are for windows for mac they are different), Resolved,1
