Tuesday September 10th 2013 1:28 pm -04:00,Hello.Ive started the new Assignment this afternoon and I came across a doubt.The first ones are easy had no problem doing it. However when I tested its_valid_sequence things get a little bit more complicated.I was able to solve the puzzle but i know that my solution is a complicated one and that must be a more simple one. By other words ive counted all A T C and G sum them all and then compare the lenght of the sum with the query sequence. After testing several examples I know it works.So my question is: I now that this is a long way around but if i submit it will it be considered right? Or must I go through the shortest (and more logic) way?, Resolved,0

Saturday October 5th 2013 11:24 am -04:00,Hello.First of all the course was overwelming! It is very well structurated its easy to learn and all classes are perfectly explained in detail.However I would suggest that you could detail a liitle bit more on opening and writing to files. This is my personal point of view because I work with a lot of information contained in txt files. Also some may have the need for that file to run from the command line and not the IDLE.I know I know... the rest of the work must be done by me and that this is only an Introduction to Python. But in the reading and writing files chapter some things that I consider essential are missing to sucessfully cover all my needs.Again this is my personal point of view and only in these issues. All the rest is almost flawlessly perfect! This is true because I could write a small script based on the couse content :-) and it fells GREAT!Congratulations to all of you for the work and time spented in putting this course together.All the bestRicardo, Pinned Approved,1
Saturday October 5th 2013 11:15 am -04:00,Hello.Ive never programmed before but I always wanted to learn it.As a PhD Student in Computational Chemistry I was hoping that tkaking this course online would help me in writing some python scripts that could process the amount of data that I get from my work.And... I finally did it.I was able to write a small python script to calculate the number of ligand-protein interactions between two halves of a transporter protein giving the results instantaneously. Briefly:- opens a ligand-protein contact file:- sums all contacts in one side- sums all contacts in the other half- divides one by another giving this information (decimal and percentage) in terminal but also writing it into a file.And with a little bit of investigation I could make it running directly from the terminal as:python process_cic.py file.txtJust for this this course was worth it. But sincerely I LOVED IT!Ill be waiting for the next.Many thanks to the instructors and the community once again!!!PS: Here is my code:import sysimport math(file)->strOpen an LIGPLOT interaction profile between ligand and residues and return the processed data regarding ligand-protein contacts in Unit 1 ligand-protein contacts Unit 2 and the ratio between them.>>> process_cic(file)epoxycarbamoylboetirane_CUnit 1 - 19Unit 2 - 20CIC - 0.95 (95%)# define the two unitsunit1 = unit2 = # define the file and index all the lines in the fileraw = open(sys.argv[-1] r)raw_lines = raw.readlines()    # identify the molecule from the first line of the filemol_name = raw_lines[0][:-1]# define a list of accepted residues for each unitres_unit1 = [TYR  271THR  297PHE  300PHE  303ILE  304PHE  692SER  693PHE  696SER  697]res_unit2 = [PHE   39THR   43MET  913TYR  917LEU  939PHE  942VAL  946MET  950]# check line by line if residues belong to unit 1 or unitfor i in range(5len(raw_lines)):    if raw_lines[i][28:36] in res_unit1:        unit1.append(int(raw_lines[i][67]))    else:        unit2.append(int(raw_lines[i][67]))# sum all the resultssum1 = sum(unit1)sum2 = sum(unit2)            # present the resultsprint(mol_name)print(Unit 1 -  sum1)print(Unit 2 -  sum2)print(CIC - (sum1 / sum2)  ( (sum1 / sum2 * 100) % ))# append to a filefile = open(processed_cic.txt w)file.write(mol_name + )file.write(Unit 1 -  + str(sum1) + )file.write(Unit 2 -  + str(sum2) + )file.write(CIC -  + str(sum1 / sum2) +  ( + str(sum1 / sum2 * 100) + %) + ),None,2
