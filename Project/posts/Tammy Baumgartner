Monday September 2nd 2013 4:47 pm -04:00,I started working on my code about three hours ago.  I completed the seconds_difference function and submitted my file to see if I was doing it correctly.  My score summary was:  Test results statistics - All=42; Errors=30; Failures=5; Successes=7; Warnings=0. Duration: 0:00:00.114629 [H:M:S]. I went back to complete the assignment.  I tried submitting again and received this message:  Test results statistics - All=8;Errors=8; Failures=0; Successes=0; Warnings=0. Duration: 0:00:00 [H:M:S].All now shows 8 rather than 42.  Am I looking at this all wrong or is the system down?  , Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 6:14 pm -04:00,Thank you.  I tried again with just the first two functions completed and all looks good.  Do I need to wait one hour before submitting again? , Resolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 8:17 am -04:00,Confused about the multiplication. If score = 0 how does score = score * 1 when anything multiplied by 0 is 0?, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 29th 2013 9:11 pm -04:00,When I checked just the tiny word score (if score <3 return 0) my answer was successful.  However when I added elif statements for the additional lengths I received a 11 errors 0 passes 0 fails in the auto grader.  Not sure what Im doing wrong and what happened to my previous score. , Resolved,0
