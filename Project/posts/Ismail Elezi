Anyway the solution is very simple.I recommend to everyone to read the question explanation after you submit the homework. If you have submitted a wrong answer the explanation explains how the solution should come and then in the next try it becomes way more easier. , Resolved,0
Saturday October 5th 2013 10:03 am -04:00,Okay first of all I want to thank Jennifer and Paul for the great work they have done. Just finished the exam and I think that I have leant a lot of things about Python.Anyway what is people opinions on having both exercises and assignments? Personally I didnt like exercises that much most of them you could finish with only copy-pasting the code on IDLE or just making a review of lectures. On the other side the assignments were great. I think that the majority of things I have learnt came from assignments. In order to complete them you had to understand the lectures think about what is required try the code in different ways fix the errors retry etc. I really felt great when I finished the assignments and got the maximum score. That was the time when I thought that yeah I am really learning something.Not trying to look smart or anything but what are people opinions on having only weekly assignments (and no exercises). In one other coursera course I am taking (Game programming with C# and XNA) this seems to be the case and to be fair I am liking that evaluation more. You really have to do a lot of more things in order to make an assignment than to finish a weekly exercise (and so you learn more). Just my suggestion of course but if also other students feel that they have learnt much more from assignments than from exercises wouldnt be bad to change the evaluation model for future courses.,None,0
