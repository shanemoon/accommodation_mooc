Wednesday September 4th 2013 12:15 pm -04:00,Im having trouble getting all the correct results of the given examples with this code for part six.  I tried variations of this code and still cant get the correct answers to all the examples.  I think I dont understand the concept of UTC so the code is not making sense and Im now guessing.  Any help?  Thanks Rosereturn (utc_offset - time) % 24, Resolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 12:30 pm -04:00,Thank you Peter.  I tried reversing the my return and it works.  Thank you so much.  Its apparent to me I was having a little trouble with the concept.  Crystal clear now.  Thank you again., Resolved,0
Wednesday September 4th 2013 12:40 pm -04:00,now how would I change the %24 to using the function to_24_hour_clock?  I used a function as part of my return in step two but now I seem to have gone brain dead.  Thank you., Resolved,0
Thursday September 5th 2013 2:42 am -04:00,YannIck thank you for your suggestion.  With one small change to your suggested code I was able pass the to_24_hour_clock function in the return statement.  Thank you again.  I have a much better understanding., Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 11:43 am -04:00,Well Adrian I disagree with you on your interpretation of the Honor Code.  Yannick used my incorrect code as an example which Ive seen over and over and other TAs have entered in the discussion giving explicit answers also.  Just a thought..., Resolved,0
Saturday September 7th 2013 8:05 pm -04:00,Is the global frame the same as the main frame?  My first thought was no they are different but my first attempt at answering this set of questions was one number too many. Because the question states: Including the main frame how many... I added an additional frame and was of course incorrect.Thanks for any clarification., Unresolved,1

Thursday September 12th 2013 1:40 am -04:00,Can this be written as a one line return statement or does it involve if else statements?  If it can be written as a one line return statement can someone point me in the right direction.  Ive looked up find count and index and now Im struggling.Thanks, Unresolved,0
