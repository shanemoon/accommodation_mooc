Thursday August 22nd 2013 9:49 am -04:00,On the Quiz in Course 1 of Fundamentals the question is asked What is the number of arguments that round can take but while working with round I got an error that said round() takes at most 2 arguments the second argument being the limiter for the number of decimal points. Can someone explain the discrepancy between these 2 statements?  , Resolved,0
Thursday August 22nd 2013 12:33 pm -04:00,That does not help me at all. I read the help. I am asking why the answer to the quiz does not match the error response., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 2:06 pm -04:00,I am running Python on Windows Vista but I do not have a menu bar att the top of my shell as the one in the video shows so I can not access the run or other menu commands. Do I have to install this on a Mac to have those functions?, Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 2:22 pm -04:00,Yes all I have is a command line shell(black). There is no Menu to select File from., Resolved,0
Tuesday August 20th 2013 2:44 pm -04:00,OK thanks. I had gone to the Python folder and double clicked the executable file which brought up the command shell. I never saw the Idle executable in the Python folder but I have now found it in the start menu folder. I have no idea where the corresponding executable is but at least I do have Idle  running at this point. Thanks again., Resolved,0
Thursday August 22nd 2013 12:40 pm -04:00,On the Quiz in Course 1 of Fundamentals the question is asked What is the number of arguments that round can take and the correct answer is 1. While working with round I got an error that said round() takes at most 2 arguments. Although I do understand that the argument can be an equation I have not found an example of someone using 2 arguments. Can someone explain the discrepancy between the quiz answer and the error statement?  , Resolved,1
Saturday September 14th 2013 9:47 pm -04:00,I am not looking for the answer to this I just wanted someone to tell me why the first method I tried did not work. I do know that we are supposed to used arithmetic operators but I thought the following expression(s) would identify the value of the 2nd occurrence of s2. I thought I could assign the value of the 1st occurrence (ind1) and then use that value  to find the 2nd occurrence. The 2nd(half) of the expression returns the same value as the 1st and ignores the value of ind1.ind1 = s1.find(s2)s1.find(s2 ind1)ThanksScott Morgan, Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 11:39 am -04:00,Thank you everyone for the response I realize it needed to be a single line I just broke it up for the purpose of outlining my dilemma as I was explaining it. My problem was that I did not realize that why the value kept going back to the 1st index. Why I do not know. DOH of course if you start at the same point you are going to get the same result. I was under the assumption it would move to the next index point. Once this error in my thinking was pointed out I was able to quickly resolve the expression. Thanks to Nick and Tom.Scott, Resolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 9:17 pm -04:00,Can someone tell me how this is wrong I tried this code in idle and it returned the values that the question required.(ind1) = (s1.find(s2)); (s1.find(s2 (ind1 + 1)))I worked on this one question for 3 days and was sure it was working., Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 10:01 pm -04:00,I see what you are saying and I get it now.So you are saying that my expression was actually 2 expressions because I used a ;?It does work the way I wrote it and I did use the parameters that were defined. I did not see anything that disqualified use of a ; So no partial credit for that???/, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 10:02 pm -04:00,What did not work? Toms suggestion got me to the right place. My code worked but I guess it was considered 2 separate expressions because I used a semi colon., Unresolved,0
