Friday September 6th 2013 6:34 am -04:00,I guess you should have your module.py in the same folder that python is i.e. it should be in your Applications folder. Most programs will look for a file in the same folder where the program itself is running (same address). I believe that is a way of running python from the terminal and specifying the module address so it will look for it in another folder (e.g. your Documents folder) but I dont know how to do it as well...  :(, Pinned Approved Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 7:10 am -04:00,HiIm pretty new to  programming so maybe these will be really basic question. 1) If I start python in Terminal by typing python is there any way to use a module.py that is in another folder (i.e. not in the same folder where python is)? I tried ~/Documents$ module.py but it does not seem to work.2) When that is accomplished is that a way of running functions from module.py? What I mean would be something similar to running a script in [R] and pressing CMD+RETURN from the script. I guess my question is if its possible to call a function from outside Terminal (or for example if using IDLE from the module and not from the IDLE shell).Thank you in advance!, Unresolved,0
