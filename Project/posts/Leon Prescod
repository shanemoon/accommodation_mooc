Wednesday September 11th 2013 7:46 am -04:00,I have the same problem.  If you run the module then press Alt+Tab that will hopefully highlight the current line (the first line). Then you need to use Alt+Tab every time after pressing the Step button to return the focus to the module and highlight the current line.  Not ideal but it works for me. Hope it helps. , Resolved,4
Tuesday September 17th 2013 4:05 pm -04:00,Want to be certain Im understanding this commenting thing.  Can anyone tell me if the comments in my get_complementary_sequence file below make sense.  Im not sure if the comment on comp is right because at the point at which the comment is made comp actually contains nothing.def get_complementary_sequence(dna):    (str) -> str    Return the DNA sequence complementary to the given sequence dna.    >>> get_complementary_sequence(TT)    AA    >>> get_complementary_sequence(GACT)    CTGA    >>> get_complementary_sequence(GGCATTCAGA)    CCGTAAGTCT        # comp contains the nucleotide complements to dna.    comp =     # accumulate the nucleotide complements to dna.    for char in dna:        (etc etc)    return comp, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 17th 2013 4:43 pm -04:00,Thanks for the reply.  I guess youre right that Im getting hung up on the details too much.  As for my overly long code my 11-year-old son pointed out exactly the same thing this evening.  Hes doing the course with me and its beginning to get a little embarrassing.  These digital natives seem to just get it effortlessly!  Thanks again., Unresolved,1

Thursday October 3rd 2013 3:36 pm -04:00,Thanks Nick.  The problem turned out to be that Id saved my a3 file as a3_leon but the driver was importing just a3.  Schoolboy error!  Then again I am in school here., Resolved,0
