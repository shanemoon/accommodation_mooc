Saturday August 24th 2013 1:59 pm -04:00,Hi Sajjad;I am an Electronic Engineer - doing hard core circuit design (photon counting devices lasers solar / wind switching power supplies and the like).If you do Engineering rather than paperwork you will definitely need some (any) programming language to solve various quick and dirty real life problems. - usually those that are a bit more than a simple calculator can handle.I use several different languages from assemblers to C++ but am finding that Python is the all around best language to use as a I need it quick problem solver.In sort it should become part of your engineering toolbox just like a calculator and a DVM.Good luck., Resolved,1

Saturday August 24th 2013 2:30 pm -04:00,Take An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python from Rice University (here on Coursera) if you want a fun intro to game programming in Python.  You will find yourself staying up nights writing code playing and enhancing the game you just wrote playing your fellow classmates games and the like.I just finished it and had a *blast*.  I am an Electronic Engineer and took it just for fun and really enjoyed it. (Learned a lot as well)Good luck.,None,2
