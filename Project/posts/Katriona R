Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:33 am -04:00,Hi Im confused about the first part of Assignment 1. I copied and pasted the seconds_difference from the A!.py  added the  line for the body of the code and tested it this worked fine. Then I was confused about how to submit so I saved it as Wk2Assignment1.py and submitted it. But the View showed me Failed all and I have 8 errors.   If it worked ok as a function call why is it an error?Now I dont know what to do or if I should try proceeding., Resolved,0
