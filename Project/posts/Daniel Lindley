Monday August 19th 2013 12:03 am -04:00,The problem summary:Chrome version used: Version 28.0.1500.95 m (latest)Steps to reproduce:Trying to watch any Week 1 Video Lecture by clicking their title and/or icon.The player UI opens but no video is displayed. The time remains at 0:00/0:00 and does not attempt to load anything further.This occurs in both the HTML5 and Flash versions of the player. Changing my settings before I launch the video or trying to change them when the video fails to load does not correct the issue.Attempting to view the course videos within Firefox (latest) does not solve the issue.Screenshot:HTML5 (Chrome)Flash (Chrome)FirefoxEdit: I can now view the video in HTML5. Unfortunately I have done a number of things since this post was made so I cannot say with certainty which step fixed the issue. Some of the steps I have taken are: cleared my internet cache temp files and restarted my computer. There is the possibility that none of that affected the outcome and it may have been fixed by Coursera / my ISP etc., Resolved,4

Within IDLE click the Options menu in the toolbar and select IDLE Preferences.In the Highlighting tab there should be two radio buttons labelled Foreground and Background. Click the relevant radio button you want to edit and then click Choose Colour for:. This should then allow you to change the colour for both the text (foreground) and the background as well as highlighting options., Resolved,7
