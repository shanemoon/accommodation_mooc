Wednesday September 25th 2013 8:52 am -04:00,Hello I have everything working in the assignment except the last two functions with read. I have there only one line which seems insufficient.open(words_file r)When I run the driver and choose files I get following error in the shell:Traceback (most recent call last):  File D:\Python33\a3_driver.py line 88 in <module>    words = a3.read_words(words_file)  File D:\Python33\a3.py line 223 in read_words    open(words_file r)TypeError: invalid file: <_io.TextIOWrapper name=D:/Python33/wordlist1.txt mode=r encoding=cp1250>Any idea what the problem could be? I have no idea. :(, Unresolved,0
Wednesday September 25th 2013 10:09 am -04:00,From what I see in the driver code the driver tries to open it by calling the read_words function in a3.py no?I was wondering what should be in the read_words function and I just realized that I should also read the contents right? , Unresolved,0

Wednesday September 25th 2013 12:11 pm -04:00,I see what you mean.I used the function read and returned it but it put every character on a single line. Is there anyway put it into rectangular board without changing the driver?, Unresolved,0
