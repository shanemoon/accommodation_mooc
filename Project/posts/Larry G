Friday August 23rd 2013 8:42 pm -04:00,Do we need to register in LTP2 to access the materials? Is this still possible since the course is officially over., Resolved,1

Thursday August 29th 2013 2:50 am -04:00,After calling functions and re assignments of values will the memory addresses got erased in the main body (assuming there are no global value)?  I am curious whether the memory address will get polluted with temporary values and clogged up memory storage., Resolved,0
Thursday August 29th 2013 2:37 am -04:00,I just completed the assignment.The assignment appears overwhelming at first.  There is no need for complicated coding and the examples allow you to test your code.The feedback from auto-test shows which functions are not working but the details in the last column are hard to decipher. This means that you have to find your own mistakes.   It is more difficult than I thought and it is not the fainthearted who is starting to learn programming for first time.  Programming requires a certain amount of perseverance and hard work to succeed.  I am keeping my fingers crossed for future assignments.   , Unresolved,3
Sunday September 1st 2013 11:05 pm -04:00,I think it depends on workload of the autotest and number of people logging in the assignment at that time.When I was doing the assignment I got my turnaround feedback almost immediately., Resolved,1
Sunday September 1st 2013 11:01 pm -04:00,I also saw my score went up to 42/41 from 41/41.It just happened no additional work is required. , Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 8:18 pm -04:00,I think the above posters are expressing their own understanding and interpretation of the additional mark.We need clearer explanations from the instructors:      Do we need to do the additional test to obtain the additional mark?      Or is the additional mark automatically given to all those who had completed their tests earlier?I believe there are people who set aside the time from their busy schedule to complete the assignment.And for some people to revisit the another test again requires more than normal additional work for that extra mark. So why penalize those who have completed their assignment early and diligently., Unresolved,0
Friday September 13th 2013 11:38 pm -04:00,In the submission panel for review and testing there is another box for Additional Submission for uploading files.I usually submit my program codes for testing using the first option. How do we use this second option?, Unresolved,0
Sunday September 15th 2013 8:40 am -04:00,There are 2 methods mentioned in the assignment instructions.I used the first method and the my coding is not pretty but it works.This is the hardest section in the whole assignment for me., Resolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 10:50 am -04:00,This stumped me!The format of the call function and return value should be :  >>>while_version ( [1 5 7 8 9] )13, Resolved,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 8:35 am -04:00,There is Save Answers button at the end of every quiz.Does it mean that we can save a partially completed exercise when we  logged out. Later when we logged in again we can continue the same exercise with our saved answers.    ,None,0
Thursday September 19th 2013 9:31 am -04:00,Do you notice that every time you saved your answers  the order of the answers in the question are changed.A side effect is that if you leave a question answer blank then the next time you look at it again the answers will appear in a different order.  This could cause some disorientation if you want to go back to redo the question!  ,None,0
