Thursday October 3rd 2013 6:54 pm -04:00,im sorry for the probably stupid question but I still dont understand the meaning of being out of range. is it just because in the code there is no limit on the range value and that is why when running mystery(abc) the code doesnt know what to do after i=2+1 (which is 3) and so since there is no i=3 in the string it gives an error?Â is that right?help?, Resolved,0
