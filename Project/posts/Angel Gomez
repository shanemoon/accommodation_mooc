Saturday August 31st 2013 12:44 pm -04:00,I completely lost everything seems to be very simple but anything make sense to me please dont get me wrong its me not you your courses are very interesting but I cannot get the logic of it so many instructions to learn fast. Do you have a list of the instructions or commands to print out and have it handy close to my computer?Thank you for this opportunity to learn programming it is my dream to create a small program some day now is my chance but maybe I want to learn so fast that I am getting frustrated so easy. ,None,0

Monday September 9th 2013 10:51 pm -04:00,Thanks to everybody this community is the best for anyone in need to learn but still I have no clue how to make sense on all the commands or string or lines or anything maybe the only reason is that I am already too old to learn anything Ive tried all the suggestions but still I have no good understanding of programming maybe sound illogic . For example I cannot understand why sometimes the window has lines w/ numbers and sometimes just a regular window and sometimes you cannot enter anything. Iam feeling ashamed of myself.,None,0
