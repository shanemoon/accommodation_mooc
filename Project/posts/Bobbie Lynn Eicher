Thats good because it helps you to jump in and get some real work done quickly and it gives you enjoy to work with that you can gain a feel for whats going on through trial and error.A Computer Science approach tends to focus more on trying to get you to understand WHY the computer responds in certain ways so that you have a deeper understanding of its behavior but its slower to move you forward on what you can actually do. If you aspire to eventually do things where getting all the details right is profoundly important (like messing around with programming operating systems or cryptography) understanding all the details is a big deal. If youre just looking to gain access to some functional tools and you have room for error in your projects you dont necessarily need that kind of depth(I also suspect that they could stand to flesh out some topics like stack frames and why theyre using the virtualizer more. I think I know what theyre trying to do but I feel like theyre not communicating it as clearly as they could be.),None,8

Its designed to be a transition course from high school to college math to adjust to the more structured and logical thinking you need and I think that also makes it potentially valuable to people who want to program.,None,0
