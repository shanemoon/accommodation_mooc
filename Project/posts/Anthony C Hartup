Monday September 2nd 2013 12:25 am -04:00,I can see how hard this would be for someone not used to programming. Ive done a bit of programming in the past but the first weeks have still been a challenge. It is really hard to get your head around but when things finally work its incredible and you just cant stop.Some of your problems may stem from using IDLE incorrectly I wasted a couple of hours deleting one lot of good code after another because I was entering it into IDLE the wrong way.Keep at it youll get there., Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 12:06 am -04:00,Hi Is it just me or is the world clock GUI out by an hour. When I set one clock to local time it correctly states the time in Australia where I am but if I use the UTC offset for here it is an hour out. Ive set one of the other clocks to -4.00 so I know what time it is in Canada but I had to change it to -3.00 to get the correct time., Unresolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 12:56 am -04:00,Toronto is -4.00 with daylight savings and -5.00 without (I got that from the timeanddate.com website I assume its accurate). I cant see why Id need to set it to -3.00 to match their current time. My assignment passed 41/41 so it doesnt really matter. Ill have a play with the code and see what I can do., Unresolved,0
