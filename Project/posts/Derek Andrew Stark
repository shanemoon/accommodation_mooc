Monday August 19th 2013 1:33 am -04:00,I have Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist on my shelf. I didnt get past the second chapter. Not because it was dull or anything but because I lacked the motivation. Hopefully being enrolled in this course will help. Duolingo is notorious for that badge system you mentioned. Almost more of a distraction in my opinion. , Pinned Approved,1
Thursday September 5th 2013 7:22 pm -04:00,Thanks for the suggestion Martha. I have been keeping up with the book recently and have written my notes while I experimented with the code. , Pinned Approved,0
Monday August 19th 2013 1:35 am -04:00,Would Tempe count? This is pretty much my first course on programming as well but I am invested in learning as much as possible. ,None,0
Friday August 23rd 2013 10:51 pm -04:00,Does anybody know why the built in found function in python rounds down from 0.5? I am curious just because it seems to go against what I learned in math and perhaps this makes some coding more convenient down the line. Thanks. ,None,0
Saturday August 24th 2013 2:07 am -04:00,Ah that is interesting. I should have just checked the documentation myself. Thanks for doing the dirty work. ,None,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 1:39 am -04:00,I am in the same boat as you anonymous. The concepts in the lecture videos were easy to grasp but that exercise was a tough one. I just completed it after a hard day of work and feel bogged down. Keep tinkering with your formulas and Im sure you will get it eventually. , Resolved,0
Wednesday September 11th 2013 4:15 pm -04:00,The only MOOC I have finished from start to finish has been CS101 by Nick Parlante. That was a very enjoyable one. Im hoping Cryptography and Logic will be up there as well. What about you all? What is your favorite? ,None,1
Thursday September 12th 2013 6:28 pm -04:00,Im in Mathematical Thought now and enjoy it. Not a huge fan of the pace but I bought his book online and am excited to read it. I hope it will help with programming classes in the future. There really are a ton of classes ... and so few time. ,None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 6:30 pm -04:00,Im enrolled in that class right now. I was confused with the structure of the course. There just seems to be a lot going on but a sudoku solver program! Thats awesome. Definitely staying in that course now. Im assuming you are more than comfortable with design recipes then? ,None,0
Thursday September 12th 2013 6:31 pm -04:00,I got about a third through Interactive Programming in Python the first time round but that was more than enough to make the material posted in this course feel like a joke. What do you think of this course after having taking that one?,None,0
Friday September 13th 2013 4:23 pm -04:00,Thats interesting. I did not know that MIT had a python course. May have to check that out after interactive. ,None,0
Monday September 23rd 2013 11:18 pm -04:00,What will happen if I just let this program run forever? Will my computer eventually explode?,None,2
