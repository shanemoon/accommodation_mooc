Tuesday September 24th 2013 2:06 am -04:00,for the life of me i have seen what i need to do to get the list [A N T T] to get to ANTT but everything i am trying is coming up with [A N T T]. am i missing over a lecture where they went over how to do this? I am trying to get on top of this assignment as soon as possible but i am lost and cant really go on without having this one sorted. is there a way i can post what i have and get some help figuring how to unlock the mystery. i have spent about 3 hours trying to figure this out and at this rate i will never get it., Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 3:06 am -04:00,do i need to add a for statement at all? it is at this stage i tend to get stuck, Unresolved,0
Tuesday September 24th 2013 6:10 am -04:00,ok now i feel even more stupid. i get this part but now i cant convert the list to a string. I know for a lot taking this course this must seem stupid but for me this is very different and difficult to pick up, Unresolved,1
Thursday September 26th 2013 8:18 pm -04:00,I am still having a lot of trouble with this i cannot for the life of me figure out what i am doing wrong. I  have spent approximately 8 hours on this task alone and I do not think it is helping at all looking at the forums i have been looking at all of the threads regarding these and i think i am getting closer to the end but then fail miserably and either can only get the first element of the str or the list. if i throw my code up can people please judge me and let me know where i am failing at this? row_string =         for i in range(len(board)):        row_string = row_string + board[row_index][i]        return row_stringthis of course will give the result A, Unresolved,1
Friday September 27th 2013 2:44 am -04:00,I have read all of the posts on here not just this one and i am once again stuck beyond belief. I have used all of the codes above to see if i could figure out where they went wrong and i cant for the life of me figure this out. this is what i have after looking and i think i am about another 10 hours away from giving up as i think this is going well over my head, Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 2:47 am -04:00,forgot to add the code here it iscolumn_string =     c = 0    for c in board[c]:        for row in column_index:         column_string = column_string  + board[c][column_index]    return column_string, Resolved,0
Friday September 27th 2013 3:54 am -04:00,i went through all of this and i was thinking about it and it was still giving me a problem but sorted that out so thank you very much i am starting to understand things a little better now still not great but better than before. thank you very much , Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 6:38 am -04:00,ihave this and it works for some things but not for others i think this is affecting my next part toofor column_index in range(len(board)):        if word in make_str_from_column(board column_index):            return True    return False, Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 5:40 am -04:00,ok i am having the same lack of luck as others and even after reading all of the expert stuff from tom which i am glad someone is able to help like he is i am still stuck on this and i have tried to do this as simple as i could but here is what i have and any help on what im doing wrong will be gratefulif word in board_contains_word_in_row(board word) or word in board_contains_word_in_column(board word):        return True        return False, Resolved,0
Saturday September 28th 2013 5:47 am -04:00,tried this and it comes up with the errorTraceback (most recent call last):  File <pyshell#3> line 1    board_contains_word([[A N T T] [X S O B]] ANT)  File C:\Users\Michael\Documents\corsera\learn to program\a3.py line 116 in board_contains_word    if word in board_contains_word_in_row(board word) or board_contains_word_in_column(board word):TypeError: argument of type bool is not iterable, Resolved,0
