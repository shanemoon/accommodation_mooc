Friday October 4th 2013 5:58 am -04:00,Hello everybodyIn my case it didn´t work because of the names of the Strings:that´s my code:  str1.find(str2 str1.find(str2) + 1)(I used STR1 and STR2  instead S1 and S2 and the program take it as incorrect but it isnt  I only was following the terminology learned before (string --> str)by the way... I´m happy my code was correct at the first try.See you!, Resolved,0
