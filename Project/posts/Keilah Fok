Sunday September 1st 2013 6:18 pm -04:00,Ill give you a hint. The two functions given are count_vowels and count_consonants. What is the number of letters in a word in terms of those two functions?Remember to use the given parameters. Also you should not have count_letters in your return statement. You are creating a function so you cant call it yet.I hope this helps!, Resolved,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 6:14 pm -04:00,Before this class I took an introductory physics class on Coursera. I learned some basic Python from that class such as commenting while loops assignment statements for loops displays printing graphs etc. For one of the assignments I tried to create a model of the solar system using Python. It never quite worked. Can someone who knows physics and Python tell me what went wrong with this code?Thanks!http://paste.debian.net/hidden/1548f1d8/,None,0

Sunday September 1st 2013 9:08 pm -04:00,Should I add the visual and physutil models?,None,0
Sunday September 1st 2013 9:06 pm -04:00,Thanks everybody for the suggestions and information. I will try starting with just a few planets and working my way up from there. Maybe by the end of the course I will have something to show for it. Of course as Alan said it is an extremely complicated system and having to have a large time scale doesnt help.,None,0

Friday September 13th 2013 11:58 pm -04:00,Thanks everybody for the helpful commentary. I am currently too busy to work on this but once I find time I will try your suggestions.,None,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 5:49 pm -04:00,Yes the code is written via vpython. I installed it when I took the Introductory Physics 1 with Lab class on Coursera. I think the class is running again so you can check it out. The week 1 lectures have instructions on how to install vpython. Then you can quit the course.,None,1

Thursday September 26th 2013 9:42 pm -04:00,The term docstring description is used in the homework. The docstring is the description of what a function does., Unresolved,0

Saturday September 28th 2013 6:58 pm -04:00,Oh I got it. Hint: reread the precondition., Unresolved,0
Tuesday October 1st 2013 5:46 pm -04:00,I just want to be able to see what questions I get wrong and why., Resolved,0
Friday October 4th 2013 12:57 am -04:00,Yes thats what I meant. I know we will not see our scores until then but I didnt know if we would get feedback., Resolved,0
