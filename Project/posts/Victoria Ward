Tuesday September 10th 2013 9:03 am -04:00,Hi allI was just wondering if anyone else is having any problems when they submit their code -Â Ive written the function is_valid a number of different ways all work fine in python and all examples check out but I keep getting four errors for this function when I submit it. Anyone else having similar problems or could suggest anything obvious I might be getting wrong?isIf not Ill post some of the versions of the code Ive written and see if anyone can spot anything., Resolved,0
