Monday September 2nd 2013 6:10 pm -04:00,Thanks guys for your help. Unfortunately I had the exercise nearly finished when my browser crashed. I really do not feel like repeating this entire exercise again. Its pretty hard to get my head around it as its my first time learning programming !! Im not sure if Ill continue with this course !!, Resolved,0
Monday September 2nd 2013 7:53 pm -04:00,I did it again. It took quite a while and a lot of head scratching LOL . I didnt do so good. Hopefully I will get a better understanding of python soon. Thanks all :), Resolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 6:54 am -04:00,Hi I tried putting this post in the relevant post. But I could not mark it as unresolved therefore no one will check it so I apologize in advance if this is in the wrong place.I did assignment  2 twice and neither time it showed up in assignment scores. When I check Exercises however and go into exercise 2 it shows up as attempted once. How come the score hasnt updated yet though ??? Also I cannot see assignment 3 details. Will I have to download another python visualizer with new code in it for this separate assignment  ?, Unresolved,0
Friday September 6th 2013 6:43 am -04:00,I did assignment  2 twice and neither time it showed up. It says that Ive only attempted it once how ever but not to worry. How come the score hasnt updated yet though ??? Also I cannot see assignment 3 details.

Friday September 6th 2013 2:07 pm -04:00,Hi Jonathon I dont see any assignments to do.. I thought that was the scoring for the Exercises. Do we have to do assignments to do as well as exercises ?. All I see at the link you sent me is an assignment list  then click on link and a handout.. , Resolved,0
