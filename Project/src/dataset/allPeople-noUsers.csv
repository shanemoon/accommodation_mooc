"Ariane, that's awesome. :-)Chiara, it took about 20 hours to create the survey and analyze the results -- I'm sorry, but with our semester starting on Monday we just don't have time to redo it!",instructor
"Last September, with exactly the same course material, we ran a workload survey in week 3. That survey asked how many hours were spent on these tasks: Week 1 lectures Exercise 1 In week 1, Python study with other materials, such as online books Week 2 lectures Exercise 2 Assignment 1 In week 2, Python study with other materials, such as online books The survey also asked how much programming experience people had: no experience written a few small programs or tried to take another programming course but didn't complete it completed an introductory programming course significant programming experience Almost 12,000 people completed the survey. Here are the results: 4176 people have no experience in programming: beginner results 3335 people have a little bit of programming experience: only-a-little-experience results 2681 people have completed a programming course: one-course-taken results 1806 people consider themselves to be experienced programmers: experienced results 11989 people responded: combined results The biggest takeaway for us was just how much of spread there was in hours spent -- it's huge! Add up the hours range for the biggest bars, though, and you come out quite close to the 6-8 hour time estimate. ",instructor
"No need to apologize! The description in the handout for get_seconds says this: The parameter is a number of seconds since midnight. Return the number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight as seen on a clock. (This means that the return value should be in the range 0 to 59, inclusive.)Your code instead returns a number in the range 0-23, because you're calling function to_24_hour_clock, which converts a number of hours to a time on a 24 hour clock (it uses % 24 to do this). Is that a good enough hint? I'm happy to keep going! ",instructor
"Gah, sorry. It's a per-assignment setting and I had neglected to update it for A3.",instructor
"You're right about b! I've fixed it.For c, remember that \ is the escape character for strings, so \' means a single quote.",instructor
"Ah -- on the left, about halfway down, is a link called ""Exercises"". (It really should be called ""Exercise solutions""; I'll ask them to update that.) Click it to see the solutions.",instructor
"The second Anonymous here had a lovely suggestion: work it out on paper first, and think about it in small steps.And you're doing exactly what you should do when you need help: ask on the forums! These forums are a replacement for in-person interaction. Please feel free to ask lots of questions!",instructor

I haven't used PyCharm for more than 5 minutes, so please feel free to start a discussion thread on the Course Tools board to help each other.",instructor
"I believe it is. Windows 7 and 8 have Aero Snap built in, which has keyboard shortcuts:http://www.sevenforums.com/software/389-windows-7-aero-snap-keyboard-shortcuts.htmlFor Linux, Compiz is a powerful window manager:http://www.compiz.org",instructor
"I'm sorry, but most of the time the middle is taken up with code and other artefacts.",instructor
"Advanced discussion here. You'll understand it all by the end of the course.Passing an argument to a parameter has the same effect as an assignment statement: the parameter ends up containing the memory address of the value. If that value is mutable, such as a list, then you can change its contents:>>> def f(lst):...    lst.append(3)... >>> L = [1, 2]>>> f(L)>>> L[1, 2, 3]In your example, though, you're not mutating the value itself; instead, in your function body you reassign to parameter x. Also, that parameter x is not the same x outside the function; the one outside is a global variable.Is that enough explanation? I'm happy to keep going!",instructor
"Crafting Quality Code has this course as a prerequisite, so you have a strong argument that you've mastered the material in this course.",instructor
"There are several threads in the Course Tools discussion board that provide instructions for installing Python 3 in Linux. One of the problems is that there are many Linux distributions, and several installation mechanisms. Try searching for the distribution you use in the Course Tools board.",instructor
The problem with that wording is that it isn't accurate -- variable x contains a memory address and not the value. The terminology we're using in this course is that x refers to a value.,instructor
"Try copying and pasting these into the IDLE shell:round(3.14156265359)round(3.14156265359, 1)round(3.14156265359, 2)round(3.14156265359, 3)",instructor
We indeed had trouble with the microphone we were using early on. Apologies!,instructor
"Sorry Michael, which question was this? Was it the one at 5:33?",instructor
"On OS X, I've been using Slate for my window management:https://github.com/jigish/slateThat might be overkill, though; I spent a couple of hours tweaking it until it did just what i want. Spectacle is quite good:http://spectacleapp.com",instructor
"The video quizzes are done using Javascript, and aren't part of the video itself. That's why you need to be online to see them.",instructor
"I recommend using the Python Visualizer link on the Resources page -- our link has all the settings we use for this course.Edit: our link also takes you to pythontutor.com, but with settings that match what we use.",instructor
Many people completed the first offering of the course without the book. That's only there in case you want addition reading and exercises.Please don't pirate books.,instructor
"Each lecture has its own discussion board (click on the ""Discuss"" button in the center-bottom of each video). Is that enough?",instructor
Well done!,instructor
"We will go deeper! Variables are central to programming, and you'll be using them throughout the course. Almost every single task will involve variables, so you'll get a ton of practice.Please also use the Python Visualizer to explore code executing, including how variables behave -- the link is available from the Resources page.",instructor
"Hmm, in Python they are sequential: with operators of the same precedence, the order of evaluation is left to right.",instructor
"What is the expected range of the return value for get_seconds, and what range are you getting when you call to_24_hour_clock?",instructor
"I'm not sure that a percentage is the way to make that decision. If it were me, I'd switch when all of the 3rd party packages that I needed had been ported. If even one that I relied heavily on hasn't been ported, I wouldn't switch.Another reason to not switch is if you have a large Python 2 codebase and no time to run 2to3 on it and then test the results.Here's an in-depth article outlining the issues:http://python3porting.com/strategies.html",instructor
I've just updated that question. Any better?,instructor
"Yup, we will leave that link up. However, you can pick the settings to match ours; here's a picture:",instructor
The Python expression may evaluate to True or it may evaluate the False; each of the English sentences may be true or may be false. Which English sentence is true exactly when the Python expression evaluates to True?,instructor
"The reason why we start with this is because it should be the easiest part: you know what data you have (the arguments) and you know what data you want (the return value). If you haven't figured out these two things, then you can't write code to do it!",instructor
"I play in the Society for Creative Anachronism [http://sca.org/], a group that studies medieval life. It's an odd set of rules -- we use rattan instead of metal, so perhaps ""stick fighting"" would be closer. Because we use rattan, though, we can hit full force. It's not just armoured combat, though: there's everything from weaving to glassblowing to cooking using medieval recipes. A favourite event is Pennsic [http://pennsicwar.org/], a 2-week camping event with 10,000 people that happens in western Pennsylvania. (Best shopping ever.)Typical scotches: Dalwhinnie (especially in the summer), Balvenie, Dalmore, Oban. I find heavy peat to be a bit too much. You?",instructor
"Tim, are you using Internet Explorer? That browser seems to cause problems when downloading files. Can you maybe try Firefox?",instructor
"Somrik, if it happens again please post in this thread and we'll get it fixed.",instructor
"Sudhanshu, that looks like your answer is 25.0 when it should be 1.0 -- notice that the assignment handout says ""Be sure to callto_24_hour_clock to convert the time to a time on a 24 hour clock before returning.""",instructor
"Subhash, check the indentation in time_from_utc. :-)Byrd, I see that you've made progress -- are you in better shape now?Anyone else still stuck?",instructor
Do you happen to be using Internet Explorer? That seems to add a bunch of stuff to a1.py when you download it. In our a1.py there aren't any of the =0A= markers.,instructor
I see that you now have a 34. Does that make more sense now?,instructor
"Two reasons (that I can think of).1) Because we want people to work mostly as a cohort. We've got some very helpful folks who have come out of the woodwork to help each other, and I don't think that would happen if people worked at their own pace.2) The more practical reason: we're editing the material as we go, cleaning up sound, removing our stuttering and misspeaks, making the summaries better, and so on. We're just barely ahead of the material.",instructor
"Eventually, if you continue to program after this course, yes -- every development environment comes with a debugger that works a lot like IDLE's, and learning your way around one is necessary to becoming a professional programmer.",instructor
"Hmm, can you post a screenshot here?",instructor
Do you mean the in-video quizzes? I see them in the first couple of videos. Or do you mean the exercise?,instructor
"No, they should work identically. Can you copy and paste the code and errors you're getting? You can format them here by selecting the code and clicking the <code> tag above the editing area.",instructor
"That's a nice suggestion, thank you! I've made a note to fix that the next time I get a chance.",instructor
"It's purely an instructional method. It is used in many built-in functions, though:>>> help(abs)Help on built-in function abs in module builtins: abs(...) abs(number) -> number Return the absolute value of the argument.And if you provide it some tools such as IDLE will show that information.",instructor
"I completely understand, and we're trying to be as clear as we can. (We ran into issues with that the first time we ran the course so we're aware that we need to be careful.)",instructor
"We'll be posting the videos, assignments, and exercises every Monday at 11:59 EDT. (1 minute before noon, Toronto time.)",instructor
"That's a feature that Coursera provides in case an instructor wants to let people submit 2 files. We're not using it for LTP1, and you can ignore it.",instructor
Not timed.,instructor

"That's awesome to hear! And excellent positive feedback, which we always appreciate.",instructor
"This is advanced. Please don't worry if you're completely lost with this post. You'll understand most of it by the end of the course.In week 7, you're going to learn about dictionaries, which allows you to define mappings between keys and values, much like a regular dictionary maps words to definitions. (This is directly relevant to the question in this thread! Don't worry if it doesn't make complete sense yet; come back to this after week 7.)Here, 'a' is mapped to 'b', and 'c' is mapped to 'd':>>> a_dictionary = {'a': 'b', 'c': 'd'}We can look up a value given a key:>>> a_dictionary['a'] 'b'The reason this is relevant is because Python uses dictionaries to keep track of variables and their values. Every running function (and the Python shell itself) is given a dictionary to keep track of the values of its parameters and local variables. You can access these various dictionaries using built-in function locals:>>> my_variable = 'abracadabra' >>> locals() {'__doc__': None, '__package__': None, 'my_variable': 'abracadabra', '__name__': '__main__', '__builtins__': <module 'builtins' (built-in)>, '__loader__': <class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>} Notice the 'my_variable': 'abracadabra' entry! Python turns variables into strings and saves them in a dictionary. And that is why variables are separate from their values in Python.For the rest of the entries, anything starting and ending with 2 underscores is special to Python.  Notice the '__builtins__': <module 'builtins' (built-in)> entry -- that's how Python accesses the built-in functions.",instructor
"That's actually a tricky question to answer because Python keeps some common values in memory but recycles less-common ones. Small integers (-5 to 256, I think?) are kept around, or cached, but everything else is recycled, or garbage collected, or ""garbage collected"". Some strings are also cached.",instructor
"I respectfully disagree. I've found that understanding the memory model helps a lot with the concepts that we're going to encounter in the next several weeks. It's harder for the simple stuff, but it makes future concepts much, much easier. Much.Check out the Python Visualizer, available from the Resources page.",instructor
"We need to start somewhere, and everyone is familiar with simple mathematical expressions. We'll get to more advanced stuff, I promise!",instructor
"I've reworded the question to say this:Add enough parentheses to the expression 3 + 4 / 2 - 7 so that the operations are evaluated in the following order: +, -, /.Is that clearer?",instructor
Sorry about that -- I've submitted a request to recaption. It usually takes a day or two.,instructor
What happens when you double-click on IDLE? Do you get an error message?,instructor
"We went the other direction -- we're allowing people to submit up to a week ""late"" with no penalty.",instructor
"Whoops! That ""stores"" should be ""contains"" -- I've just fixed it.Background: to store something is to put it somewhere. To contain something is to hold it. Python stores memory addresses inside variables, and variables contain those memory addresses. It's not the variable that is doing the storing.",instructor
"Ahmed, thanks! Can you please look through here and let us know if you run into issues? http://help.coursera.org/customer/portal/articles/864122-i-love-coursera-how-can-i-help-or-volunteer...",instructor

"Close! 'variable' is more general that 'parameter': in the code below, there are two variables, x and y. def f(y): return y * 2 x = 3 f(x) y is also a parameter, but x is not. Also, x is used as an argument in function call f(x). A parameter is a variable that appears between the parentheses in a function header, and an argument is an expression that appears between the parentheses of a function call.",instructor
"Last March, we ran a 5-week followup course called ""Learn to Program: Crafting Quality Code"". The material is still available:https://www.coursera.org/course/programming2We don't currently have plans to re-run it, but we'll be leaving that offering open so that you can watch the videos and do (some of) the exercises and assignments.",instructor

That's because we're nervously excited!,instructor
"The big problem is that the Mac comes with Python 2.6, and Python 3 has several changes that mean Python 2 won't work with this course.",instructor
That was an accident -- we had weeks 5 and 7 set as visible. I'm glad we didn't do that with the final exam! :-),instructor
Ouch! I'm so sorry about that -- I've updated the questions so that clicking greeting.py opens it in a new window.,instructor
"I agree, it's a very nice idea.",instructor
"Every programmer needs a mental model (not necessarily visual) of what happens as a program executes -- otherwise, they wouldn't . The visualizer presents a model that I and quite a few other programmers think in as we program. Any model that accurately predicts program execution is fine! However, any correct model will match exactly what the visualizer presents, so if you have a model that doesn't match the one in the visualizer, it is very likely that there is a misunderstanding.",instructor
"If you follow the Function Design Recipe, you end up with a function definition: header, docstring, and body.",instructor
"Anonymous, can you please let me know whether the new instructions in Step 2 help get you started?",instructor
"The first offering started with about 70,000 people, had 85,000 registered by the end of the course, and ended with over 144,000 (!) by the beginning of this offering.Of the 70,000 or so, about 9,500 wrote the exam and of them 9,000 earned a certificate. So indeed participation drops quickly, for all the reasons that Anonymous listed.",instructor
"The main problem with that is that we often can't monitor the boards or fix errors on the weekend. We tried that during the first offering, and we had some very bad experiences with exploding threads of complaints.That's also the main reason why we made the hard deadline have no penalty, and set it a week after the due date -- so that people who fall behind have a chance to catch up.",instructor
"Why do I have a DisabledBuiltinError? You're probably trying to call the open function from your code. Notice that none of the function docstrings say that any of the arguments passed in to any of the functions are file names. The type contracts list arguments as being of type ""file open for reading"", not ""str"" as would the case if we wanted you to open any files. Instead, when testing your code, you should open the file in the shell and call your functions, passing in that opened file.",instructor
"This thread is for frequently-asked questions. Only Community TAs, instructors, and other staff should post here.Other posts may be deleted on sight: please start a new thread if you have a question about A3.",instructor
"These two concepts are quite different:Some objects, such as lists, are mutable.Variables can be reassigned. Reassigning a variable, as you do in the code above, makes that variable point to a different object. That is different than changing the contents of the object that a variable points to.Does that difference make sense?",instructor

"I agree! And it's even worse than just learning English, because we're using programming terms like ""value"" and ""type"" with particular meanings -- people who are fluent in English also have trouble with these issues, but learning programming terminology (and agreeing on exact definitions) will help a great deal with future topics.",instructor
"Linda, do you remember exactly what you typed?",instructor
"I think you'd agree that clarity in documentation is important; part of that is choosing a convention, and the convention we're using is that we're not using parentheses on the return type.(It's surely a bit pedantic of me, but I believe that teaching about code style is part of teaching about programing.)",instructor
"I took a look at your answers, and it looks like for a few questions you provided a type (float, for example) rather than a value, and the questions were asking you to provide values. (Had we wanted the type, we would have asked something like ""what is the type of the value that x refers to"").",instructor
"In programming, ""return"" has a specific meaning: produce a value as a result of a function call. So the phrase ""return the number to the screen"" isn't in programming-speak, and we'll never use it like that.Function print changes the pixels on your screen; it doesn't return a value (other than None).",instructor

"You can submit as many times as you like (although if the server load gets heavy we'll probably restrict submissions to once every 10 minutes or so).So you can submit your file every time you finish a function if you like, or you can wait until you have several or all of them done.There is no penalty for submitting multiple times.",instructor
"There is only one module, and each function (such as seconds_difference) should be inside that module. Submit that file in the code submission, not the additional submission.",instructor
"Numbers like 2.3 will never be returned by the function -- there are never a fractional number of vowels. When writing a contract, it's better to be as specific as possible with each type.",instructor
"Your return statement should be indented as well:def area(base, height): '''(number, number) -> number Return the area of a triangle with dimensions base and height. ''' return base * height / 2",instructor
"The biggest problem with this is the possibility of technical problems: Coursera issues, problems with the autotesting software, that sort of thing.

"Gerard, When you use the ""Run Module"" functionality of IDLE, it's pretty much the same thing as pasting the code into the shell, except it does a quick Syntax check on the file first. There's a modified version of the import statement that produces a similar result in Python: from module import * However, doing this is sometimes considered bad practice. If you have previously defined a function and the module contains a function with the same name, the function you had will be silently replaced by the function in module, which can trigger unexpected behavior.",instructor
"I you try in IDLE, remember you have to use the options inside the function body, or bad things will ensue. Did you do that?",instructor

"Your solution is perfectly fine, but the course staff cannot program the quiz to accept every possible way to solve this problem in python, after all: return (12 <= temp <= 28) != Truereturn ((12 <= temp <= 28) != True)return not not ((12 <= temp <= 28) != True)return not not ((12 <= temp <= 28) == False)return not not (((12 <= temp <= 28) != True))return not not not not ((12 <= temp + 1 - 1 <= 28) != True)All of those would work too, but the quiz cannot check for everything.",instructor
"João I'm not sure what you're saying, you think there is a problem with the proposed answer?",instructor
That's because the program cannot possibly check for every valid python expression that would solve this problem. There is to hints for that problem: - Use the or operator. - Do not use parenthesis.,instructor

"Ok, well in that case, you should locate the folder in which IDLE does the initial search when you want to open a file, and move your a1.py there. If you can't locate it, maybe you can also navigate to where the file is when you use IDLE's open menu. Third solution, use IDLE's File -> New to create a new file, use this link to access the code in the file in your browser, copy all the code and paste it in the new IDLE editor window, then save it.",instructor

"Well, when Python evaluates a boolean expression, the last thing evaluated becomes the value of that expression. >>> True and 'T''T'>>> False and 'T'False>>> False or 'T''T' Recall the rules for evaluating boolean expressions: From left to right and binds more strongly than or. (It has higher precedence) If the left hand side of an and expression is False, the right hand side is not evaluated The right hand side of an or expression is only evaluated if the left hand side is False. And there's an extra rule: if a string shows up in place of a boolean value, it's considered False if it's the empty string '' and True if it's not. So in the code nuc == 'A' and 'T' if the left hand side is True, because it's an and operator, the right hand side is evaluated, it's value is 'T' so it becomes the value for the expression and because what follows Is the right hand side of an or expression, it's not evaluated. However if nuc is not equal to 'A' then the whole and expression evaluates to False and the right hand side of the or expression Is then evaluated, etc... ",instructor

"Alright, you open a1.py in IDLE, and then: Tackle the very first function definition in the file: seconds_differenceWhat I recommend you do is type this in IDLE: >>> time_1 = 3600.0>>> time_2 = 1800.0Now, you have two variables, with the same name as the parameters in the function.Play around in IDLE, using the first week material, especially from the ""Python as a calculator"" and ""Variables"" videos.Use those variables, and arithmetic operators to write in expressions, and evaluate them.Try different operators and different orders for the variables. When one of the expression evaluates to -1800.0, you will have most likely found the exact expression that you need to write in your return statement.So, add that body to the function, then try and run the module in IDLE.If it runs fine, and you see the RESTART status message, try and copy the examples from the docstring of the function into the IDLE shell, and see if they produce the expected results. When you have successfully tried all the examples in the docstring, go to the assignment page and upload your modified file (make sure you're really uploading the file you worked on, people forget that a lot.) With chance, you should see that your function has passed some tests, and earned you some points.Then, you will be on track to go on to Step 3.Can you try that?Cheers ",instructor
"Yes, you need to define the function yourself. No starter code is provided for that function. Try and follow the function design recipe, and you shouldn't have any problem.",instructor

"I'm gonna try and come up with an acceptable response, but I think that ultimately, this would be better handled by an instructor. There is actually some value to the concept of not ""concern[ing] yourself with how it does this"". In a lot of situations, you won't be able to know such a thing, and will have to use the tools at your disposal either way. To illustrate my point, I'm gonna try and explain how the longer function would do it: It would be a Python function that calls the len() built-in Python function twice, and compares each calls with a comparison operator. It would then, based on the result of that comparison, return the string passed as argument that has the biggest length. Please note that at the time of AK's posting, we were still in Week 2, so in order to answer the ""how"", he would have had to introduce Week 3 concepts. Now, that was a rather short-to-explain example, but in the future, you will have to use tools to solve problems, and you won't, at all, be able to know how they work. During the second Week of the course, I coded a crude tool in Python to help with producing the PDF versions of the in-video quizzes. I did that because without the tool, the process of generating said quizzes would have been extremely painful: Take three screenshots for each question, (question, correct answer, explanation)Manually cut each image so that only the interesting part of the screen would remain in the image.Create a new file to hold that ""cut"" version of each image.Name each new file in a sequential manner.Convert each cut file to PDFsGlue each of those PDF files together to produce the final PDF documentNow that I have the tool, I can just take screenshots and run the tool to produce the final PDF. To code that tool, I used a Python module named ""PyPNG"". I had to use a number of functions from that module, and the point of the exercise was to do less work, not more. So I consulted the module documentation for each function, and did not concern myself with how they worked, only with what they were supposed to do, and how I was supposed to use them and build on their work. That kind of scenario is, as I understand it, one of the main points of the concept of ""function reuse"". I think the whole point of the exercise, is to help students figure out what information is important and what information they can safely ignore.I hope I managed to answer your question somewhat. If I didn't, please don't hold that against me, and please keep in mind that the CTAs in this course are people who try and help however they can but were never actually trained for this.",instructor

"When the line return g(y) is executed, y is first evaluated and replaced with its value: the object 1. Then, the function g is called with 1 as an argument, and inside of the function call, the parameter x is made to point to the object 1. In python, the memory management model is designed so that existing objects are not automatically duplicated, but reused when possible, whereas in some other language, each parameter would end up in a truly ""local"" variable. At the point in the execution where your screenshot was taken, both y (Edit: the y in the frame of the function f) and x are pointing to the same object, value 1. If you step forward in the execution, you'll see that the object 1 cease to exist when the f() function call returns, because the value is not needed anymore.",instructor
"Yes, that's because the function does not return a value. It prints it.",instructor

It seems like I need to add that one to the FAQ. You probably have a Syntax error somewhere in your file. I previously experienced that result by removing a colon at the end of a function header. It caused the file to be Syntactically incorrect and all 8 functions inside of it to fail.,instructor

I'm afraid I have no idea. I don't have access to the test cases. But anyway you can try various values and see for yourself: 3600 + 60 + 1,instructor
"Michelle: I wouldn't say intuitive, but when you know how the interpreter processes code, it kind of make sense. When it reaches a function definition, the body as a whole is evaluated to create the function in memory. So it does not go evaluating each lines one by one. Check out this screenshot of the visualizer: http://i.imm.io/1gkSL.png You can see the previous step that was executed, marked by the blue arrow. Cheers",instructor

"Hi I've taken another look at the quiz because it seems to confuse so much. There is no problem that I can see with the answers of the two last questions. When the red arrow is inside the function body, it's because that function has been called, several lines down the file. And when the arrow is not in the function body, ""result"" does not exist because it is a variable that is local to the function. Does that make sense?

With a capital F. Being an interpreted language, you don't have to perform a compile step when you want to run a program, so you can change your code, and execute it right away.That reduces the chance of modifications to the code not being reflected at execution time, I can't tell you how many times I forgot to recompile a Java or C++ program and didn't immediately understood what I did wrong.The fact that you can use it as a quick and dirty calculator is also most helpful when in the classroom. 2 - Python has a very rich standard library and is easy to use It allows the user to do a great deal of things without always having to rely on third party libraries.It is also ideal to build quick and dirty tools that will make your life easier.I use it (amongst other things) to create the PDF versions of the in-video quizzes each week.I described some parts of the process here. 3 - Python removes the need for the user to constantly worry about resources management Memory allocation is a very important thing to understand when you're a full blown CS major, but for most users that just want to have fun writing small and non-critical programs, this is an added layer of complexity that is not strictly necessary. 4 - Python is beautiful, forces good programming habits onto beginners and the documentation process is supported by its design My personal favorite.There is a lot of cool things in the Python syntax.That makes for easy-to-read code, both for teachers evaluating homework and for students reading example code.The control of the logic flow is done through indentation, and that's very useful, I went into some details about that here. I'm sure there's a lot of other valid reasons to use Python, but those are the main selling points for me, and that's why yes, without a doubt, I would recommend Python over Java for an introductory course. Cheers ",instructor
"Hello, that's normal, you can find out more about it here! Cheers",instructor
"Yes we can! Check here. Also, if you can spare a few minutes, I recommend you take a look at this. Cheers",instructor
"Hello, check this out. And is you have a few minutes you can spare, I recommend reading this. Cheers",instructor
"That said, mastering terminology also helps one understand what other people are talking about. That can be useful when answering questions / reading answers. Would you be interested in a document summarizing the terminology for this course? I might start working on it.",instructor
"Stephen, actually that's not quite how it would go: Nothing inside a function body can be executed after the program flow has reached a return statement. A function always returns one single value, this is true in any programming language that I know of, not only Python. This is the reason why the elif statements are not necessary here. Actually, the last if statement himself is not necessary, you could write:   if scheduled_time == estimated_time:       return 'on time'   if scheduled_time < estimated_time:       return 'delayed'   return 'early' And the function would behave in exactly the same way. There's only three different cases we're concerned about regarding the values of scheduled_time and estimated_time. If we ever reach the second return statement, it's because the first condition was not met, or else the function would have exited at the moment it would have reached the first return statement. And for the same reason, if we ever reach the third return statement, it would mean that the first two conditions checked were not met. Does that make sense? Cheers",instructor
"Oh, and sorry for pointing the 10 stuff out, I jumped to the code without reading everything before when I answered. :x",instructor
"Well, I don't understand it either, in France we don't have hyphens in phone numbers. But then again, those exercises were proposed by a student that took the course the last time, and he said 10 digits in the specs for the function, so I went with it. ^^",instructor
"I like how you approach character validation, it's actually nicer than my attempt. But your code does not check if there is 10 digits in the number, only that there's only digits and hyphens present. I've just added the Exercises Key on the wiki page if you want to check it out.",instructor
"Well, here's (in pseudo code) how I went about it: # get user input# initialize a counter variable (aggregator pattern)# For each char in the input... # If it's not a digit or a hyphen, then... # say the number is not valid # If it's a digit... # increment the counter# Now that each char have been tested, if the counter is at 10, then... # Say the phone number is valid# Say the phone number is not valid",instructor
"Returning a boolean or a string indicating whether the input is valid is very similar, it does not really change the function's logic. The valid_phone_number function is quite more complicated, would you like me to post my key for the two functions? I have been working on it, but I have encountered problems with some functions when trying to solve them without using concepts that were not covered yet, also some questions are seriously lacking in precision.",instructor
"Hey Shannon Maybe you could use the string method: isdigit()? If you want to check every character yourself though, you should check if the character is not in ""1234567890"", and return False when it is, much like in A2 with the is_valid_sequence function.",instructor
"Gulzada, please be mindful of the honor code. It's OK to post code that doesn't work, or hint to an answer. It's not OK to post code that works, or give an answer outright. ",instructor
"Alvaro, the answer is in the A3 FAQ. Cheers",instructor
"Why do I get a OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument when I try to open a file? This is most probably because you're running Windows, and there's backslashes in the file. Try and double each backslash like so: ""C:\\path\\to\\file.txt"" If you don't Python will assume you're escaping characters, much line '\n'.",instructor

Alan: yup next week we tackle files. [Edit: never mind the other stuff: it's proprietary. I'm ashamed to have posted such a link.] [Edit2: this looks better.]Cheers,instructor
"Yeah, input files will be in pure text format, like the starter code for the assignments. Very simple structure too: data in row / column form, separated by spaces or characters like "";"".",instructor
"The official Python 3 doc says both ways are equivalent. But despite the fact that they produce the same result, you should use .append(x) when you know you're gonna insert at the end of the list. It will make the code easier to read, both for you when you come back to it later and for other programmers reading your sources because it's what they would expect to see in such circumstances.",instructor
"Yeah I always do that because I'm a neat freak when it comes to code and I find it's pretty, and square, so very square. <3",instructor
"That's weird, I got the file on the website though. Three of the docstrings were left for us to do, but for the type contracts I used the ones specified in the handout. :o",instructor

"Please do not comment on FAQ posts in this thread: they will be deleted on sight so that FAQ items stays visible. You're free to make your own posts though, as I'll pin FAQ stuff at the beginning. Why is the autograder saying I'm wrong? I've tested the code in IDLE and I get the correct result every time! You are most likely using the print(...) function instead of the return statement to show the results of your functions. If the feedback says something that more or less ""None is not <whatever>"" then go back to your code, and replace every print(...) function call with the appropriate return statements. /!\ Emergency Update /!\ Houston, we have a problem. Python's Syntax is so nice that people tend to use words instead of symbols, thinking it's gonna work out fine. For a few days now, I've noticed an outbreak of people using the is operator in their code. The is operator is the object identity operator, it most likely does NOT behave the way you think it does. If you use it in your code, and you can't figure out why your functions are failing, this is probably the reason. Use the equality == operator instead.",instructor
Are you by any chance printing your result instead of returning it? Cheers,instructor
"Oh yeah, that too! Good catch Anon.",instructor
"That means if you have a sequence with, for example ""E"" inside it reported as valid, then there's a problem too. However, the hints provided probably do not discriminate between a lower case ""c"" and a character like ""E"", it just detects that you have an illegal character somewhere.",instructor
"On that note, I have edited your post to remove the code, because it is too close to the solution and now that I have explained why, it would violate the honor code. :) Cheers",instructor
"Yeah, only uppercases letter are valid. So saying ""atcg"" is a valid sequence is false. Cheers",instructor
You're welcome. (Thanks Anon),instructor
"Hello! I believe the question clearly states: Unlike str.count, you should allow overlapping occurrences of s2.",instructor
"OK, please check Tom's suggestion bellow too.On a side note, I understand that was some crappy illustrative code but still, just in case I would like to point this to you: start, test_1, test_2, final are terrible function names: they don't describe at all what the functions are doing. ",instructor
"(That would make the code look like this:)>>> def test_1(Z, B):... return Z * Z - B... >>> def test_2(X, Z, A):... return X + Z + A... >>> def start(A, B, C):... Z = A + B / C... X = test_1(Z, B)...

"Sorry: no. Your code appears to be mostly correct by the results I'm seeing, so you probably can not post your code without violating the honor code. Maybe you can use the debugger to see why ""None"" is produced by your functions.",instructor
"How about this? def start (A, B, C): Z = A+B/C X = test_1(Z, B) Q = test_2(X, Z, A) print A, B, C, Z, X, Q(Where test_1 and test_2 are the first versions of the functions you proposed.)",instructor
"I can't say for sure, but my guess would be that you are printing the results of your functions, instead of returning them. Cheers",instructor
You should be able to access the feedback for all of your submissions either way. Yes: the best submission is the one that counts. Cheers,instructor
"I agree that printing stuff is a good way to do a quick and dirty debug on some occasions. However, in Python 3, print is a function call, not a statement. :) Cheers",instructor
"Wim, Lori: Have you guys checked out the FAQ thread for A2? I've started working on it today, maybe it will contain some answers regarding the grades you're getting.",instructor
Well in this case maybe this thread could help.,instructor
"I can't give you the answer, and I don't know if the instructors will. However, that may happen, so I suggest you just wait for people to move on the subject. Cheers",instructor
"Anon, please try and not breach the honor code by providing solutions to the graded programming assignments. It's OK to post code that you know don't work It's OK to hint to an answer It's not OK to post working code It's not OK to deliver correct answers outright. Thanks.",instructor
"Also, you should use an other variable as your accumulator, or else you will have nothing to loop over after doing the Assignment Anon suggested. Also, you don't have to rewrite the code to check what character you're looping over and get its complement, you can just reuse the function get_complement. Cheers ",instructor
Are lower case 'atcg' valid characters for nucleotides? No they are not.,instructor
"Is a nucleotide sequence of zero length considered valid?Yes, yes it is.",instructor
"Why does the autograder says All=8; Errors=8; Failures=0; Successes=0; Warnings=0? My code was working before!  The reason for that is probably that the last time you modified your code, you introduced a Syntax Error somewhere in the file.When that happens the autograder cannot use the file at all and therefore all the tests are showing as ""failure"".Try and run your file as a module in IDLE, if there is a SyntaxError somewhere, it won't run and IDLE should highlight the source of the problem. ",instructor
Why does the autograder says 'False' is not false? You are probably returning the string 'False' instead of the value False. Try removing the quotes. Same thing for 'True' is not true.,instructor
"Manu I have edited your post because with the answers below, it became too close to providing the answer for the assignment. Please be mindful of not breaching the honor code. Cheers",instructor
"Yeah, you can't have a return outside of a function body. What you can do however is evaluate the function call: >>> def sum(lhs, rhs):... return lhs + rhs... >>> n_1 = 6>>> n_2 = 7>>> sum(n_1, n_2)13Take a look at the course wiki.

"Oh and by the way, the PDF versions of the video quizzes are on the Video Lectures page, with the other links on the right.",instructor
"Damn, I have no idea. We've noticed problems with the video quizzes that we did not experience the first time the course ran. Example: too big a font size and the code overlaps the answers. It seems this is related to the browser settings, and that the only way to fix it is to change the default font size or something like that. If you are (very) motivated you can think about submitting a bug report for that particular issue. Cheers",instructor
"There is no specific meaning to ""consider this code"". You don't have to interpret it, you just have to read the code. Everything that is before the actual question is there to provide some context. May I ask what question you saw exactly? I'm asking because, when I run the video, I have only one question for that particular quiz, and because I'm responsible for creating the PDF versions of the quizzes, I need to know if I missed a question because of a Video Player issue. The question I see says "" After the code above is executed, what value does y refer to?""",instructor

"The -1 % 24 = 23 bit is due to the mathematical properties of the modulo operator, actually this is one thing to watch for when you start a new programming language: not all language use the same definition of modulo operator.

Step 2 - Choose where to ask If you don't want to ask in English or if you feel like you can express your problem better in your native tongue Consider asking in a language-specific study group.The Arabic Study Group. اذا احتجتم للمساعدة، تعالوا واسألوا هناThe Dutch Study Group. Als je hulp nodig hebt, vraag het hier.The Spanish Study Group. Si necesitas ayuda, preguntanos aquí.The German Study Group. Wenn Ihr Hilfe braucht, fragt uns hier.The Chinese Study Group. 如果有任何問題，歡迎到這裡發問！-- 如果有任何问题，欢迎到这里发问！The French-Speaking Study group. Si vous avez besoin d'aide, venez demander ici !The Russian Study Group. Если вам нужна помощь, задавайте свои вопросы здесь.The Italian Study Group. Se vi serve aiuto, chiedete qui!The Brazilian Study Group. Se você precisa de ajuda, venha e nós pergunte aqui. If you decide to ask in English, choose the right sub-forum. The forums here have a lot of sections and sub-sections, each with its own purpose. If you prefer Facebook, You can also get help on the official Facebook Study Group. Step 3 - Watch out for the special case of the [Platform Problem] If you can determine that your problem is of such nature (because it's obvious, because nobody could help you, because someone told you so, because you tried everything else, etc...), then you don't have a lot of choices left, but if you are very motivated, you can submit a bug report.Here is a real live example of a problem another student encountered in which I explain in detail the process of submitting such a report. Step 4 - Choose a meaningful title that will also help competent people notice the thread It is generally better to start a new thread rather than posting in an existing one, that way your question will be more visible than if you post in a slightly related thread with a lot of comments.If you have a coding problem, then a lot of students will be able to help you, but if your issue appears to be related to your environment (Example: you have trouble installing IDLE) then mentioning the Operating System you use (Windows, OSX, Linux flavor, etc) is a good idea.I am totally useless when it comes to Apple computers, or Windows 8. Step 5 - Describe the issue in details Give some context, explain how you got there.If the problem is related to a video lecture, say which one.If it is a programming issue, then give some code using code blocks.If you're not sure where in the code is the error, give all your code using a pastebin-type website such as the Debian Pastebin. Take care of not breaching the Honor Code when the coding problem concerns the graded Exercises / Assignments. It's OK to post code that you know don't workIt's not OK to post code that worksYou can also think about posting links to screen captures of the bug in action, using a picture hosting site such as imm.io Step 6 - Post your question and check for an answer after 5 minutes The course forum is a very active place.Sometime you will get an answer, or a request for additional details literally in seconds. Step 7 - [The end]: post to say if / when your problem is solved That way people who helped you can move on to helping others.If you started a new thread to post your question, please mark it as resolved.

So have you guys started running programs yet?,instructor
"Next week, you'll be able to start on a small programming assignment. You will have to write code, and then submit it to the coursera platform that will auto-grade it and give you a feedback on the tests your program passed.",instructor
"Absolutely. And for now it's pretty basic, but in a while you're gonna be amazed by what you can do.",instructor
"Yeah, it's the [cc] icon at the bottom right.",instructor
"Thanks! Confirmed, transmitted upstairs. ",instructor
"Well, I've wondered about that too, but I have absolutely no idea how to do that with only Week 2 concepts available... With Week [Edit: 3] concepts I could think of a way to not use the round function, but it seems like a lot of pain for nothing. Congrats on completing A1. :) A2 is coming up in a few hours. ",instructor
"You can still complete E2 until 11:59 AM EDT today and A1 until Sept 11th, same time.",instructor
"And no, it's not possible to run a module without saving it first: it would defeat the very point of writing code inside the module.",instructor
"Yes, I mean this thread indeed. There is also additional exercises and their solutions on the course's Wiki, specifically here. Now, for the graded Exercises: no, you won't get the answers for those. When it's a multiple-choice type question, you can deduce the correct answers from the feedback. However, when it's a question that ask you to type in some code, or a number then you won't get the answers, only hints to the correct answer.",instructor
"I think that depends what you mean by ""run"" and what you mean by ""normal"". May I ask where you saw that statement? ",instructor
"No, it's the Python shell, the one with the >>> prompt in IDLE, but it can look a lot like the DOS shell if you have started only the Python interpreter instead of the IDLE program.",instructor
"Hey Siana, Please note that the hard deadline for A1 is not before Sept 11th. The most up to date information on deadlines for Exercises and Assignments is always available on the corresponding page: ",instructor
"No, you won't be penalized. But beware the program that performs the grading of your submissions takes a certain amount of time to process a file. In low activity periods, you will get your feedback almost instantly, but at rush hour, the 65K+ students in this course can overload the autograder quite a bit. This is why the time delay recommendation is in place. Cheers",instructor
"Hey rosa It is not out of the deadline: A1's hard deadline is on Sept 11th, and there's no penalty for submitting after the due date.",instructor
"Hey Ninaad How about using list comprehension and the zip built-in? >>> a = [10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0]>>> c = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]>>> [str(i) + ' x ^ ' + str(j) for i, j in zip(a, c)]['10.0 x ^ 5', '20.0 x ^ 4', '30.0 x ^ 3', '40.0 x ^ 2', '50.0 x ^ 1']",instructor

No it's not. Hint: there's also underscores in function names.,instructor
"Hey, I edited out the screenshot from your post because it was too close to the actual solution to the question. There is no answer shown in the quiz, your answer is shown twice. I recommend you check the spelling of the functions you used. Cheers",instructor
Hello Have you read this one? Cheers [Edit: and this seems like a good place for this thread.],instructor
"Just assignments, the answers for the exercises can be deduced from the feedback. There's already answer threads for the first two assignments: A1: https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2272 A2: https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2595",instructor
"We'll make a thread for that, but not after the due date. Only after the hard deadline.",instructor
"Can you try and align the expected results under the first chevron of the prompt, like I did in my previous post?",instructor
"Can you guys please test something first? 1. Download a raw version of the starter a3.py code. 2. Submit it. 3. Go to the feedback page, check the score for the last submission. If the score is 1/37, the autograder is working fine. I'm not privy to the inner workings of the course, but if I may ask: where did you find information saying that the UofT grader was used for the HPP course?",instructor
"No, points won't be deducted. The score you see is the score you get. Cheers",instructor
"Common pitfalls: Strings are usually using single quotes for internal representation, the type of quote you use in your examples to describe the returned value has to match. If you have a test like this: >>> get_stuff() ""test""It might cause the automated test to fail, so consult the feedback for a hint that you should use this form instead: >>> get_stuff() 'test'You cannot auto test for functions that prompt user for input.",instructor
"Your function make_str_from_row is not returning anything, but it is printing the result, so its effective return type is NoneType. ",instructor
And it's probably disabled voluntarily to prevent students from injecting completely arbitrary code in the autograder.,instructor
"It's a solution like another, and it's probably better than taking a screenshot. That said the colors are not ""wrong"", they are just different for nearly each text editor out there",instructor
"Hello Anna, can you try this? Cheers",instructor
"Well if you still want an answer (That I won't be able to provide btw, my work here is done.) from the people in this course, it's best if they have everything they need to think on it.",instructor

"Irina, do you have any IDLE window or just the Python Shell? If you have the IDLE window, then use the menu File -> New to show the editing window. The editing window will have the run menu. Cheers",instructor
"And as of now, in the FAQ.",instructor
"How come the result shows 42 / 41 instead of 41 / 41? A new test case was added for Assignment 1You can see this by going into the details of the feedback you received from the autograder: Before: After: If you correctly implemented the function get_hours as per the A1 handout's instructions, you will get the 42th point just by resubmitting your previous work.

Congrats. :),instructor
"That is very weird, you should be able to see it just by clicking on the link. Do you have some kind of error message? Can you take screenshots? Cheers",instructor
I formulated an hypothesis here: https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1044#post-6708,instructor

"Janine: good one. ^^ There is a new test case that is used by the autograder: Before: After:It seems like if you correctly implemented the function get_hours as per the A1 handout's instructions, you will get the 42th point just by resubmitting your previous work.",instructor

"You can take note of what function was tested, and go back on the A1 handout to check if you've followed all the recommendations. Cheers",instructor
"That's normal, you can follow the action here: https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1096",instructor
"It's probably because you used some weird-looking characters instead of quotes signs. Did you type that in a word-processing program? You need a simple text editor to write code, such as IDLE's editor, or NotePad++ if you're running Windows OS. To clarify, your code is like this:def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit): ´´´(number) -> number Return the number of Celsius degrees equivalent to fahrenheit >>> convert_to_celsius(32) 0 >>> convert_to_celsius(212) 100 ´´´ return fahrenheit - 32 * 5 / 9But it should be like this:def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit): '''(number) -> number Return the number of Celsius degrees equivalent to fahrenheit >>> convert_to_celsius(32) 0 >>> convert_to_celsius(212) 100 ''' return fahrenheit - 32 * 5 / 9Cheers",instructor

"Hello You can see the correct answer by downloading the PDF version of the quiz. (on the Video Lecture page) But you can think about it like this: 1. What's the type of arguments passed to the function in the example calls? 2. What's the type of the return value? (hint: it won't ever return a count of 1.5 vowels.) Once you have those two element, you can write the type contract as seen in the videos.",instructor
"Hey Benjamin, did you try what I suggested above?",instructor
"Steven has a solid point. I did not base my speculation on data. I just remember that the last time the course ran, I read communications mentioning that the autograder was overwhelmed. There is supposed to be a 1 hour delay between submissions, even if we haven't seen this being enforced yet. I assume that if such a recommendation is in place, it must mean that the max load the autograder can handle has already been reached in the past, and that limitation was put up from experience. I didn't want to start some kind of debate on what is or is not a DoS, and whether or not that's what we're seeing here. The important part of the message was supposed to be ""There's still one week 'till the hard deadline, no need to panic"".[Edit]: Steven, the submission and the grading process are two different things. UofT is requesting the files from coursera, and doing the grading, before sending back the results.",instructor
"Hello I'm saying I don't know how much time it takes the autograder to query coursera for a file, grade it, and send it back. And as I said, the autograder is most likely reprocessing every file previously submitted by every student. ",instructor
"The code was not changed during the week end. The only thing that's different is that one test case was added, and we know it did not break anything because everything was working fine earlier today, and students were seeing feedback from the new test case. It might be that the autograder is busy retesting every previous submissions with the new test case and is just unable to respond at the moment. If that's the case, the students of the course might be adding to the involuntary DoS by submitting their files over and over again. Let's be patient, try and not submit our files too often, and things should get back to normal soon. Please remember the hard deadline on Assignment 1 is not for another week. Cheers",instructor
"Hi You're not supposed to provide others working code for Exercises or Assignments. Please be mindful of the honor code. As for your question: you do what you want with your assignment, but the Handout recommends a way to complete each function, and it does not mention if statements anywhere. (And that makes sense because if statements are Week 3 material.) Cheers",instructor
"Attila, Do you use Python v2 on your computer? I'm asking because your on-line interpreter uses Python 2.",instructor
Hi There's a few more clicks needed to get to the useful stuff.,instructor
"Hello Renée Python uses indentation to delimit logic blocks inside a program.A function definition is such a logic block: Everything after the function's header that is part of the function must be indented by the exact same amount of whitespaces characters.When you start writing a logic block, you end the first line of that block with a colon :.Every statement coming after a colon and inside the logic block must be properly indented to the right.If the immediately following statement is not indented, the interpreter will raise a SyntaxError. When you break the level of indentation, it tells the Python interpreter that the following instructions are not part of the previous logic block.Because of that, you'll sometime see other SyntaxErrors when you broke the indentation too soon, due to the fact that some statements, such as a return statement, cannot appear outside of the logic block. In about a day, when Week 3 goes live, another kind of logic block will be introduced: the if statement.In the same way we indent the content of function definitions, we'll have to indent the content of the if statement. In a lot of other programing languages, logic blocks are defined by opening and closing sequences, so the indentation of their content is usually not mandatory.Because it's not mandatory, people can feel free to indent in a very irregular manner, and that tends to produce code that is very hard to read. Cheers",instructor
Hello It seems to me like you forgot to enclose the type contract in documentation strings. Cheers,instructor
"Spelling, check your spelling. I've edited out your (mostly correct) code.",instructor
"I've edited out the code from your post because even if unnecessary long, it would probably still work.",instructor
"It seems to me that your proof is based on the assumption: So a sequence complemented twice should give itself. This does not work for empty string [...]Why does it not work for the empty string? The empty string has no nucleotide, so its complement is itself. Because its complement is itself, its complement's complement is also itself. It does not breach the 1-1 relationship between a nucleotide and its complement. ",instructor
"No biggie, everyone but Pr. Warren from RICE university forgets the colon once in a while.",instructor

Hi Please read the A2 FAQ.,instructor
It's pretty verbose already.Your function is returning the string 'Not a valid nucleotide' when it should in fact return the string 'T'.,instructor
"HelloI've edited out your get_complementary_sequence code because it's mostly correct.Now, the problem's root is in your code for get_complement.You're using the object identity operator is, and it does not behave the way you think.I recommend you stick to the material that was covered in the course.Cheers ",instructor
"Why are you using the object identity is operator?We haven't seen it in the course material, it does not behave the way you think. ",instructor
"Anon, I've edited out you mostly correct code for insert sequence because with JP's comment it became too close to giving the answer.",instructor
"You have a spelling mistake: it's complement, not compliment.I have edited out your (mostly correct) code.Cheers ",instructor
I just submitted four times in under five minutes: no problem.,instructor
"No, it means that you don't have to wait for an hour between each submissions. Previously, the platform enforced a one-hour delay during which students could not upload their source code for automatic grading.",instructor
"The autograder expects your function to be spelled complement, not compliment.I've edited out your (mostly correct) code. ",instructor

"HelloThis is most likely because your Windows didn't start the correct program. I recommend you try this, or search around the forums for people with similar issues that have found a way to make Windows behave. Cheers",instructor
"I think our beloved instructors have split the concepts because they didn't want to overload the students with stuff like immutability and so on. On a side note I suspect a tuple is also more efficient because of the way they are implemented. A list is a re-sizable array of references, so it must be less efficient from the memory point of view.",instructor
"Hmm, a tuple is still a single object. Now, your solution is perfectly fine too and also more efficient, but I decided to go with the Week 5 concept rather than the Week 7 concept, because we'll reach it sooner and because there was already a lot of parenthesis in the code.>>> def permute(x, y):... return [y, x]... >>> x = 5>>> y = 9>>> x, y = permute(x, y)>>> x9>>> y5",instructor
"And if I may continue with the analogy, the buildins are the core components that you will always have at your disposal. In a car that would be for example: The brakes, the steering wheel, the windshield, etc. We'll see in Week 3 that like a car, Python comes with several options, such as the Math module. ",instructor
"Hello This is because nothing in a function body can be executed after you reach a return statement. Now, there is a solution to your problem, but just so you know, it relies on a concept we'll see in Week 5: the lists of values. Try this:>>> def quad_formula(a, b, c):... return [(-b + ((b ** 2) - 4 * a * c) ** 1 / 2) / 2 * a,... (-b - ((b ** 2) - 4 * a * c) ** 1 / 2) / 2 * a]... >>> quad_formula(1, 3, 7)[-6.25, 3.25]",instructor

"Hello! Can you open a Terminal (it should be in your list of programs something with a rectangular mostly back icon.) then type in ""python3"" or if you have an error, ""python"" and show us the result of that command? Cheers",instructor
"Indeed, this is what functions are for.",instructor
"When you assign a variable to another, it's not the address of the variable that becomes the value for the new variable, but instead it's the value referred to by the first variable. Here's an illustrative snippet: >>> Tree = 4>>> hex(id(Tree)) # Tree contains that address'0x8bb9e0'>>> Forest = 7>>> hex(id(Forest)) # Forest contains that address'0x8bba40'>>> Forest = Tree>>> hex(id(Forest)) # Now Forest contains the address that that was previously in 'Tree''0x8bb9e0'>>> Forest4>>> Tree = 8>>> Forest4",instructor
"Hi That's normal, the execution of the code you save in a new file will not show on the shell when you restart. However it will be executed and any name defined during that execution will then be available in your shell. You can then use the functions you defined in the new file in the shell. You can test that with the following steps: Close IDLE after saving your work.Start IDLE, and then go to the menu File -> Open and select your file. It will open in a new window.In the new window, use the menu Run -> Run module You can now use the functions defined in the file in the shell.",instructor

"Hello You can find the answers for the in-videos quizzes on the Video Lectures page: there's a series of icons on the right of each video, those are links to various resources, including PDF versions of the in-video quizzes, with the answers. For the graded exercises however, I don't know if the correct answers will be given, and I think that it is unlikely. About your other question: the function print's return value is None, so it won't change anything if you add a return keyword before, because the function already returns None when there is no value explicitly returned with a return statement.",instructor

"I found the math module if you're still curious: it's a standard library module that's written in C. If you want, download the Python source here, extract it to a folder and then you can find it in \Modules\ : ouroumov@Adcap:~/Desktop/LTP/Python_Source$ find . | grep mathmodule./Python-3.3.2/Modules/cmathmodule.c./Python-3.3.2/Modules/mathmodule.c",instructor

"Hey Bradley, I answered to your other post, but for the math module part. It was an interesting question so I took a look on my computer: ouroumov@Adcap:/$ find . -type f -name math.py* 2> /dev/null./usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/xdiagnose/utils/math.py./usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xdiagnose/utils/math.pyc./usr/share/pyshared/xdiagnose/utils/math.pyouroumov@Adcap:/$ That might be different under Windows, but can you see if the \dist-packages\xdiagnose\utils\ subfolder exists in your Python folder? Cheers[Edit: Hmf, it appears that's but a fraction of the math module, I have no idea where the rest of it is stored.]",instructor
"Hi Bradley Using Python visualizer off-line is possible, but just so you know, it is quite painful to set up. Basically, you have to install a web server that will serve local http requests and run the Visualizer inside it. There's also a less painful way to set up a visualizer, with Google app engine, but it uses Python 2, not Python 3. Still, it can still be useful to watch frames unfold on the stack, but if you rely on it for arithmetic, you better make this your bible. Anyway, if you feel motivated, take a look here. Now about the path thing, I'm not a Windows expert, but maybe you can find an answer here. If I were in your shoes, I'd try either this, or the following statements in the shell: import syssys.path.append(""C:\\path\\to\\the\\folder"")(Note the escaped (doubled) backslashes.) I hope that'll do the trick. Cheers",instructor
"Colette, did you find a solution?",instructor
"I have no idea, this is a very weird one. Have you tried to run your code in IDLE as a module to see if the syntax is valid? If you want I can post about this problem on the staff forum.",instructor
"Yin, Try using two underscores on both sides of __name__ and __main__ . Cheers",instructor
"And you can use a function, indeed: >>> def fizzBuzz(n):... for i in range(1, n + 1):... # Do stuff here... And remember from the lectures, you can concatenate two strings together:>>> string = 'some '>>> string = string + ""stuff"">>> string'some stuff'",instructor
What you can do is drop your code on a pastebin-type website like http://paste.debian.net that way people can look at it if they want but won't accidentally stumble upon it. You can decide what programming language's syntax you want to highlight (Python 3) and how long your code stays online.Cheers,instructor
"That's how you exit a logic block in Python: you break indentation to return to the previous indentation level. Here, the previous indentation level was the one inside the function's body, where the if keyword was placed. For the same reason, you can write multiple function definition in a given file, by breaking indentation and returning to the first character on the left of the line, thus exiting the function's body.",instructor
"Hey David Can't tell you about that, I can't even remember if the answers were eventually given the first time the course ran. For Step 3, it's actually two operators. That or you can reuse the function from Step 2 to get the difference in seconds, then work out the corresponding number of hours from that. Cheers",instructor

"Well, we haven't heard from Denise this week. If she comes around and give links to her PDFs, we'll pin them as usual, however we won't make them ourselves. Cheers",instructor
"Hey Anon What you can do is try this: Here's an example call for the function seconds_difference in Step 2: >>> seconds_difference(3600.0, 1800.0)-1800.0 This is the example call that's written inside the documentation string in the file a1.pyDo this in IDLE: >>> time_1 = 3600.0>>> time_2 = 1800.0 Now, you have two variables, each with a value, and it's the same values they would have in the function during the example call. Then, go back to the Week 1 videos about Python as a calculator, and the videos about Variables. You can try and combining those variables into expressions, using the arithmetic operators from the Python as a calculator video. Example: >>> time_1 + time_25400.0 time_1 + time_2 is an expression, and it is evaluated when you press enter as the value 5400.0. Now, there's other operators available, including the minus - operator. Try and use it instead of plus, and see what result you get. Try different orders for the variables, with different operators, like time_2 + time_1, and so on. When you get an expression that evaluates to -1800.0 (the result of the function call in the example) then you'll most likely have the correct expression for the function. Then, go back to your a1.py file, and write a return statement for the function, right under the documentation string, and with the same indentation as the documentation string (so 4 spaces character on the left of the keyword return). On the right of the keyword return, leave a space then write the expression you found that evaluates to -1800.0. Then, save the file using either the menu or CTRL + S. Next, either use Run -> Run module or copy all the code for the function seconds_difference by selecting it then using CTRL + C, and paste it into IDLE using CTRL + V, then hit enter until you get back the prompt >>>.  Once that's done, go back to your file, and copy an example call, then paste it into IDLE, and check that it returns the correct value according to the Examples. Do that for each example call in the documentation string. When that's done and you got the right value each time, go to the Assignment page, click the Submit button on the bottom-right. Using the dialog that opens, select your file a1.py, and make sure that is the correct file that you modified. Then, click Open, and then Submit again. When that's done, go back to the Assignment page, and click the ""View"" button at the bottom right, and you should see that your function seconds_difference passed some tests, and got you some points. Then, go back to your code, and re-read the instructions about the function from the handout, read again the function description from the documentation string, and understand why the code you wrote make sense. Then, you should be able to go to Step 3.",instructor

"Hello Dimitar Disclaimer: /!\ most of what follows will make no sense to most beginners reading this thread. /!\ I'm gonna try and answers those questions the best I can, but sadly I'm not a C expert, so pardon me if that doesn't do the trick. 1) In Python you can consider every variable to be a pointer to a value. Variables have no type, but values do. You can consider every variable to be the Python equivalent of a (void *) type pointer in C. 2) In Python a function can return different kinds of values depending on what happens inside the function's body. Those built-in functions are implemented so that it returns the correct kind of value: >>> max(1.2, 2.4)2.4>>> max(1, 2)2>>> max(1.3, 2)2>>> max(1, 2.3)2.3 3) Unused memory locations are collected when deemed appropriate (Check out Kevin's link or this one.)

"doctest is a standard Python module. (We'll see modules next week.) It is used to test the examples you write in the documentation strings for a function. __name__ is a variable that is automatically set and is equal to '__main__' only when you execute a module, not when you import it from another module. This might be obscure, but next week's videos will help you understand the module stuff somewhat. Cheers",instructor

"I see a lot of people struggling with Assignment 1 and pasting the raw feedback summary over and over again. This post is to explain that the feedback is not only there to tell you that something failed, but also what failed, and how. If you don't see well enough the screenshots, copy the image address by right clicking and choosing the correct option in the contextual menu, then paste it in the address bar in a new tab. I made some modifications to my personal a1.py file in order to make it fail some tests and illustrate my point, please excuse my poor editing skills: To get to the Feedback, click on the view button: You're gonna see the awful stuff that people enjoy posting on the forums because they think that it contains meaningful information.However, here's the kicker: that's not all there is to it!On that page, please direct your attention to the ""mid-summaries"" link. And then click it. This will show you a more detailed version of the feedback.When considering the next screenshot, please note that every function that you are supposed to write is assigned a series of tests, referred to as ""test_<function name>"". Here, you can see that two of my functions failed: seconds_difference and hours_difference.I only introduced one error in my code. I'm gonna let you speculate but at that point it's pretty fair to assume that one function failing caused the other one to fail.This is specific to the code I wrote for the Assignment, and it does not mean that if your function seconds_diff fails, your function hours_diff should fail too. Now hey, we're well on our way to having a clue about what went wrong!Now is the time to get slammed in the face by the overwhelming amount of informations you get when clicking the ""Details"" link on the top right corner of the table. Brace yourself: this is rough! As you can see, for each function a number of different tests is executed.In that particular case, it seems that all the tests in the docstrings are run, and then some. Now you can get even more information by clicking on the ""FAILURE"" link on the right of each test report.You'll get something like this: This gives you somewhat human-readable information about what was tested and what went wrong. For the story, I introduced a random * 0.999 in my code to derail the calculation that the grader performed. The value on the right '12.1654etc..' is what my function returned, and the value on the left is what was expected. Now, if you followed the Handout's recommendations and submitted your completed steps as you went, you should be able to get a grip on what's going on, or at least where the problem is. I hope this will be useful to some of you.I will update this post with a second example in a while.Cheers ",instructor

"Shoguns!Thanks a lot for signing up! Following is the game plan I've been thinking about for the Guild, it is open to discussion so don't hesitate if you have other helpful ideas: Stuff you can do without having to write anything: 1 - Upvote helpful posts you notice in the forums. An helpful post is one who guides the person asking a question to the answer while not introducing concepts he doesn't know yet.This will encourage helpers to help more.There is only a handful of reason why you would ever need to downvote anyone, please be careful to not downvote people expressing their own point of view, even if it does not help or totally misses the point. Stuff you can do that needs actual keyboard action: 0 - Be careful not to breach the honor code when you answer a question Hint to the answer, help the student reach it by himself. 1 - When you answer a question, watch out for cases where people obviously never read this thread or are asking questions that are already answered in the FAQ. When you encounter such a case, invite the person asking the question to take a look at those threads (try and be nice about it), and if he is asking about a specific FAQ item, provide him with a link to that specific item. (You can link to individual posts / comments - the link is on the right of the poster's id) This will help educate your fellow students on the best practice when asking for help, and will reduce the probability that such questions from the same student appear in the weeks to come. 2 - If you know of a link to a specific thread where a question is discussed at length feel free to direct the student asking about that subject to that thread. 3 - When you actually have to answer the question yourself, format it nicely. Use code blocks for code or shell snippets, use bold text for important words, etc... 4 - If you feel like it, you can go back on your posts when you know they helped and sign those with a link to this thread. Example: Anon - The Guild This will recursively help us recruit more members. Stuff you can do if you can come on the IRC channel: Drop me a line in private when needed. 1 - Hunt down FAQ items. We are currently late in setting up the Week 2 FAQ. We'll start working on it but any help is welcomed. 2 - If you stumble upon Honor Code violations, alert us so we can edit the posts. If I'm not connected or afk, you can alert nitish` or d4vey if you see them. The guidelines about posting code samples or attempted answers for the Exercises or Assignments are as follow: If someone posts an answer / code that he knows is right, then that's a problem and you can alert us / notify the poster. If someone posts an answer / code that is wrong, then that's not a problem. If someone posts an answer / code that he think is wrong but isn't, that's a problem too and you can alert us / notify the poster. If someone, after seeing a wrong answer, posts some helpful advice without giving the answer such as ""Please, be careful what operator you choose to use"", that's not a problem. If someone, after seeing a wrong answer, posts something like ""Just replace '/' with '//' and that's right"" then that's a problem too and you should either alert us or notify the poster.   I know this is a fuzzy line, but please use your best judgment.

">>> 3 - - 36>>> This is because of the Operator Precedence. Positive, negative have highest precedence. When the arithmetic expression is scanned, the python grammar stipulates that it can be of the forms:a_expr ::= m_expr | a_expr ""+"" m_expr | a_expr ""-"" m_exprThe matching case is the one on the right because the first two tokens that the interpretor scanned are ""3"" and ""-"".When the scan starts on the m_expr on the right, the set of rules is:m_expr ::= u_expr | m_expr ""*"" u_expr | m_expr ""//"" u_expr | m_expr ""/"" u_expr | m_expr ""%"" u_exprWe are then entering the first case because the first item scanned is a ""-"", so none of the other case match.Finally, we're encountering the rules for a u_expr:u_expr ::= power | ""-"" u_expr | ""+"" u_expr | ""~"" u_exprSide note: see how we're deeper in the grammar? This is why the unary ""-"" has higher precedence than the binary ""-"".We're entering the second case of that grammar snippet because the first token is still ""-"", and what's on it's left must be another u_expr.The second time around the only choice is the first one because none of the other possible first tokens are on the input stream.And the rule becomes...power ::= primary [""**"" u_expr]There's a few more steps involved, but the point is, the expression is valid Python syntax. Side note: when there is no way to process the input stream using the Python grammar, that's when a SyntaxError is raised.For those that didn't run away and that are still interested, I recommend Pr.

"Hello It's good that you're playing around with Python and please, keep on doing that. :) Technically, your code does not stick perfectly to the design recipe, there's three things I'd like to point out: The actual return type of your function is NoneType, because it prints the result, without returning it.Because of the previous point, the docstring's description is a bit inacurate. You don't need to enclose your colon separators in parenthesis, but you can add spaces after each comma to enhance readability. Have you watched the Week 3 videos yet? If you did, then you can now rewrite the function so that it sticks closer to what you wanted in the first place. :)",instructor

"Tammy: I'd like to help, but I don't really see how to recreate the ""Quizz"" experience using a .pdf file. Can you maybe post an example of such document from the other courses?",instructor
"Yes, spacing is extremely important. Not because your code will cease to function if you don't space correctly, but because it increases readability, so it will help other people read your code, and it will help you read your code when you come back after a vacation or whatever.",instructor
No they are not. They just help assimilate the material as you go.,instructor
"Yeah you have to use the import command. Write your definitions in a file named ""modulename.py""cd to the directory where you created that file.Start the interpreter with the command ""python3""type `import modulename ` (note there is no .py)Now you can call modulename.fu()    alternatively if you want to be able to call it with fu(), change the import line like this:from modulename import *",instructor
"It's not a problem, it just says you attempted the embedded Quizz in the video, you don't have to worry about that.",instructor
"Hint: for that kind of question you usually don't need to change a lot of stuff. Here try and obtain the result just by adding parenthesis where necessary to achieve the requested order. Don't move numbers around, etc... There is an infinite number of ways to achieve the same result, but the Quizz cannot be easily set up to recognize all valid patterns.",instructor
"Ok, I made a crude fix if you want: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/c8875128/ I'm gonna post in the TA forums to signal this issue and try to have the subtitle file updated. Cheers",instructor
Yes it is.,instructor
"Just checked: no, me too. I'm using SMPlayer on Ubuntu 12.10 and I can delay the subtitles as needed using shortcut keys though, maybe your player has a similar function?",instructor
"Brad, I've just restarted my computer to boot Windows 7 and check it out. The installation process was uneventful, it went like this: Download the x86-64 version. (64 bits)Launch .msiSelect ""for all users""Next / Next / NextYes, authorize.FinishTo answer your question: it probably won't make a difference. Install the x86-64 version if your computer is less than 10 years old.",instructor
You just need to add parenthesis where needed to achieve the desired result. Do not move numbers around.,instructor
"You have to exit python2 before starting python3. Type ctrl+d or ""exit()"", then type ""python3""",instructor
Because the value a refers to changes on the third instruction.,instructor
"You don't really have to use it, or bother with it. It's just a component you need to install if you want to be able to use IDLE. And if you're curious... Tk is a graphical toolkit that was originally developed as an extension of a programming language named 'Tcl' (pronounce 'Tickle'). You can use Tk to easily build Graphical User Interfaces. Because it's awesome it has been ported to a number of other programming languages, including Python. The IDLE program uses that toolkit for its GUI.",instructor
"OK Still, do you have some kind of text editor? ",instructor
You should not have to run the interpreter in super user mode. Do your raspberry runs in graphical desktop mode?,instructor
"The survey is not part of your final grade, don't worry. The course logistic is detailed here: https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/wiki/view?page=courselogistics",instructor
Less cheesy: http://xkcd.com/992/,instructor
"Same here, cannot reproduce.",instructor
Balasubramaniyan Sugavanam: did you download the x86 package? (if you're using a 32-bits OS you cannot use the x86-64 version.),instructor
"The easiest way to understand that function is to play around in interactive mode:>>> round(2.5)2>>> round(0.123456789)0>>> round(0.123456789, 1)0.1>>> round(0.123456789, 3)0.123",instructor
"Hello, This problem is specific to the OS / Browser / Video player you are using. I have no such problem using the HTML5 player under FireFox running on Ubuntu 12.10",instructor
"Because when evaluating the expression z = x + y it goes like this: x is evaluated to 2, y is evaluated to 3, 2 + 3 is evaluated to 5 5 is stored in memory somewhere z is made to point to the address where 5 is stored.",instructor
The first exercise is UP. =),instructor
"Don't worry about it. This is not part of the grade, it's just a platform thing.",instructor
That's because there is another incorrect expression in that Quizz. :),instructor
"Yes, there is an extra closing parenthesis in the first expression, hence the SyntaxError. You can just try each expression in the Python shell in order to find out which ones are incorrect. ",instructor
"You can use both versions anyway. I'm running Ubuntu as well and I use both Python 2 and Python 3, no conflict here.",instructor
That's because 'builtins' has two underscores before and after: >>> dir(__builtins__),instructor

"About the captions:This one is out of my hands, but I've passed on the messageAbout not resetting the environmentYou can use the import command we saw in Week 3 to do that - that way you won't replace the names already defined.The glossary can be found here: https://share.coursera.org/wiki/index.php/LTP:GlossaryFor additional practice, check the ""Recommended Readings"" thread in the forumI did not understand the question about the visualizer, did you find your answer since?",instructor
"I actually reported your previous thread on the CTA board yesterday. Along with 5 other threads. I guess nobody had the time to get back to you yet. Now that I think about it, I should have told you so on the other thread indeed. Well, beginner's mistake. Still, the main issue you reported (regarding the Captions) is not something that we CTA can fix, a request for recaption has to be raised with Coursera. For the other things, most of your answers are already in the forums / in the wiki / in the lecture notes of each videos. Cheers",instructor
Hey Linda = is the assignment operator. == is the comparison operator. Cheers,instructor
"Thanks. Confirmed, reported.",instructor
"And to clarify, four times is not necessary, you could use just one space, or two spaces, you just have to keep using the same number of prefix spaces if you have several lines of code in your def block.",instructor
No I mean: >>> def square_return(num):... <Hit space four times here>return num ** 2,instructor
"In that window, you should be able to start idle by typing in import idlelib.idle Still, that's weird, the space thing should have done the trick: >>> def square_return(num):... return num ** 2... >>> square_return(4)16",instructor
That's actually a better idea than mine. (the first one) It uses only already-seen concepts. Thanks Tom,instructor
"There's also a more elegant way to bypass this using a string method, but it uses concepts we haven's seen yet. Nevertheless, if you want you can check this out. ",instructor
You're never requested to open the file yourself. The file passed as an argument to the function is already opened. So you can go ahead and use those methods on it directly. Cheers,instructor

We do the wetwork. (see below),instructor
"As Anon said: 3 hours, 1 attempt. If it's the same kind of exam as last year, then you can expect something like an Exercise, but longer.",instructor
The answer to that question is in the first post of this thread.,instructor
We're still waiting on you guys to tell us whether or not you've read the A2 FAQ. Cheers,instructor
The answer to your question is in the A2 FAQ.,instructor

"Well, here's a hint: It's easier to check if a character is not in a set of allowed characters, than to check if a character is in a set of non-allowed characters.",instructor
"I've edited my previous comment because it was a bit rude in retrospect. Please excuse me, there's just a whole lot of people that are absolutely convinced that it's the autograder's fault, until they realize it's not. That said, bugs do happen, so I shouldn't rush to conclusion.",instructor
"[Edit: sorry. I was rude there.]Have you tried something like this?is_valid_sequence(""ACTG!"")",instructor
"HiIsn't the value 28, instead of 20?Cheers ",instructor
"If you can find me on IRC I can take a look at it. (I'm there between disconnections under the nickname ""ouroumov"") But first, you should check the detailed feedback from the autograder and see if it detects your latest submission based on the timestamp for each report.",instructor

"Well, we don't have exactly a well defined structure to do that. Jonathan Lung is in charge of the autograder so he can usually take a look at student's submissions, but that's all. Nevertheless, if you can find your way onto IRC, you may catch me between disconnections due to my cr4££ý Wifi under the handle ""ouroumov"" and then I or another CTA that feels like it can take a look. However, we will still just hint to the answer, not give them outright. Cheers",instructor
"Anon, I'm gonna link to this thread on the staff forum, and hopefully someone will get back to you.",instructor
And have you read the A2 FAQ?,instructor
"Well, you still have two attempts to find out. :)",instructor
"I've relayed OP's request to the course staff (actually, more like three identical requests by other students), let's wait and see what happens. ",instructor
"Does <X> function needs to handle <Y>-types input? You can usually tell by the way the handout phrases the description of the function: From is_valid_sequence:The parameter is a potential DNA sequence. That means that the inputed sequences will have to be checked. From insert_sequence: The first two parameters are DNA sequences and the third parameter is an index.  That means you can assume only valid sequences will be passed, and that the index will be an actual integer.Try and keep it simple.",instructor
"I'm gonna relay those multiple requests for exercises keys on the staff forum, but until you hear from someone that's in a position to give you an informed answer (Instructors, official course staff) please refrain from posting code.",instructor
"Him. The handout reads: The first two parameters are DNA sequences and the third parameter is an index. As a general guideline, when a parameter is described with such definitive terminology (are, is) then you can assume that yes, the value passed will be valid.So no: you don't have to handle special cases here.",instructor
"Suparna, There is no actual ""book"" module. You have to assume there is one, even if that's not the case. Check Anon's excellent advice above. ",instructor
"Rachel, your code only checks the first character in the sequence, and then returns immediately without checking the other characters. ",instructor
"VLC should be fine. If the .srt file is not in the same directory, as David suggested, you can just move it to the same directory your video is in, or drag and drop the sub file on the playing video.",instructor
"If I may: You're actually checking only the first character of the string, each time you call the function, and immediately returning from the function without checking the other characters. ",instructor
"The question reads:Your answer must be a single expression that does not use square brackets (string indexing and slicing), and you can only call method str.find and use the arithmetic operators (+, -, etc.).That explains why the first too answers are wrong. Extra hint: you don't need to use str.find's third parameter.",instructor
"Take a second look at the video ""More str operators"", around 01:29. That function's body can be written in a single line of code. Cheers",instructor
"This exercise is about function reuse and how to apply a function to every characters in a string. A good example of a very similar use case is the implementation of the encryption step of a shift cipher. A shift cipher works by replacing each character in the input string by the character obtained if the first character is shifted by a number of places. So for example, ""A"" becomes ""B"" with a shift of 1. A shift cipher with a constant shift key of 1 could be implemented like this: def shift_one(char): ''' (str) -> str Returns the character obtained by shifting char one time to the right. >>> shift_one('A') 'B' >>> shift_one('B') 'C' ''' # Get the number corresponding to the character, add 1 to it, # and returns the character corresponding to that new number. return chr(ord(char) + 1)def get_encrypted_message(message): ''' (str) -> str Returns an encrypted version of message obtained by shifting every character one place to the right. >>> get_encrypted_message(""AB"") 'BC' >>> get_encrypted_message(""BC"") 'CD' ''' output = '' # Initialize the accumulator variable. for char in message: # For every character in message... output = output + shift_one(char) # ...add the shifted char to output. return output # When every char was added, return the result. >>> get_encrypted_message(""This is a test!"")'Uijt!jt!b!uftu""'Now, for the get_complementary_sequence code, instead of the shift_one function, you would be using the get_complementary function.",instructor
"I have relayed those numerous requests for exercises keys to the course staff. Let's wait and see what they think about it. It might take a while though, because they are very busy at the moment.",instructor
"Hey Anon Take a second look at the video str indexing and slicing, you will find a good way to do that at the end of the video. Cheers",instructor
"You probably have a syntax error somewhere in your file, have you tried running it in IDLE? I've removed your code because it's mostly correct. Please take a few minutes to read the A2 FAQ. Cheers",instructor
"It's a time in hours. But this is a question about an Assignment, not an exercise, be careful to post in the right forum next time. :)",instructor
">>> score = [0]>>> score[0]>>> def update_score(list, number):... list[0] = list[0] + number... >>> update_score(score, +7)>>> score[7]>>> update_score(score, -3)>>> score[4]Something like that.",instructor
"May I ask why you guys are sticking to such an historical version of the Caesar's Cipher? It certainly made sense at the time because Mr. Caesar did not have a handy tool such as ord() at his disposal and the only ordered sequence he could use was the letter sequence, but if you forget that limitation you can do something that's a little bit harder to decrypt and more fun too: >>> def caesar_encrypt(msg, key = 5):... '''(str, int)-> str... ... Return an encrypted version of message msg using a caesar-like cipher with... a shift dependant on the key and the length of the string.... ... Precondition: key is in the (arbitrary) range [O, 255]... ... '''... return ''.join([chr(ord(char) + key + len(msg) % key) for char in msg])... >>> def caesar_decrypt(msg, key = 5):... '''(str, int)-> str... ... Return an decrypted version of message msg using a caesar-like cipher with... a reverse shift dependant on the key and the length of the string.... ... Precondition: key is in the (arbitrary) range [O, 255]... ...

"Haha, thanks. I'm not sure what we can do about it though. This seems like a minor problem compared to the other stuff we have going on. =)I'm leaving this thread unresolved in case somebody has time to correct that later on.Cheers",instructor
"Well, that depends on your Operating System. ie: If you are using the last version of Ubuntu then you already have it.",instructor
"Hey, thanks for sharing! Maybe you can change this thread so that it would be for articles what This One is for websites and documents? Cheers.",instructor
"Hello, Try again with the X86-64 version of the installer. This is weird because the file is of type .msi, this is a windows installer file you're not supposed to be able to open, you should just be able to execute it. ",instructor
"Sorry, but I don't understand your question. You might want to take a look at those guidelines. Cheers",instructor
If that's the case you should probably avoid uninstalling it. It is probably a core component for other programs.,instructor

"I can't speak for the instructors, but I can tell you what we experienced in the last run of the course: Students taking LTP:1 are of a wide, very wide range of level when it comes to programming, and even computers in general. The slow paced approach allows absolute beginners to grasp what experienced programmer had to learn the hard way. The fact that they have a full week to complete a segment that only has a couple hours worth of video allows them to assimilate over time and to be able to trust the insight they previously gained when a new week starts. It also allows the staff to dedicate more time to helping the students on the forums. Busy people (workers, IRL students) can also stick with the program while going on about their business. The general goal here is to try and not loose anyone on the way. Of course it's impossible, but there's no harm in trying.",instructor
Thanks. 8) Glad I could help.,instructor
"Hello, I see, I'll take that into consideration for the next times. Thanks.",instructor
"Hello, Can you give us some screen shots? Cheers",instructor
"Hello, No you _are_ supposed to use the second window to write code. The reason it has a ""run module"" menu is because the code you write there is basically copy/pasted into the shell window. The shell window has no run menu, that's normal. If you don't like IDLE, this thread explains another way you can follow the course work.",instructor
"You're welcome, let me know if you need help adjusting. Cheers",instructor
"Ok, well you posted in the right section so your bug report should be crawling his way up the food chain as we speak. The process can be quite long, but don't worry about it. If it is not fixed in a week, post again in this thread and I will propagate the issue to the CTA forums. ",instructor

Yes -- Python can't represent the number 0.1 exactly. That should be fine.,instructor
"Passing test cases (not even ours) is never any guarantee that everything is perfect since the test cases may be incomplete, but it's always a reassuring sign!",instructor

"Hi Linda,You state that your function works in IDLE; what is the other way that you are running it? Do you mean that you're running the driver in one case and using the shell in the other? If that's the case, do you have two a3.py files on your computer by any chance? The driver needs to be in the same directory as the a3.py file you are editing for it to work.",instructor
"Hi Kurtis,The first line of your first submission wasfrom tkinter.filedialog import askopenfile",instructor
"The problem, now that I look more carefully, is, as you say, that you had a print statement; that's a Python 2 feature! Python 3, which we are using in this course, no longer has a print statement; it only has a print function.",instructor
"That was a real head-scratcher (took me about twenty minutes to figure this out). Use ""=="" for comparing strings, not ""is"". This is due to differences in the way the Python memory manager (to handle variables) works between Python 3.3 and earlier versions of Python 3.",instructor
The file that Coursera tells us you submitted does contain a syntax error; perhaps you submitted the wrong version of a file.,instructor
You can receive a compliment for passing the complete complement of tests on complementary nucleotides. And someone might even complement that compliment with a complimentary beverage!,instructor
"If you click for more details on the test cases, you can see what error occurred. Etienne is right -- in both cases (Abdelmotaleb and Ramon), your code is failing due to a syntax error.",instructor
"This is correct. As long as your function behaves correctly (using any extra functions you defined in your submission, if necessary), you'll get credit for it. The automarker does not care how your function determines the answer (so long as it does it in a fairly timely fashion).",instructor
"I haven't looked at your submission, but here's something you might want to think about: def my_function(): for ch in ""are there any numbers in this 1 string?"": return ch in '1234567890' Why does this function not return True?",instructor
The time zone in the report you see is in Eastern Standard Time. I think the one you see in Coursera's list of submissions is in your local timezone.,instructor
"The mark you get back when submitting your assignment is your assignment mark. Nice and simple :)Yes, the grading process is actually handled by the University of Toronto, not by Coursera.",instructor
Your assignment mark is the highest mark you obtained. You'll need to look at individual submissions to look at their scores.,instructor
Hi; we expect the labels to be black. Could you please post a screenshot if what you're seeing? Thanks!,instructor
"It looks like the grading program was occasionally grading the previous submission, but I think we fixed it on Monday. To look at your current mark, you can see how many tests have passed in your most recent submission (assuming everything is working properly on our end). Please let us know immediately if you're getting all tests passing on new submissions without having finished the assignment!",instructor
It looks like your most recent two submissions were not edited in IDLE; they were unsuccessful.,instructor
"Your <code>get_minutes</code> and <code>get_seconds</code> could be simplified, but otherwise it looks good.",instructor
"We intentionally did not show you the expected return value of, for example time_from_utc(+0, 12.0)",instructor
"José's answer is what the automarker (and Python) are complaining about. If you try to run the code on your own computer before submitting, Python should also complain about the indentation. Remember to test your code before submitting!",instructor
Tip: If you do something like this: def func1(): # ... your function definitions here #And then at the end of your file If __name__ == '__main__': import tkinter # whatever testing code you want the automarker won't run the code inside the if-block and it won't be a problem.,instructor
"It looks like the example files are all on one line.Well, that's not really a question, but it's true that on Windows you may need to use a text editor other than Notepad to view the sample files. Opening the file in IDLE should work just fine.",instructor
"If you write the function def print_x(): print(x) And call the function in a fresh shell you will get an error because x is not defined either inside the function or outside. However, if you run something in the shell like x = 5 before you call the function, you won't get an error. That's one reason why you might be getting an error from the automarker but not during testing.",instructor
"If you check the automarker feedback, you'll notice that it's complaining that you used print somewhere in your main code and won't mark anything else until that's fixed. Also, your code did change between your submission that got 0 and the one that got 5. It wasn't the same code.",instructor
"Hi Samyukta,I've just updated the FAQ to answer your question: https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2443 . Hopefully that helps!",instructor
"Why am I getting ERROR: DisabledModuleError Use of the sys module is not permitted. without importing sys? You're probably importing tkinter which in turn import sys. If you want to import tkinter for testing, put that inside your main block. See https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2844 for more details.",instructor
"Hi Rodrigo,I'm sorry the exercises and assignments have been confusing. We do spend hours in groups slaving over small changes in wording (in case you thought we just slapped things together). What part of the docstring did you find confusing that the other docstring clarified (in this particular instance)? The main difference I see is that the description of the board appears in the docstring. In this instance, we wouldn't change the docstring; what constitutes a board appears at the top of the file and it would be extremely odd to repeat the same information in every single docstring that a board is referenced (also, what happens if the specification of the board changes? That's a lot of hunting through code to make a change). If the problem was that the description of a board at the top of the file did not specifically mention ""single characters"", this is something we could do to improve our docstring.As for the example, because there's file input/output involved, we don't write examples for it (as per the function design recipe). This has to do with limitations of doctesting (if you've encountered this).",instructor
We use different input test cases than the ones in the starter code.,instructor
"Consider the time 133. The number of seconds should be 13. If you use integer division by 60, you get 2.Consider the time 133 * 60 or 133 * 60 + 3600. The number of minutes should be 13 (and the number of seconds should be 0).",instructor
"Every few seconds, we have a program (written in Python, no less) check Coursera for submissions. We call your functions and compare your functions' return values to the expected ones and assign a grade, sending it back to Coursera.",instructor
"I think we've resolved it, but please let me know if you're still running into problems!",instructor
"Just like, in our normal math system, we cannot express all the digits of 1/3 as a decimal number (without using extra notation), the normal representation of computers is unable to perfectly represent 13/7. And just like we often round, the computer also rounds. However, the computer uses a different base than we do (slightly different way of representing numbers) which means that sometimes the computer needs to round even if we don't, leading to surprising answers like the result of 0.1 * 3.",instructor
"Python compares strings in the same order as you'd find in a dictionary (for example, ""bobcat"" appears before ""meerkat"" in a dictionary, so ""bobcat"" < ""meerkat""). The exception is that an uppercase character always appears BEFORE lowercase equivalents. For example, ""Zebra"" appears before ""apple"" (or any other word that starts with a lowercase character).",instructor
"We chose IDLE because it already comes with Python and thus everyone can follow along with the same software. As a Mac user, I personally use TextWrangler for most of my editing!",instructor
Are you getting an error message of some sort while trying to download?,instructor
"Perhaps manually creating the .idlerc directory will help. To do so, in the terminal (not the Python shell), try this:mkdir ~/.idlerc",instructor
Yes! The only text files I don't edit on a Mac with TextWrangler are LaTeX files and a few files I edit through vi/nano (and I edit a lot of different kinds of text files).,instructor
"Here's a suggestion: Try figuring out the total number of minutes since midnight, first. Then figure out how to get it to a number between 0 and 59.",instructor

"First, make sure you're not using Internet Explorer (it doesn't save our files correctly). Use another browser like Firefox to access the course website instead. Next, right click on the link to a1.py from https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/assignment/view?assignment_id=11 and save the file to your desktop as a1.py. Next, start Idle. Go to the File menu and click open. Find a1.py on your desktop and open the file. You should be able to click Run Module from the Run menu without any errors. If you enter to_24_hour_clock(36) in the shell, you should see the answer 12.",instructor

"Hi Bradley,Just checking in... do you see the correct mark on your assignments now?",instructor
It looks like you've got some syntax errors with indentation; maybe this thread will help: https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=622 (and the post by Jeffrey D. Long),instructor
"Hi Bradley, that's the same mark I see and it is correct. You're done assignment 1!",instructor
"You have five pieces of feedback waiting for you from the last few days; the marking program checks for new submissions every five seconds. If you haven't already, please read the assignment 1 instructions that we updated over the weekend with detailed steps for checking your feedback.",instructor
"Hi Erika! It looks like you've left some comments to yourself outside of the docstrings. Your functions should look like this: def my_func(x): '''(int) -> x Return blah blah blah. >>> my_func(9) 9''' return x not like this: def my_func(x): '''(int) -> x Return blah blah blah. >>> my_func(9) 9''' Me: >>> return x You should be able to run your code in Python by clicking Run -> Run Module as a quick test. If running the module on your computer doesn't work, we won't be able to grade it, either.",instructor
TK got renamed in Python 3 to make it follow naming standard Python naming conventions.,instructor
The automarker says you successfully returned a NoneType but you didn't modify the score list (either correctly or incorrectly).,instructor
"Hi Anne,That's the expected behaviour of our automarker. The automarker tries to run each test function that we have written. Each test function tries to run your program -- and then fails due to a syntax error (which is why none of them can run). Unfortunately, it does repeat the same thing several times.",instructor
"When you start Python or IDLE, the version number is in the first line displayed. Alternately, inside Python, __import__('sys').version",instructor
"Looks like you're using Python 2 instead of Python 3. If you have multiple version of Python installed, you'll need to make sure you start the right one.",instructor
I think this was a problem that occurred during the regrading we did last weekend.,instructor
Unfortunately we won't be posting solutions since we might reuse the assignments in the future.,instructor
"Exactly right about the precondition not being checked by Python. Just because a precondition is included doesn't mean a function won't behave in a reasonable way for input that doesn't meet the preconditions. We didn't want you worrying about how certain operations in Python behave with negative numbers when it came to us running our test cases. If you don't want to call your function with a negative number, you can easily change the inputs to your function -- note that shifting by -1 hour is the same as shifting by 23 hours (or by 47 hours).",instructor
"It appears as if some things aren't displaying properly if you click ""Details"" -- if you click ""all"", you should see your successes.",instructor
"Sounds like you're doing all the right things (trying both versions of the installer and trying a different browser)!If you're having problems with the version 3.3.2 installation file, the version 3.2.5 installation file at http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2.5/ might work. Or you might have better luck with 3.0.1 http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0.1/ which was released before Windows 8, so it might be better tested with Windows 7. All the material we cover in this course should be equally applicable to all Python 3.x, so as long as you stay away from Python 1 and Python 2, you'll be fine. Let us know if you're still having problems!",instructor
Anton is exactly right. You'll definitely want Python 3 since Python 2 differs in subtle but important ways.,instructor
"Hi! Are you having problems with the IDLE editor that comes with Python? If IDLE doesn't work, Notepad++, as suggested by Anton, will work, but there will be some differences that you'll need to be aware of (unfortunately, not being a Windows user, I don't know what those differences are).",instructor
"Tom is right; each assignment is marked in isolation. Normally, we can give you friendly feedback for each test, but there are few things that cause the marker to abort entirely, like running out of memory from a function calling itself, we're unable to give you any precise feedback.",instructor
"I like that example, Tom :)",instructor
That's beyond the scope of this course.,instructor
"Remember that a variable defined in a function only exists inside that function. Here's one way of helping a variable ""escape"": def func(x): result = y * y return result def func2(x): print(""x is "" + str(x)) r = func(5) func2(r)",instructor
One of our test cases gave you a board and asked if a word was in it. The word is not actually in the board. Your function return None instead of False.,instructor
I'm not quite sure what you mean; do you mean calling one is_valid_sequence from inside get_complementary_sequence? That shouldn't pose a problem for the automarker.,instructor
"I see four submissions from you; I don't see get_complementary_sequence until your third and fourth submissions, both of which got 24/24. I'm not sure what the problem is.",instructor
Hi! I just looked at your submission -- your get_seconds(3800) returns 200. Are you sure you submitted the right file?,instructor
Hi there! It looks like your solutions works in Python 2. We are using Python 3 for this course.,instructor
"It probably says that it might harm your system. The assignment file is perfectly benign! If you're using Chromium, you can just click ""keep"" to keep the file, anyway.",instructor
"Hi Shridevi,It's nothing to worry about. Good work on your assignment! We made a change to the marking scheme over the weekend; more details are posted at https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/class/index .",instructor
I just checked your submission. Your function correctly returns 0.00 for those inputs.,instructor
"Hi Karen,The automarker is currently working fine. The files we are getting from you are empty, however. Please make sure you are submitting the correct file and submitting to the correct place: Coursera provides two slots for submitting files when you submit your assignment -- one is the ""code submission"" field and the other is the ""additional submission"" field. Make sure you are using the ""code submission"" field.",instructor
"Hi Daniel,In addition to the example inputs, we test your code against other (""secret"") inputs. The examples are just that -- examples -- to show other programmers how to call the function and to help clarify some common situations. However, the text description of the function is also important. You should definitely keep trying assignment 1 until you get 42/41. Etienne made a great post at https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1027 showing how to get more details about your submission.",instructor
Emily is right; the test result here actually means that the expected value is 9 but a 105 was returned and not that 105 was expected but 9 was returned.,instructor
"(The following is just a for-fun explanation)The mathematical operator modulo can be either negative OR positive for negative numbers. For example, it is correct to say that -11 modulo 10 is both -1 or 9 (-11 is either -2 * 10 with 9 left over or -1 * 10 with -1 left over). For some purposes, it's more convenient to have a negative number and for others, a positive number. Different programming languages have settled on different ways of treating negative numbers; Python has chosen the always-positive route.",instructor
"Akshat, see the FAQ on is/==.",instructor
"The grading system will be running for quite some time after the assignment deadline (I think we only took down the one from our previous offering a month or so before this offering started), even though you won't receive any credit.",instructor
I just checked; your second and third submissions are not the same (four lines were removed and 8 new lines were added). Perhaps you forgot to save or submitted the wrong file?,instructor
"Thanks, Tom; you've been extremely helpful on the course forum and your other answers have always been spot on so I didn't realize it was a matter of keeping your response simple! I didn't want anyone to have the impression that print and return are interchangeable, though. :)",instructor
"If you check the feedback for your assignment, you'll note that there are syntax errors in your submission. Please see the FAQ for more details.",instructor
"Actually, it's not that the automarker doesn't recognize print (in fact, we specifically added code to the automarker to check for unexpected output since print and return are entirely different beasts). It's just that for a course like this, you're always writing functions that return a value, so print would be incorrect.",instructor
"Etienne is exactly right. Exec is also disabled, for that matter.",instructor
The error message details should tell you what you need to change.,instructor
"I don't see any submissions on Coursera from you; perhaps this is a web browser issue. Could you please try submitting with, say, Firefox?",instructor

"Just in case there was any confusion, the marking system only checks to see if each function behaves as specified in the assignment handout; it's actually possible to submit terrible code that will pass the tests. The system only checks for functional correctness. In the classes we teach in person, we do some automated marking and usually the code that passes is pretty good. Every once in a while, though, someone submits a solution that passes that is either utterly brilliant or very baffling. Last term, I got a 100-line solution for a function that calculated what century a given year was in.",instructor

"Automatic grader feedbackI have a SyntaxError. What does that mean?A Error: SyntaxError occurs when a program does not follow Python's grammar (syntax). For example, an if statement missing a colon at the end of the line is a problem. If you get this error, we were unable to run any tests on your code. To fix this error, make sure you run your program before submitting and deal with all the error messages from Python. I have a Failure: AssertionError . What does that mean? This means that your function, when called with certain input, returned the incorrect answer. To reduce the likelihood of this error, make sure to test each of your functions carefully with your own input.",instructor

I'd recommend others do something similar if they find themselves in the same position as I was..However, I would never say that people should put aside their background knowledge or stay silent when they see what may be an error of semantics in specification, etc.I think that part of my point that I didn't state explicitly is that clearly one can raise the issue (or this kind of issue) precisely because one has an 'understanding' of what 'their definition' (i.e the Professors', the client's, etc.) of something is.",instructor

"These kinds of issues that you seem to be having are common enough for people trying to learn programming, especially the 'understood it last week, don't understand it now' experience & the emotional reaction to that. So, feel good that all this trouble will be worth it in the end. =D.Now, my own brief explanation of a return statement: all functions are either called directly by you or by other functions. If called directly by you, it will return a value (which can, in fact, rather weirdly, be 'None'... think of 'None' as 'none of the other return values out there') to you. Yet, how do you directly call a function? For us, it's effectively always on IDLE, so what is returned to you is returned to you on the next line of IDLE, & the way IDLE displays that return on the next line of IDLE is by printing it... unless what's being returned is 'None', which doesn't get printed.If a function is not directly called by you (most won't be, you will find as you write more programs), it must have been called by another function... so function_1 calls function_2... & so function_2, when it completes, must return to function_1 (just as if it was returning to you directly, as if you had called it). What function_2 returns to function_1 is what is that return value.Now, function_1 will have been written by you (or someone else) to expect certain kinds of things to be returned & not others... the kind of thing is what we talk about when we talk about 'type'. If function_1 calls function_2 to read the temperature off your local newspaper's website, function_1 will expect function_2 to return a number, most likely a float. If function_1 is actually adding that temperature onto all the other temperatures of the past month to work out an 'average temperature over the past month', then you can see why function_1 will face problems if function_2 returns 'sunny' instead of a number.When we are talking about return values, we are essentially talking about considering how to make sure that no function_1 expecting a number from function_2 gets 'sunny' instead... A function can, amazingly, return another function... but I will only talk about that if you tell me that you've found any of the above helpful.I hope it helps, I'm not sure it will, but I hope it does.",instructor

"This is a great discussion, but I wanted to point out that we haven't covered lists yet. For those who were feeling a little lost trying to follow this code, we'll cover this in detail in couple of weeks. For those interested in the concept of two variables referring to the same object, that is called aliasing and it is a topic that we'll cover soon too.",instructor
"A parameter is a variable that appears between the parentheses in a function header, and an argument is an expression that appears between the parentheses of a function call.>>> def area(base, height): # <-- Here, base and height are parameters.... return base * height / 2... >>> h = 4>>> area(3, h) # <-- Here, area is called with the arguments 3 and h.6.0",instructor

"In addition to the video on installing Python, you may find this Resources webpage helpful: https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/wiki/view?page=Resources",instructor
Fixed! It may take a few minutes more the change to be viewable.,instructor
"Yes, exercise 7 and the final exam will have the same ""soft"" and ""hard"" deadlines. The ""soft"" deadline can be thought of as a suggested deadline and the hard deadline is the one after which no more submissions will be accepted. For this course, there is no difference in terms of your grade between the two deadlines.",instructor
"We intend to use the maximum score, so I'll update the assignment description to reflect that.",instructor
"When watching the videos online, the quizzes are part of the video. You should see a little yellow line in the video timeline and at that point the video will pause and the quiz question will appear. If you download the mp4, you will not see the quiz questions.",instructor
"Nail, buying the book is completely optional. The original version can still be of use, if you know the differences between Python 2 and 3. This link may help:http://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.htmlIn addition to the version change, the 2nd edition also contains new material, such as the Function Design Recipe and the rest of the book has been revised as well.",instructor
"With the way that Coursera handles quiz questions, the font size and layout of the quizzes is dependent on your browser (for example, Firefox, Safari, etc) settings. If you have your font size set to a large font, then the layout gets messy and overlaps. Unfortunately, we aren't able to do anything to prevent that from happening. If the quiz items overlaps, try reducing your font size. ",instructor

I believe you'll see a countdown clock that shows you how much time is remaining.,instructor
This wasn't intentional and it is now fixed. Thanks for letting us know!,instructor
No problem! I totally understand and don't mind you asking at all. :-),instructor
"Thanks for pointing that out. It's fixed.As Etienne suggested, it is possible to use a list, but it's also possible to solve this problem with only the concepts we've covered so far in the course and the book. The fix that I applied was replacing this line:total = sum(grade1, grade2, grade3, grade4)with this line:total = grade1 + grade2 + grade3 + grade4",instructor

"Leticia, you mentioned questions 3-6. Those questions ask for the value the variable refers to. For example, the answer might be something like 12, as opposed to the word integer. Does that help?",instructor

I think it is quite unlikely that this feature will be added in time for use in this course.,instructor
" The rules for executing a return statement: Evaluate the expression. This produces a memory address. Pass back that memory address to the caller. Exit the function. Notice that last part of step 2: ""Exit the function."" As part of the execution of the first return statement, the function exits, so the second return statement is not reached and isn't executed.

"Nancy, you cannot assume that the community TAs are experts.When I took this Learn To Program class the first time it was offered, I had zero prior programming experience except for playing around with my Commodore 64 as a ten year old kid. I am now 38 and have not programmed ever as an adult. However, I caught on really well to the material Jen and Paul presented, and I felt it was an excellent course. I did very well in the course, and I helped people such as yourself on the forums, and was thrilled to be asked back as a Community TA.Community TAs on Coursera are just students who have done exceptionally well in a previous offering of the course. I do not eat, sleep and breathe programs. I doubt that Adrian does either, however, I don't know his background. So please know that we are just trying to help you all, without posting answers or getting too close, due to the very strict Honor Code.=) Jen",instructor
"This is perhaps the best explanation so far I've seen of this question, Gerrit!The two defined functions count_vowels( ) and count_consonants( ) are the ones you need to call in your new function, count_letters( ). If you add them together, you will get the number of letters in (word).Now, the question is how exactly do you add two functions together inside a third function.That's what you need to figure out.",instructor
"Absolutely, I think you've found the answer as posted below. None (with a capital N) is defined as a type in Python, but none (all lower) is not, so it doesn't know what you're doing when you are trying to define x = none.",instructor
"The difference between Question 5 and Question 6 is the behavior of this line:>>> instructor_location = announce_location('Canada')In Question 5, it simply stores something in memory and doesn't produce any output.In Question 6, it prints 'Canada' to the console.So, the question is, what would you put into the body of the function to cause this difference in behavior?",instructor
"Jonny's got it right, it's part of the escape sequence. It doesn't behave like normal characters do.",instructor
"Hi, Doaa, I was able to duplicate the same problem you're having on my iPad. I was able to work around it though, by putting the keyboard pane down, and then back up, and then it types fine. I had it happen several times, because every time I scrolled up to see the text of the question, it would happen again. However, I was able to complete the answer by the keyboard pane down/back up trick. I hope this helps you. :) Jen",instructor
The assignments (so far) are exactly the same as they were in the first course offering. I'm hoping they've tweaked a few things for later on...,instructor
"Nick's got it. Also, Alt-P should give you the most recent command. :) Jen",instructor
"Sometimes the available choices are chosen from an answer bank, so we might have not gotten the same choices.However, of the available answers I get, only one of them will fully satisfy the requirements of the question.You have to carefully watch the ifs and elifs to make sure that the code will be evaluated as you want it to. Some of them have indentations which will cause differences in the way the code is evaluated, and some of them don't properly evaluate both grades.This question requires careful inspection of the code, for sure. But as far as I can see, there's nothing wrong with the answers or the grader.=) Jen",instructor
"If you look at the discussion sections under questions 14, 15, and 16, certainly not everyone thought it was an easy concept.=) Jen",instructor
"Adrian, I like it. Thanks for a very helpful post! I think a lot of people will appreciate that clarification.=) Jen",instructor
"Glad you figured it out, Dawn!",instructor
"Scott, you are on the right track, but Nick and Tom are right. You need to make it one line, and your index needs to be advanced. They've given you lots of tips there. Try again and good luck. =) Jen",instructor
"This thread is supposed to be about Question 4. Please stop posting Question 9 comments in this thread.Jeff - the question is about using indexing. Your solution, while it may work, does not answer the question. There are many, many ways to do things in programming, but in an educational setting such as this, it's too hard to set up an automatic grader that would take every possible solution. It's important to remember that the instructors are trying to teach you something, so we must read the question carefully.That said, you are way overcomplicating the answer. The solution is much simpler than the answer you have given.And to EVERYONE: PLEASE be aware of the Honor Code and do not post code in the forum, especially answers to the quiz.

"From what I can see, after you defined the function, you tried to call the function before returning back to the shell. You got a Syntax Error, and tried again. But, because of this, the function wasn't yet defined.Try it again, but this time, after defining the function, press Enter again until you return to the shell prompt, indicated by >>>. I think you'll find that it works this time.=) Jen",instructor

"Hi Anonymous...I don't know which part you're having trouble with, as you haven't specified. But here are some general tips for this question:Make sure you're writing an expression, not a return statement. Which means, just the expression part, like for examplea + bas opposed to a return statement, likereturn a + bAlso, the expression makes use of the given functionslonger()andget_capital()Therefore, if you were to hypothetically uselonger(abcdefg, bcdef)it will return'abcdefg'and if you were to useget_capital(USA)it will return'Washington, DC'Combining these two functions should return the expression that you need.I hope this helps.=) Jen",instructor
"Yes, it does print the word Canada without the quotes, I was just using quotes in my writing, but I can see how that's confusing.To answer your question, though, the reason it prints it without quotes... think about this:>>> x = ""abc"" >>> x 'abc' >>> print(x) abcHope that helps.=) Jen",instructor

Comes preloaded with software that works great with Unix: SVN, PHP, Apache2, etc. I find a Unix filesystem so much more comfortable to use in development. Great UI - In my humble opinion, you can't beat the usability of a Mac. I love the Mac-specific apps I use daily - Mail, Adium, Textmate Great OS - Can't beat the install of (most) Applications - drag and drop. The /Library folder is well organized and easy to find what I need if I have to dig into preferences, copy an application's support files, install a new Preference Pane. Speaking of System Preferences - another great feature of Mac. Great support for other apps - IntelliJ IDEA is as good on a Mac as anywhere. Skype. Chrome. Firefox. Adobe suite.

This is a very good explanation! A true terminal lets you interact directly with the operating system of the computer. An IDLE window is just a piece of software that sits on top of the operating system. It just doesn't use a pointer or icons. It's called a Command Line Environment (or Interface) rather than a Graphical User one. That's it's only similarity with a terminal.,leader

That would be three falses, so the end result would be false. answer 2 was ""the student passed at least one of the courses."" That would mean at least one thing is true, so the or would be true too.answer 3 was ""the student passed all of the courses."" Maybe they didn't, maybe they only passed two. True+true+false. It would give a true result, but it's not necessary to get all three to work with an or. So you don't need to tick that box.answer 4 was ""the student passed some but not all of the courses."" Maybe they did, making true+true+true, which would give a true for an or, but it is not essential to have all three. Remember only one would do. So you don't have to tick this box either.",leader
"yes, that's right, if you are using or, then true+false+true is true. It only needs one thing to be true. It's the and that needs everything to be true.",leader
" Case#1 math=60, bio=20, cs=30, the Boolean expression will be True. (one pass) - only if it is an or you are evaluating. It won't be true for an and.if Case#2 math=60, bio=70, cs=30, the Boolean expression will be True also. (two passed) - same as case#1. Only works with or.if Case#3 math=60, bio=70, cs=80, the Boolean expression will be True also. (all passed) - this will be true for both and and or.",leader
"""The student passed all of the courses"" is false if maths and cs are true, but bio is false.""The student passed some but not all of the courses"" is also false, because they might have passed all three.The only correct solution is ""the student passed at least one of the courses"".For the and, the only true output is true+true+trueFor the or, which is what we are discussing, the only false output is false+false+false. Everything else equates to true. ",leader
"It might be an idea to ""start again"" with a file you know that works. I would save your own file with a different name, and download the A1.py again. Then just cut and paste your stuff into the fresh A1, being very careful not to disturb the indentations or quotemarks! And keep running it as you go along, so you can spot exactly where it falls over. That might be quicker than continuing to wade through it, looking for an error that is not obvious.",leader
"Thanks Frank, that might be even quicker than my ""solution""!",leader
Oh dear. What does the error message say?,leader
">= and <= are not assignment statements. They are used for making comparisons. The longhand is -is the maths grade equal to or more than 50? same for the the bio and cs grades too. Each of these will evaluate to either true, or false.So you will end up with three trues, or three falses, or a combination of trues and falses.Now look at the logical operator. Is it and or or?The and needs all three things to be true.The or needs at least one of them to be true. (But not none of them. It needs at least one.)",leader

"I was just explaining stacks today to some of my engineering students, who code in assembler and could not be called experienced programmers by anybody's standards (they are a nice group and do try very hard, though).in assembler, you mostly have to move values about between registers. Let's say you added two numbers, and the answer is in the AH register. You want to output the answer to the screen, but the graphics card also uses the AH register. If you try to output anything, you will end up overwriting the answer.So you ""push"" the answer, in AH, onto the stack, to keep it safe. You then use the AH register to do the display bit. Then you ""pop"" the stack to bring back the answer, and carry on from where you left off.You can have many items in the stack but they always go on top of each other, and are removed again in a LIFO (last in, first out) order. You can't change the order of things once they are on a stack. If you try to remove an item from an already empty stack, you get an underflow. If you haven't allowed enough room for your stack at the start, it can overflow (everything just dumps and crashes and you usually get the Blue Screen Of Death). And experienced programmers do quite often use tools like the visualiser to step through code, but they are usually called debugging tools. They are not always separate from the main development interface, sometimes it's just a step-through option, but it's the same sort of thing. It enables you to run your code a line at a time so you can see exactly where it falls over.",leader

They you come in with out reading more then a few comments, and decide we are all a bunch of idiots and we should bow to your infinite knowledge of English and Python, statistics, mathematics and mountaineering. So if you wish to start throwing insults and continue to talk down to every one that shares a different opinion then you, then we can continue on that path.If you wish to start throwing insults and continue to talk down to every one that shares a differing opinion to yours, then we can continue on that path.First, why don't you read some (or maybe all) of the posts before you jump in with your foot in your mouth, it is oblivious you did not read more then one or two post and then decided to jump in and show your lack of understanding of the discussion  Second, if you are going to join in, offer a smart counter proposal, try not to bring up subject as examples that you also do not know anything about. For the record a range in mathematics does have meaning and in statistics the range would not refer to 9, I am not an expert on statistics, but if I remember correctly it has to do with the size of the smallest data set, and in this case it can not be 9, since the only data set is size 10, and yes in geology and mountaineering a mountain range is different then in python, but we are not talking about any of those subjects now are we. Third, all the words between ""Absolutely"" and ""issue"" do not constitute a ""Typo"", thiis is a tiepoFourth, there is no alternative interpretation of the English phrase ""1 through 10"" it is 1 through 10, not 0 through 9, it is a misstatement or they intended to use other code, either way the word do not match the code, but I said that 2 days ago look at the post below this one. That was even before you came in here and opened your mouth and started talking gibberish about 0 is 1, 2 is 1 and 2Fifth, Do not tell another student to go else where, you are no one in a position to tell someone else to go anywhere.Because someone is smarter then you does not mean they are trying to make anyone fell bad you little man. Your petty insecurities, have no place here as no one here will coddle you and tell you lies about you being the smartest one in the room. Every time you open your mouth you prove you still have a lot to learn. So maybe you should try to learn from the conversation instead of thinking you know everything, instead of only proving otherwise.Now you can say that people are being arrogant and condescending. I will point out that it may also be rude and insulting at points. So if you do not like being talked to this way, do not talk to me or any one else here in this manner.

"Your the one to talk about the greater good and ""Derogatory Comments"", Any one that has made a statement in contradiction to your own opinion has only received sarcastic responses telling them why they are wrong and you are right. Your response to Barry is a good example. To start with, most of us DID read your original post, and Barry is right, all you are doing is whining, you are not doing anything to ""Further The Greater Good"", read your points, most are just selfish demands that make the false assumption that you speak for the majority and that you (not someone teaching the course) knows better then the course instructors and staff what it takes to teach a course to 65,000+ people at the same time. Lets walk through a few of your reasons list in your original post Point 1 If someone makes a mistake then they should not have to wait. Why, it is their mistake, your or someone else has no more rights to use the resources than anyone else. So why should the person that makes a mistake be granted more access then anyone else. Point 2 On a ""Whim"" the instructors imposed this limit. Really. So the instructors pulled a number out of thin air and made it a rule.ar·bi·trar·y   based on random choice or personal whim, rather than any reason or system.In case you didn't know the definition. Point 3A lack of feedback is frustrating.You have access to the forum, the python visualizer, the idle debugger, and the internet, yet the auto-grader is your only option.Point 4From an educational standpoint, the instructors and their resources should be at my full dispose. When in your real life did you goto class, get an assignment, do a small part of it, hand it in to the instructor, get it right back corrected for only what you did, and get to do it all over again until you are finished. This is totally unrealistic thinking.Point 5 Quote ""A sizable proportion of the students will want (or feel that they need) the validation of the grader at each step along the way. You're not letting them do that in a practical manner. It shouldn't matter to you what the anxiety level of each student is."" end quoteYes lets say that something is important in one sentence and then in the very next contradict your own argumentbut non the less, you can not give everyone what they want, or fell they want, logistics prevents this. But as said before they have access to the forum, the python visualizer, the idle debugger, and the internet. Point 6 No need to go over this one, since we all know that like most of your other points, you posted with out any knowledge of the subject.point 7many / most / all of the students are busy people with other things going on besides waiting an hour to resubmit.So you think that you have to sit there in front of the computer with that page open and wait.No, someone should have told you that you can do other things, like work on you code, visit the forum and get some help with your errors, watch something on tv, get up and go outside, all the other things you need to do in life.point 8 Quote ""Eighth, fixing problems is often an iterative process. Introducing a long delay is not only not teaching good debugging skills (yes, I know that you want students to test in IDLE, but I'm talking about the problems introduced in the grade submission process) because it doesn't mirror reality, but students will lose focus and thereby the thread of what it is they were trying to fix. That's not educationally-friendly. For most but the very dedicated, they will also lose the joy of the early wins of Hello World programming and instead associate programming with excruciating delays and just give up on programming altogether. The opposite of your Intent, I would assume."" end quoteThis Would suggest that you have a doctorate in psychology, and another in teaching programming skills. This point is just arrogantPoint 9Quote ""save all of us the grief of someone (or thousands of someones) trying to submit close to the deadline and being told that they have to wait an hour to resubmit something when there is less than an hour before deadline. The fora(e?) will become overloaded with pleas of forbearance because ""it's not my fault"" - and other than leaving things to the last hour (which is their right), they'd be right. The fault for them not being able to submit would be yours."" end quoteThis is the only point you have made that carries any weight. Although you make the argument poorly, because you talk about someones right to wait till the last minute. If they know about the submission time limit then they should take that into account when they submit. Procrastinating until the last minute may be their choice, but that also makes it their choice to possibly fail that assignment, making it their own fault if they do so. So a poorly argument and a sad attempt to place blame on someone other then someone acting irresponsible with their time.I would have appealed to the fact the approaching the deadline a portion of the students that are struggling with the assignment might run in to trouble and that removing the limit shortly ahead of the deadline (maybe a few hours, maybe a day) would be a benefit to those students. Point 10 is a joke so I will leave it at that.But if you are serious about ""The Greater Good"" then maybe you should start contributing in some other part of the forum. Share some knowledge with your fellow students that are making posts asking for help understanding the problems. Do something real.

"a lot of people are making this one harder then it needs to be, but there is a trick (kind of a trick), you just need to think in 2Dcreateing a temp variable is just creating a variable to hold the accumulated word and we create it and set it to an empty stringexample a = """"the loop is nothing fancy, refer to for loops video in week 4, the loop with out range and len methods.examplefor variable in str: # instead of a str loop over a list bodythe body of the loop is where we need to think in 2D, here we use that temp variable we created and use it to concatenate all the character that make up a column into a string, think week 2, and for the 2D part str: indexing and slicing from week 4, each row in the board has one character from the column in it, and it is in the same index in every rowlook at the lecture note at this examplehttps://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/programming1/lecture_summaries%2Fweek4%2Findexing.htmls = ""Learn to Program""The first character of the string is at index 0 and can be accessed using this bracket notation:>>> s[0]'L'>>> s[1]'e'for our problem think of indexes as columns, or column_indexs1 = 'qaz's2 = 'gbt's3 = 'dce's1[1]as2[1]bs3[1]ccreate a temp variable temp = """"now think of a list with these words in itlst = ['qaz', 'gbt', 'dce']and use a for loop on the list in the body concatenate all in character at index 1 of every item in the listfor item in lst: temp = temp + item[1]print(temp)abcindex 1 can be any valid index and you could return the temp variable instead of printing itsee we only used concepts up to week 4 to do this problemjust because you have information from the later week does not mean that you need to use it when solving a problemthink simple first, then add your newer knowledge if you need to, but always start with the simplest first,remember back to week 1, and ask if I can use something to solve a problemthen the same for week 2, and then week 3, etc... stopping when you find your answer, and when you do find that answer don't keep looking past where you find your answer, that will only make things harder,look above we can solve this problem with only using information upto week 4, so using week 5 and week 6 information like len and range only make it harder.a piece of advice in programming is use the old 'KISS principle"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principleand python can remind you of this if you want it to, open a shell and type ""import this"" without the quotes and press enter",leader

"It´s a part from an exercise I saw in my degree (Biology) it´s quite Complex to write it in Python. But the main idea is, if we have several numbers (like a, b, c, d, e, integer numbers), describe a function which compares them, take the highest numbers and do the average. This is what I tried.>>> def average (a, b, c, d): return ( max (a, b, c, d) + I don´t know how to continue ) / 2I´m using a, b, c, d, e because I don´t know a priori which number is the highest, so the computer has to do it for me, I saw you can write ""if"" and ""not"", but, how to use this commands? xD This was the reason why I said I should start with something easier.Do you mean the 2 highest numbers as your partial formula would suggest?if so that is easy to dofirst create a list of the valuesvalues = [894,21,876,2,87,36,5564,82,23,1,0,777]then we sort the list, python makes that easyvalues.sort()now all we need is the last to items in the listhighest_2 = values[-2:]add them together with another handy built in function and divide by 2average = sum(highest_2) / 2and to put it all in a handy functionvalues = [894,21,876,2,87,36,5564,82,23,1,0,777]def average(values): values.sort() return sum(values[-2:])/2call it like this print(average(values))",leader
"def fibonacci(n): if n == 0 or n == 1: return 0 if n == 0 else 1 else: return (fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)) Iteras = int(input(""enter number of iterations: "")) for a in range(iteras): print(fibonacci(first + a)) recursion",leader
"I put the numbers in a list, then sorted the list (lowest to highest) and then just returned the first index for the lowest and the last index for the highest.",leader

Can you give me some more info or direct me to a source which describes distinction between shell and a new python window clearly.This is one of the things I don't like about this course, the use of idle, but I do see why they did it.look at the a3.py file, is a collection of functions. and then the a3_driver.py lets show an exampleyour on windowsopen a cmd windowcan cd to your python folder where your python folder cd \python33I don't know how your path is set up so I will make some assumptions from you above posts so we will work in the python33 directoryopen notepad, not idle or word, notepad, lets keep it simpleto startcreate a new file, pick a name any name for now but give it a .py extension and save it to the \python33 directoryon the save dialog look at the bottom, see Encoding, set that to UTF-8and save the blank file, okay that will save use some time later and now I know the encoding will be correctnow lets write our scritpfile = open('README.TXT', 'r')for line in file: print(line)file.close()print('that was the complete file printed line by line')for a in range(10): print('\n')print('that was just to move the text up')file = open('README.TXT', 'r')print(file.readline())file.readline()file.readline()print(file.readline())print('4 lines that read but only 2 print')save thatthat readme.txt should already be in that directory unless you deleted italso in that directory is python.exenow go pack to the cmd windows that I had you openyou are in that directortype diryou will see a list of all the files an you should see the file you just created, the readme.txt, and python.exe. and a few others too.for now the 3 I mentioned are all we neednow in the cmd type this command and press enterpython yourFileNameHere.pyafter you press enter you will see a lot of text flash across the screen, and then you will be back at the promptnow lets look at that text and the code we just wrote file = open('README.TXT', 'r')for line in file: print(line)file.close()print('that was the complete file printed line by line')that printed every thing in the filefor a in range(10): print('\n')print('that was just to move the text up 10 blank lines')as the last print says just printing 10 blank linesfile = open('README.TXT', 'r')print(file.readline())file.readline()file.readline()print(file.readline())print('4 lines that read but only 2 print')now this is answering some of your questionthere are 4 line that are read from the filebut only 2 are printedif you open the readme.txt file you see that the first 4 lines areThis is Python version 3.3.2============================Copyright (c) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011,now this was an over simple example but this is how python really workspython.exe is the python interpreter an that is where your programs (scripts) runand it will only do what you tell it to do, you do not tell it to print, it will not printyou tell it to read a line in the file, it reads the line and that is it.to access the interpreter type python and press enterthat is a python shell just like in idle but with out idle and it's added featuresif you type these command you will see the same output you would in idlefile = open('README.TXT', 'r')file.readline()but you are just running one line of code at a time and not the whole fileyou want to run the file from here type import yourFileNameHereyou will see the same output as running outside the interpreter now press ctl-z and then enter to exit the interpreter back to the cmd promptthat is the short of it, so that shows you some of the differences in the shell to a script and why they chose idle instead of thisthis makes it hard to explain, I know I just tried an probably just confused you.",leader

And that variable was passed to the function for you to use. In a3_driver.py the tkinter module is used to get the file name of the file to  open, then it is assigned to a variable and that variable is passed to the  function. In your function you are to use that variable as the open file, because it contains the open file. So a line like file = open(""myFile.txt"", ""r"") was done already, it was just not done by you. The variable board_file contains that exact code. Your self defined ""file"" variable has exactly the content as the passed ""board_file"" variable. All you have to do is use it.",leader

"okay lets seewe are working with board_contains correct.some of you metaphors are a little confusing sometimeand with a general of your example I would need to know more, butIt would probably have something to do with the order of your test and the fact what you are looking for something in something and the thing on the left is a list and the thing on the right is a string or even a boolean. and it should be the other way aroundlets look at the real functions as this is something that we know all the variables of  def board_contains_word(board, word):so we know that we have a board that is a list of listsand we have a word that is a stringthe error looks like you have the list and the string in the wrong places.but this function is a lot easier then most people are making it out to belets walk through a simple explanation of how to do this function with only 1 line of codeand you will under stand why only one line of code is need, if I explain it correctlyboard_contain_word takes 2 parameters, board and wordby now we have also written 2 other helper functionboard_contains_word_in_row() and board_contains_word_in_column()and both of them take 2 parameters, board and wordeach of the 2 function return True or Falsenow lets go back to week 3 lecture notes for type boolThe or Logic TableThe or operator evaluates to True if and only if at least one operand is True.As such, if the first operand is True, the second condition will not even be checked, because it is already known that the expression will produce True.expr1 expr2 expr1 or expr2True True TrueTrue False TrueFalse True TrueFalse False Falsenow this is what is important, the tableit says that if we have 2 expression and if one of them is True then it will return an answer of True, because at least one of them is Trueif this one is True or if this one is True then we get Truealso the only time we will get False, is when both of them are False.remember this is the or logic table and not the ""AND"", or ""NOT"" logic table, don't worry about them until you need them , you will not be using them here.okay now that we have done some review on the logic of ""OR"" now lets look at our board_contains_word functionand the helper functions board_contains_word will need to return True or Falseboard_contains_word_in_row() and board_contains_word_in_column() already return True or Falseeach helper function can be though of as an expressionand we can put them in the logic tableword_in_row(board, word) word_in_column(board, word) word_in_row() or word_in_column(board, word) True True TrueTrue False TrueFalse True TrueFalse False False  so the table above it the result of board_contains_word_in_row(board, word) or board_contains_word_in_column(board, word)and we know that the above expression will return True or False based on the logic tablenow the board_contains_word() function needs to return True or Falseand we have an expression that will return True or Falseall you need to do is write a return statement that uses the expression above",leader

"Again there is no best or better way of doing it. The way that takes all of the data in to account, processes all the data as needed, and returns the correct answer in a timely manner is the best way, and it can be achieved in many different ways, so there is no one best or better way. Assignment 2 is a good exampleIn the last 4 functions you are asked to write, you are told not to use str methods. Well in python, the ""Best Practices"" would be to use str methods if possiable, as they are build for this type of use.If we were allowed to use str methods then all the functions could be done with one-line function bodies like the first assignment. But then we would not have had any practice with for loops, if/elif/else blocks, char in string, or any of the other thing they want to teach us with this lesson. Which is the goal of the assignment, not to teach you the ""Best Practices"", but to teach you a first way. Before you can adopt a best practice, you need to know the different ways of doing things, and after you learn to do different thing you will learn what will work and what will not. And you will learn that the best practice is to write code that works as it should. If you want a ""Best Practices"" then look at the guide that is part of the python documentation http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ it is a guide not an end all be all of python, but fits you ""Best Practices"" definition better then any thing else I have seen.  ",leader

For example, to_24_hour_clock(hours) How many ways are there to do this?Not many, hours % 24 is the only one that comes to mind for me, given the variable hours and you just need to wrap it back to 0 after 23How did you do it?

You must have finished this week's series.2. You must have familiarity of roots (Square and Cube roots)3. You must be familiar with the print function (print() )4. You must not be tired. Attempt this exercise when you're feeling ready.Instructions: Create 2 functions.1. roots - define a function called ""roots"" that takes the parameters number and root.2. power - define a function called ""power"" that takes the parameters number and exponent.Description: This program will test your familiarity of Parenthesis, Exponentiation and Division operators, Function Definition and Variables. If you know the print function (print() ) use it. If you don't, just run it in the IDLE like this:# Press F5 to the editor to use the codes. >>> roots(25, 2) 5.0 >>> roots(27, 3) 3.0 >>> power(10, 2) 100 >>> power(2.5, 3) 15.625 Rules:1. You may search the internet for the formula as long as it's not coded in python.2. Please use The Python Visualizer and set the version to 3.3 there is a Generate URL button. please post your link when you're done.3. Please don't use the math module. The purpose of this puzzle will be useless if you used it to solve the 2 functions.Edit: Sorry guys, I have misled you with the parameters for power. But, you are free to name it whatever you like, so long as the program works.After you finished your program, click the Generate URL and post the link here. Feel free to ask me some questions :DThe code will be revealed in Sunday.

"There's no problem with the lecture summary, it's just fine. The only thing wrong is the typo which Etienne mentioned in that 'one decimal points' should be 'one decimal point' without the 's'. When it refers to 'one decimal point' it literally means just one decimal point and NOT the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. So, float ('-43.21') is perfectly valid. And so is float ('-43.215'), etc. Having float ('-43.2.1') will generate a ValueError since it actually has more than one decimal point. That's what is meant. As for the int function, there's no mention of one decimal point, two decimal point, etc. because as soon as you have anything other than a digit, i,e. a string with a decimal point, then it will generate a ValueError. And that is mentioned in the summary, i.e. int('-99.9') will generate a ValueError because it's not all digits. Hope this explains what is meant by decimal points.",leader

"Yeray, best way to approach this question is to break it down into two steps... First, look at the input, i.e. the arguments such as ""moose"" and ""scratch"". Yes, those are words but there is no such thing as a data type of 'word'. We learned earlier that anything in quotes is a string, so obviously those inputs are of the data type str. Second, look at the output, i.e. the returned values of 3 and 1. Yes, those are numbers but what type of numbers are they? You could say the 'Type Contract' is (str) -> number. But is that really accurate? Are 3 and 1 of the data type float, int, or possibly both? There's no decimal points so we know they're not floats. Therefore, there's only one possibility. The Type Contract has to be (str) -> int.",leader
"The terminal is a very basic way to interact with your computer. You can use the terminal to run Python or any other program for that matter. But, basically all you can do with a terminal is to type in commands. There's no menu bar, graphics, you can't use your mouse or anything like that. Anyways, that's what a terminal is suppose to be, just like it was in the 1950s. But a modern day terminal is now just a pop-up window that tries to look and act like a terminal, i.e. a so-called 'terminal emulator'.IDLE, though, is just for Python. You can't type commands to run a spreadsheet, for example. It's also a GUI (graphical user interface) that makes it easier to interact with your computer, in that it has a menu bar, you can use your mouse, etc. You can type in the same sort of commands as a terminal, if you're running Python, but it also has many other features. IDLE is also called an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in that it doesn't just run code but can also debug your code, run tests, etc.As to why you have two different versions of Python, i.e. 2.6.1 and 3.3.2, that's probably because your Apple operating system came with a pre-installed version of Python. And when you launch the terminal it points to the 2.6.1 version. No doubt you must have installed Python 3 on your system as well? So, no doubt IDLE is configured that run that version. I'm not an Apple user but you could probably configure the terminal to use Python 3 as well, if you really wanted to.But, as you probably know, for this course we're using Python 3, which does have some differences from version 2.",leader
"I'd just like to add that it's an excellent way of getting things done. And the idea that you start with the 'end result' first and then work your way backwards is used in a lot of other domains as well.So, for example, in the military they call it a time estimate as opposed to a design recipe. But it's the same idea. You start with the end result, i.e. a so-called h-hour in which you start the battle, and work your way backwards in terms of everything else that has to happen beforehand.Try it for your next vacation, for example, using the Function Design Recipe.

"I've done or participated in about a dozen different MOOCs over the past couple of years. And one thing that I can say which is very consistent, among all of them, is the low-balling of course workloads.A typical 6-8 hours per week usually means that you have some sort of prior experience with the subject material, that when you go through the various videos you watch them just one time, that when you attempt the various quizzes, exercises and assignments, that all goes well, pretty much on the first try.Also means that you don't really participate in the discussion forums either. Any sort of reading, analyzing, responding, and offering up suggestions in various threads can be quite consuming in terms of time as well. Which should also be factored in since a great deal of learning does come from the discussion forums.So, I know for myself, who's not a Python newbie, and already knows most of this stuff. Spending about 6-8 hours a week sounds about right. But for total newbies it's probably more like 12-15 hours a week. And maybe even more if you really don't get this stuff.But I wouldn't give up. It's just a question of time allocation. My advice would be to not try and do everything in one shot. Even if you do spurts of 15-20 minutes every now and then, it'll help quite a lot. And if you're really time constrained then just focus on the videos and the quizzes themselves. You can always re-take the course later on but will at least have some sort of prior experience.Good luck!",leader

"I think everyone understands how the 'variable' works in the 'for loop'. But I just wanted to say that it's quite a common thing to not fully understand how each part of the 'for loop' works, especially when it comes to the variable. A lot of people have problems with that part.Python itself is probably to blame since it tries to keep the code as short as possible and doesn't necessarily break things down. And a lot of Python code tries to look like a regular English sentence as well, hence 'for character in word' or 'for mark in english'. Which is great once you have experience and want to write programs. Not so great, though, if you're still trying to understand it.Breaking things down, we could have done the following as well, instead of a 'for loop'. But that's a lot of extra code for nothing: >>> total = 0 >>> english = [70, 75, 80] >>> >>> mark = english[0] # which is mark = 70 >>> total = total + mark >>> >>> mark = english[1] # which is mark = 75 >>> total = total + mark >>> >>> mark = english[2] # which is mark = 80 >>> total = total + mark >>> >>> total 225  And as we learned awhile ago, the names of variables should try to describe the actual content. So, using 'char = 70' or 'banana = 70', for this example, wouldn't be such a great idea. Although it could be fun. :)  ",leader

"Just a few things...First, the autograder is hosted on the University of Toronto computer system. One of the TA's had mentioned it in another thread. Maybe someone can find it? But every few seconds or so it checks with the Coursera platform to see if anything has been submitted.

Maybe I just got lucky but, for Assignment 1, I submitted 8 times within a period of 90 minutes. Basically submitting every 10 minutes after completing each step, one by one.So, it probably depends on the time of day, i.e. I started submitting around 3:30 AM (ET).

I don't even think that experienced programmers would have spotted that one, LOL. :)There does seem to be an error in the book, if you ask me. Seems to me that they're making the assumption that the shorthand version for assigning variables is the same as the regular assignment version, but it's not. For example: appointments = appointments + ['16:30'] appointments += ['16:30']  So, what ends up happening with a regular assignment is that a new object gets created, as expected. But with the shorthand version it's different in that the existing object gets modified instead. Here's some code in the Visualizer to see the difference in action. Also, notice I'm printing out the ID and that there is indeed a new list for the first one. But with the shorthand version it simply gets modified, i.e. just like the append method: Code in Python Visualizer And, here's some documentation that explains the difference between the two: http://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/simple_stmts.html#augmented-assignment-statements""An augmented assignment expression like x += 1 can be rewritten as x = x + 1 to achieve a similar, but not exactly equal effect. In the augmented version, x is only evaluated once. Also, when possible, the actual operation is performed in-place, meaning that rather than creating a new object and assigning that to the target, the old object is modified instead.""  ",leader

But that's not the way someone should be using Python and the very reason as to why all these pre-compiled built-in functions exist.Also, there's quite a lot of Python code that's out there in the so-called professional market and which is used in real-time but that we don't see simply because it's hidden or in some sort of backend. This is often the case for places like Google, Dropbox, and so on.As an example, there's a professor on Coursera that teaches quantitative analysis and his firm uses Python at the very backend, like all the way at the backend, to do portfolio management, optimization, time series analysis, event analysis, and so on. But you don't see it because it's coupled with various other software and everything communicates through JSON objects. So, someone using the actual software just sees an HTML5 frontend and has no clue that there's even any Python being used.  ",leader
"Nick, yes, those are all possibilities.But there are a lot of things to consider if you're going to self-host, for example:   usually upload speeds are not as fast as download speeds, which can make your site appear to be very sluggish, especially if your web pages are quite big. Or a lot of users at the same time.what about power outages? Do you have a backup system?what about maintenance and the amount of time that you have to take your site offline?So, running your own web server is not always the best solution. It really all depends on what you want to do and how much of your own personal time you're willing to put into it.  ",leader
"Yes it's possible. But it all depends on your ISP (Internet Service Provider).Some ISPs allow you to purchase a static IP address from them. Or you may already have a static IP address and it's just a matter of routing incoming traffic to the port where your web server is located.Big word of caution, though, not all ISPs allow their subscribers to host a web server. Some even block certain ports and it may even be a violation of your agreement to host a web server.Edit: You can also use a dynamic IP address as well.

What happens instead is one, two, or three different items will simply all point to the same location. What's more important in this question is to follow what's happening with i. You'll notice that in the for loop it gets assigned the values of 0, 3, 6 due to the step parameter of 3. So, plug in those values for i and then look at the corresponding indexes and their values to see what's being added up. And subsequently put into the merged list.

"Another interesting aspect is how Python will store variables and their values. This was mentioned in another thread by Professor Paul Gries and is considered advanced stuff, for now.But Python will convert the names of variables into strings in order to store them in a dictionary. Don't worry if you don't know about dictionaries yet, it'll be covered later on in the course. It's just a 'Key:Value' pair like a real dictionary. The 'Key' is the variable and the 'Value' is the value of the variable.Notice below how variables are stored. They're all strings. Notice int and float remain the same. Double-quotes get turned into single-quotes, except if you use both of them. And Unicode characters are actually characters but that may depend on your system.So, yes, technically, variables are strings. :-)  >>> my_variable_1 = 2.3456 >>> my_variable_2 = 23456 >>> my_variable_3 = ""this is a string"" >>> my_variable_4 = '\u65e6' >>> my_variable_5 = ""this is Dave's string"" >>> locals() {'__name__': '__main__', '__builtins__': <module 'builtins'>, 'my_variable_2': 23456, 'my_variable_3': 'this is a string', '__doc__': None, '__package__': None, '__loader__': <class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>, 'my_variable_1': 2.3456, 'my_variable_4': '旦', 'my_variable_5': ""this is Dave's string""}",leader
"One thing that hasn't been mentioned yet is the use of Unicode. It extends the use of the alphabet and the ability to use symbols, etc. Python has built-in support for Unicode.So, you may also see strings that look like this:  >>> u'café' 'café' OR >>> u'café' u'café'  Always interesting are the Greek and Chinese letters as well:  >>> u'\u65e6\u673c' '旦朼' >>> ""\N{GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA}"" 'Δ' >>> ""\u0394"" 'Δ' >>> ""\U00000394"" 'Δ' For people interested, you can read all about the history and use of Unicode in Python:Unicode HOWTOhttp://docs.python.org/3.3/howto/unicode.html",leader

"Thinking about it some more...Yes, I guess you could flip the clock in terms of a normal clock layout, if it was negative. So, if it was a negative clock then you simply flip it. This way you could keep the counter-clockwise motion of -3 and still arrive at an answer of 3, or -3 to be more precise since it's a negative clock.Not a bad way to think about either. It all depends on what works for you.",leader
"Yes, the answer is correct, it's -3. And your reasoning for going clockwise by 3 because it's both a negative clock and negative 3 is also correct.The only thing is your diagram of the clock. The layout of a normal clock doesn't change, so 3 would still be on the right, 9 on the left, etc. Otherwise it can get really confusing.",leader

Here's another example to try out using the clock system. Two negative numbers! :)-3 % -24Is that a positive or negative clock? And which way do we go? Clockwise or counter-clockwise?,leader
"There's an easy way to think about modulo and that's to use the 'clock' system. It's used fairly often in games, etc. such as rock-paper-scissors when you don't want to write a whole bunch of complex code in terms of who beat who. So, you simply represent everything onto a clock and move clockwise or counter-clockwise from the top.For example, -1 % 24 is very easy. That's a 24-hour clock, move counter-clockwise by 1 since it's negative 1, and where does the dial-hand point to? 23 obviously.How about 3 % 24? Again, move clockwise this time because 3 is positive and the dial-hand ends up at 3. Both these examples are known as positive clocks because the 24 is positive.A little more complicated but still the same principle are negative clocks. For example, 3 % -24 is considered a negative clock because 24 is negative. Which means we do the opposite of clockwise and counter-clockwise. So, in this example we move counter-clockwise by 3 and end up at 21 but it's a negative 21 because it's a negative clock.Hope it's not too confusing but once you understand the clock system it's very easy.P.S. Let's try the -134 % 24 that was mentioned above. That's a positive clock which means we move counter-clockwise 134 times. Which is equivalent to 5 complete rotations and 14 left over. Or -14 % 24. So, move counter-clockwise 14 times and where does the dial-hand point to? 10 obviously.",leader
"Nikhil, when I was referring to programming concepts it wasn't necessarily about mathematical concepts. It really was about programming concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, working with objects, and so on.For example, I see that you're signed up for the Interactive Programming course in October. Not quite sure if you know anything about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? But in that course you'll use Python to create objects from a ""class"" and interact with those objects through ""methods"". Those are very much programming concepts.So, once you understand how objects work in Python then, as I mentioned above, you'll pretty much understand how they work in other languages as well. You'll be amazed at how you'll be able to read and understand JavaScript or C#, for example, without even having taken a single course on those languages, LOL.As for the right way to learn?

"Claus, I agree with pretty much everything you wrote. Except that code redundancy, or repetitive code, isn't a special area.Everything we've learned in terms of how to design a function on this course has been to make sure we don't repeat ourselves.

Functions should always be unique.Same thing for 'if' and 'elif' statements. We learned that if you have multiple 'if's or 'elif's then it may be possible to use the logical operators 'and' and 'or' instead.So, to quote the Zen of Python... :) Beautiful is better than ugly;Simple is better than complex;Flat is better than nested; andThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it",leader

"In terms of the len() function, it's kind of special because it's a built-in function. Which means that the actual function is written in the C programming language. So, in order to work with a C function we need some sort of middleman. And that middleman is something called a 'wrapper'...""A built-in function object is a wrapper around a C function. Examples of built-in functions are len() and math.sin() (math is a standard built-in module). The number and type of the arguments are determined by the C function.""http://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/datamodel.htmlThere are different types of 'wrappers' in order to interface with the underlying language. Technical terms but there's 'method wrappers', 'slot wrappers', and so on. The built-in types like int, str, and list use 'slot wrappers':  >>> 'abc'.__len__ <method-wrapper '__len__' of str object at 0x000000000213F7D8> >>> type('abc'.__len__) <class 'method-wrapper'> >>> str.__len__ <slot wrapper '__len__' of 'str' objects> >>> type(str.__len__) <class 'wrapper_descriptor'>   Now, if you're not totally confused, this is the easy part...Not all objects require their own methods. Think of 'abc'.len() in terms of string methods. Doesn't exist because then we would need one for lists, tuples, and dictionaries as well. Much better to use a single generic C function with a wrapper on top. For now anyways. :)  ",leader
"Technically everything in Python is an object. It all depends in terms of how deep you want to go into the code. But even modules themselves are objects. For example:  >>> import math >>> math <module 'math' (built-in)> >>> type(math) <class 'module'> >>> id(math) 52724488 >>> import random >>> random <module 'random' from 'C:\\Python33\\lib\\random.py'> >>> type(random) <class 'module'> >>> id(random) 52690440  So, Python searched for the module when you I used 'import'. Found it, created an instance of the module class, i.e. an object, and assigned a variable, i.e. math, to point to the address of the object in memory, i.e. the id().In terms of the syntax, i.e. abc.xyz, it's just a hierarchy of left to right. We could easily have abc.def.ghi.jkl.xyz as well. But abc is an object, so is def, etc. For example:  >>> import builtins >>> builtins.len.__class__.__class__.__class__ <class 'type'>  And, as Stijn mentioned above, if you leave off the parentheses then you're just getting information, i.e. the attribute of the object. When you uses parentheses then you're obviously executing a method or function call. For example:  >>> str.find <method 'find' of 'str' objects> >>> id('abc') 35321816 >>> hex(35321816) '0x21af7d8' >>> 'abc'.find <built-in method find of str object at 0x000000000213F7D8> >>> type('abc'.find) <class 'builtin_function_or_method'> >>> 'abc'.find('c') 2",leader

"In terms of the above code, it's not that hard to learn OOP.

"It has to do with the concept of a 'slice'. If you think about it, let's take a pizza and 'slice' it up into four equal pieces, or slices. If you put those four pieces back together then it should equal the sum total of what the pizza looked like beforehand. Now, apply the same concept to the string 'Learn to Program'. If we 'slice' it up and then put it back together, well, it should be exactly the same as before. For example:  >>> s = ""Learn to Program"" >>> s 'Learn to Program' >>> s[0:4] + s[4:8] + s[8:12] + s[12:16] 'Learn to Program'  By making the second number 'non-inclusive' it facilitates our ability to break things apart. And if we ever have to put them back together then the slices won't overlap. Or get a sum total that is actually bigger than before.One quick way to think about slices is to take the difference between the two numbers. So s[8:12] has a difference of 4 which is 4/16 or 1/4 of the string. Pretty cool eh? :) The same concept applies to a sequence of numbers, exactly as Tom mentioned above. Instead of a 'slice', though, it's a 'range' of numbers. Notice how nothing overlaps and the sum total is still correct:  >>> range_1 = [x for x in range(0,10)] >>> range_1 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] >>> range_2 = [x for x in range(10,20)] >>> range_2 [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] >>> total_range = range_1 + range_2 >>> total_range [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]  Slicing and the range of numbers can be quite fun.

As opposed to other IDEs which are for Java, etc. but have Python plugins.Not quite sure of the mechanics, though, in terms of a 'Classroom License' and if that extends to MOOCs as well?

But all it does is to call the sum() function which in turns prints '4' to the console.So, for example, check out what the variable 'result' actually contains. You may be quite surprised: >>> def sum(number1, number2): print(number1 + number2) >>> result = sum(1, 3) 4 >>> result # notice that nothing seems to happen.

"Rupert, thanks. Nice way to visualize what's going on.",leader
"Also, some people may be wondering where this thing called 'None' is coming from? 'None' is like a placeholder which sort of represents nothing and is one of the 'Built-in Constants':http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/constants.htmlIn a function itself, if you don't specify a return statement then Python will still insert one. But it will return 'None' and you may not even notice. For example, both these functions do exactly the same thing: >>> def sum(number1, number2):	print(number1 + number2) >>> def sum(number1, number2):	print(number1 + number2) return None",leader
"One thing to keep in mind, in terms of functions, is that something will ALWAYS be returned. It's not a question of what's the difference between 'print' and 'return'. Something will always be returned, regardless if you print to the console or not.A function is like a 'blackbox'. You may not know its inner workings. Or how exactly it does its stuff. Or even care. But if you put something into a function, well, guess what, something will ALWAYS come out.Now, you may not actually notice it in Python, that something is being returned, but if you don't specify a return statement then a so-called hidden return statement will be inserted for you. And that so-called return is called 'None'. Which is basically equivalent to nothing but it's still something.So, the following two functions are exactly the same thing: >>> def f(x):	print(x * 2) >>> def f(x):	print(x * 2)	return None  Check out this code to see what's happening... >>> print(f(5)) 10 None >>> x = f(5) 10 >>> type(x) <class 'NoneType'> Notice in the first example that the function does its thing, prints '10' but then returns 'None', even though there was no return statement. You only notice that 'None' was returned if you actually print it out to the console.So, don't get confused with what a function actually does. It can print to the console, update a variable, turn your screen blue, or whatever. But it will always 'return' something. Either you can specify it, 'explicitly', in terms of what a function will return. Or, if not, then Python will actually do it for you, 'implicitly', by returning 'None'.",leader
"You have to remember that in Python it`s not the variable that gets stored in memory but the values themselves. So, if you then say x = 3, what will happen is you now just created a third object, i.e. the integer 3, and it`ll go into a third memory location.In terms of the garbage collector, it`ll eventually figure out that the first two objects, i,e. integers 1 & 2, no longer have the variable x pointing to them. Or any other variable for that matter. But it may or may not destroy them right away, i.e. releasing the memory location. I know we`ll get much deeper into how things actually work later on during the course, though, especially when we get to namespaces, functions, etc.",leader
"There's always a lot of confusion when it comes to Python and it's data typing, mainly due to the exact nature of what we've just been discussing, i.e. variables pointing to values. But Python is not a loosely or weakly-typed language, it's actually a strongly-typed language.So, for example, a string in Python is a string and an integer is an integer. You can't add different data types together like you would in JavaScript, for example. That's the difference between a strongly-typed and weakly-typed language.Python is also a dynamically-typed language as opposed to statically-typed. Amongst other things, this refers to the variables themselves. It makes sense that Python is considered as dynamically-typed since any variable could be pointing to an integer in one line of code and the exact same variable be pointing to a string in the next. That's the difference between dynamically-typed and statically-typed.And as Ivan mentioned, in Python it`s not really a good idea to state data types in variable names. Unless it`s for educational purposes and so on. But you can actually see what one of the reasons would be for not using such names from my example above, in that a variable could be pointing to an integer in one instance and then suddenly be pointing to a string in the next line of code.

"Abhishek, what you mentioned about programming concepts is so true.A lot of people who are new to programming always think that if I just learn a certain language, i.e. the syntax, then I'll know how to do stuff. But it's actually the complete opposite. Learning the syntax of a language is always the easy part. It's the programming concepts that are the hardest to learn, yet the most important. And Python is a great language to learn those concepts.So, for people new to programming, as you progress with Python and learn how to work with functions, methods, objects, etc., one thing you'll notice is that eventually you'll be able to look at other languages such as JavaScript, C#, etc. and actually understand what's going on, without even having taken a single course related to those languages. That's the power of programming concepts.",leader

So, if you overwhelm people with a ton of homework, especially at the beginning, then you're going to lose a lot of people who will simply drop out.Also, as has been previously mentioned, this is an introductory course and that programming itself is quite new to a lot of people taking this course. So, it's always better to ease into the process instead of hitting them with a ton of bricks.Good luck on the course though.",leader

There's the r variable in the front followed by the for loop and then the conditional if statement at the end.

"Creating a test is a possibility. But, as discussed in previous threads and more generic to programming in general, if you're going to test something then you need to test for all possibilities. Now, creating sample data that can test for all possibilities can be quite problematic, in that you may not know if it's actually testing for all possibilities.For example, it's always fun to test-drive a car. But did you also take it on the highway and into the back woods? How about at night? Or during the winter?Another approach is to look at the code itself and what is required of the function. So-called tracing the code by hand. So, given (4) choices and only (1) correct answer, what you can do instead is to eliminate each choice, one-by-one, simply but looking at the 'if' statements and the logic itself.Or, you can always pick c) which also works just as good. ;-)  ",leader

First thing we have to do is check to see if something is 'greater than 3'. We don't want to check if something is 'greater or equal to 3'. So, Rich had an answer with >= as one of his options.

"Checking the length of a postal code is definitely a good idea. But from I understand the UK postal codes can be anywhere from 5-8 characters in length?There's also a third option which is a little more complicated and involves the use of 'regular expressions'. Not sure if you've heard of regular expressions before? But they're used to make sure postal codes, phone numbers, etc. are all valid. For example, here's some code that checks whether a string is a valid UK postal code: >>> import re >>> post_code_1 = 'AA11 1AA' >>> post_code_2 = 'AA111AA' >>> print(re.findall(r'[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9R][0-9A-Z]? [0-9][A-Z]{2}', post_code_1)) ['AA11 1AA'] >>> print(re.findall(r'[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9R][0-9A-Z]? [0-9][A-Z]{2}', post_code_2)) [] >>> re.findall(r'[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9R][0-9A-Z]? [0-9][A-Z]{2}', post_code_1) != [] True >>> re.findall(r'[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9R][0-9A-Z]? [0-9][A-Z]{2}', post_code_2) != [] False  Basically regular expressions check to see if a string is in a certain format. In the above code, if the postal code is valid then it gets put into a list. If the postal code is not valid then the list is empty. Which means you can check if the list is empty or not, i.e. True or False. And in the above example we know postal_code_2 is not valid because the list is empty.The format of the regular expression above is one that I Googled so I'm not even sure if it's 100% valid in terms of UK postal codes. But there are regular expressions out there for just about everything, including credit card numbers, email addresses, etc.So, regular expressions are just another option to think about if you want to test for validity.Edit: Reference the regular expression method, I'm sure there's a better one than 'findall' since that one is more for finding a particular string in a much larger string such as a text file.

The moment Python sees the for statement it knows that it's suppose to go into a loop. And that's the only thing it knows. What next? Well, Python knows that it has to grab the first thing that's inside whatever follows the in keyword, such as:    for thing in team: # which could also be written as... for thing in ['Dave', 'Bob', 'Joe', 'Mike']:  So, we get thing = 'Dave', thing = 'Bob', thing = 'Joe', etc. as the loop keeps going around. Now, to create a loop that's going to be used for indices, what do we need? Is s['Dave'] going to work or how about s['Mike']. No, none of those will work. They don't even make any sense. Obviously what we need Is a bunch of numbers. Ideally numbers that go from 0-9, 1-5, or whatever. And it would look something like this instead:    for thing in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]: # which could also be written as... for thing in range(5):   So, we now get thing = 0, thing = 1, thing = 3, etc. Much better! Which is like saying s[thing] or s[0], s[1], s[2], etc. Notice any real difference between the two loops? That's right, there is no difference, except for the fact that if we're going to be working with indices then we need numbers. Hope this put you back on track.  ",leader

"I don't think there is a way to clear the screen in IDLE? I know it's one of those feature requests that a lot of people have been asking for, i.e. just a simple CLS command.Some people have suggested creating a function that prints like a hundred blank lines and then just calling it. But that's obviously a lot of trouble, for example... >>> def cls(): print(""\n"" * 100) >>> cls()  The following seems to work in a regular command line terminal. But obviously no good for IDLE itself...  >>> import os >>> os.system('clear') 1 >>> os.system('CLS') 0  Not quite sure why something like that in IDLE isn't quite standard yet? As opposed to exiting or restarting the shell, which isn't all that great either.",leader
"Yes, they're all remainders.So, if you think about carefully, for example, 4 divided by 5 is like trying to squeeze 5 into 4. But of course it won't go because it's too big so what you have left over is 4, i.e. a remainder of 4.Same idea or principle for the other numbers.",leader

"Tom explained Option 3 pretty well. Just think about what will happen if the temperature is 28 or below.In Option 1 the temperature DOESN'T have to be above 28 in order to get to the elif. That's the whole purpose of these 'if' and 'elif' statements. If the first 'if' is False then it continues down the line, i.e. there could be an infinite number of 'elif's, until it finds one that's True. Of course if nothing is True then nothing gets executed.Also, there's no function to 'initiate' in those lines of code. Are you thinking these if/elif statements are some sort of function? The only function is the print() function.And notice how Option 1 & 2 are exactly the same except for the redundant code in Option 1. If you look close at the 'if' statements, if money is not greater than 0.99 then we know it must be <= 0.99 which means we don't need to check it again.Very interesting example though.",leader
"Another solution, if you're really stuck, is to quickly put together a module of the three functions and just run it in IDLE, i.e. create a file called word.py, for example. It could be that you know what you're doing but it's just that your syntax is wrong.So, you'd create something like this, 'Run' the module, and then call the count_letters() function from the Python Shell in IDLE to see if your syntax is correct. Obviously you would have to fill in the dots with the appropriate parameters, etc.  def count_vowels(...): return ... def count_consonants(...): return ... def count_letters(word): return ... >>> ================================ RESTART ================================ >>> >>> count_letters('lynn') ... >>> Hope this helps as well.Edit: These are dummy functions, obviously, that don't really count the vowels and consonants. But are just to check your syntax.",leader
"Lynn, don't try to over think the problem. The idea is very simple. It's like...  return 3 + 4  You know how a return statement works right? I'm pretty sure you know how to call a function as well? Just make sure you spell the function names correctly and as Tom mentioned, don't add extra parentheses.You'll probably kick yourself once you get it right. And hang in there.",leader

"Vijay, I understand what your're saying and the answer is definitely yes. In terms of Python, one of the best tools to do math is to use an IPython notebook:http://ipython.org/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPythonIt's very similar to something like Mathematica or Maple but you're doing as you suggest, math and coding skills at the same time.

"Evelyn, I also took the Interactive Programming course, like a year ago. Definitely a lot of fun but also quite a lot of work. If you're doing good on this course then it'll help quite a lot in terms of trying to understand what's actually going on in that course.What I'm about to describe is not giving anything away, in terms of the Interactive Programming course, so don't worry. They basically tell you which method to use in the random module. Which is actually kind of sucky, if you ask me, since it's way too simple. You yourself probably already know how to create your own function that actually shuffles a bunch of cards. It's just a matter of following a bunch of steps. But more on that later.So, I'm not going to get into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) since you'll learn all about that in October. But here's a very basic way of creating a deck of 52-cards that are just numbers...  >>> import random >>> deck = [] >>> for card in range(52):	deck.append(card) >>> deck [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51] >>> random.shuffle(deck) >>> deck [14, 32, 35, 6, 42, 49, 19, 40, 11, 39, 9, 27, 33, 23, 10, 16, 36, 24, 13, 30, 43, 37, 28, 38, 46, 17, 3, 51, 15, 4, 20, 12, 26, 22, 25, 21, 48, 34, 18, 29, 1, 50, 7, 31, 45, 47, 44, 0, 2, 41, 8, 5] This is all stuff you already know. Pretty easy isn't it? Notice the 'import' statement to import the random module. There's an accumulator, the range function, the append method for a list. And the only thing that's new is the 'shuffle' method.Now, in real life those numbers would actually be objects, i.e. cards. But I think you still get the idea.How to pick a card? You could use the range function again, as described above, or just deal the first/last card from the deck by using the 'pop' method.I love the 'pop' method and you'll definitely need to know that one. :)P.S. I'm also a croupier in real life, so I'll make another post to describe what actually happens in a real shuffle. Which is definitely much more interesting than the 'shuffle' method, that's for sure.  ",leader
"Yes, all Nick's are anarchists. :)Just kidding. Hope a positive decision is made very soon as well.The only valid reason I can see for not posting code is that the class will be run again. But that doesn't seem to be a problem for a lot of other courses. For people who want to cheat in the future, well, they'll just get the working code from their friends. Or Google it. Or whatever.Most people, if you ask me, are taking courses like this to actually learn something. Cheating on the assignments isn't going to turn you into a programmer.",leader
"Yes, that's a great one. Actually gives you the whole number.",leader
"Or, if you really want to get fancy, use an input statement inside the module for each grade. That way when you run the module it will ask you to input the grades inside the shell.Not sure if you're getting a NameError? But if you don't define the grade variables within the module then Python doesn't know what to do when it gets to the 'if' statements. It tries to do something with the 'if' statement but it's never heard of grade1 or grade2 before. So it produces an error like...  >>> ================================ RESTART ================================ >>> Traceback (most recent call last): File ""C:\Python33\Temp\grades.py"", line 18, in <module> if grade1 >= 50 and grade2 >= 50: NameError: name 'grade1' is not defined  Is that what you were getting? ",leader
"Easiest way is to create a separate .py file and run it as a module, like you did. Paste the code from the question but be sure to include the two grade variables inside the module as well. And change them as you test. For example:  grade1 = 55.0 grade2 = 49.0 total = 0 grade_count = 0 ##if grade1 >= 50: ## total = total + grade1 ## grade_count = grade_count + 1 ## if grade2 >= 50: ## total = total + grade2 ## grade_count = grade_count + 1 ## ##if grade_count > 0: ## print(total / grade_count) ##else: ## print(0.0) If grade1 >= 50 and grade2 >= 50: total = grade1 + grade2 grade_count = 2 If grade_count > 0: print(total / grade_count) else: print(0.0)  Also, what you can do is just create one .py file instead of four. Or instead of copy/pasting on top of prior code just comment out the previous code. For example, select and highlight the lines then use Alt + 3 to 'Comment Out a Region' or Alt + 4 to 'Uncomment a Region'.",leader
"Is that your entire code for that particular function? I haven't started Assignment 2 yet. But... First, all 'return' statements have to go inside a function definition, for example: def your_function(parameter): return None  Second, everything has to be properly aligned and indented. Third, not quite sure why you're using is instead of ==. Is that part of the assignment? ",leader

"Nick, not going to post any code until a decision is made. But I did it the same way.No errors from start to finish. :)",leader
"For people interested in the actual number and how it gets created there's a couple of things to know. And all of this can be found in the link above. Highly recommend you bookmark that Python web page for future reference. First, as Nick mentioned, all numbers can't be represented by 1s and 0s. So there's this standard that has been developed over the years to approximate certain numbers. The standard is known as IEEE 754, with the latest version being IEEE 754-2008. And this standard is pretty much in all computers:   http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/ http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4610935   Second, there's the easy way to calculate floats and the actual number. And then there's the hard way which is more step by step using formulas. Easy way is to use existing functions. Floats are just two integers divided by themselves so you can use the decimal or fractions modules. Here's several examples in terms of how to find the two integers that created the float for 7 / 3:    >>> from decimal import Decimal >>> from fractions import Fraction >>> >>> Fraction.from_float(2.3333333333333335) Fraction(5254199565265579, 2251799813685248) >>> 5254199565265579 / 2251799813685248 2.3333333333333335 >>> format(5254199565265579 / 2251799813685248, '.60f') '2.333333333333333481363069950020872056484222412109375000000000' >>> format(5254199565265579 / 2 ** 51, '.60f') '2.333333333333333481363069950020872056484222412109375000000000' >>> 2251799813685248 == 2 ** 51 True >>> >>> (2.3333333333333335).as_integer_ratio() (5254199565265579, 2251799813685248) >>> Decimal.from_float(2.3333333333333335) Decimal('2.333333333333333481363069950020872056484222412109375') >>> format(Decimal.from_float(2.3333333333333335), '.17') '2.3333333333333335' >>> format(Decimal.from_float(2.3333333333333335), '.53') '2.333333333333333481363069950020872056484222412109375'   Definitely no lack of functions.Hope this was a good summary. If anyone is interested in doing it the hard way, which is more step by step using formulas, then let me know. The Python document shows you how to do it for 0.1 but 7 / 3 is slightly harder. Nice little challenge. :)",leader
"Everything you need to know about how floating point numbers work in Python can be found in this document:   http://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html It's a bit long and complicated for people who aren't familiar with how things work but I can explain some of the stuff and summarize the important parts. First, there are two very important things when it comes to floating point numbers. There's the actual number and then there's the representation of the number. Some programmers even call the representation an illusion. :) Second, in Python, floating point numbers can either be represented by 17 significant digits or a shortened version. For example, 0.10000000000000001 or 0.1. Significant digits include all digits, both to the left and the right of the decimal point, except if the left digit is zero. So, using your example of 7 / 3 and 2.3333333333333335 you'll notice that it has 17 significant digits. Which is 1 to the left of the decimal point and 16 to the right. That's how Python displays a floating point number. But this number is a representation and NOT the actual number. In the next post, having covered the basics, I'll show you how to see the actual number and why it's a 5... ",leader
"Restarting the shell does clear out existing variables. But it's purpose is very much like a 'reset' in other applications. Think of a game that you've been playing for awhile. You either don't like how it's going or you'd simply like to start over.As for saving the work that you've done, the shell isn't really the place to save stuff. It's more of a place to have a conversation with your computer, don't laugh. A place where you have some sort of interactive session to test your ideas, get feedback, have the computer do stuff for you, and so on. Exactly like a telephone conversation in that you don't save your telephone conversations do you?But if you did want to save your work, i.e. function definitions, fancy expressions, etc. then all that work should really be saved in a separate module.

Second example, is how to format with 17 significant digits. Notice the 'g' after 17. Third example, is how to format with 16 digits to the right of the decimal point. Notice the 'f' after 16. What's important to note is these are representations and NOT the actual number. And that they all do the same thing. Now the exciting part. Have you figured out how to see the actual number? Yes, that's right, just expand the number of digits to the right of the decimal point and voila! :)  >>> format(7 / 3, '.60f') '2.333333333333333481363069950020872056484222412109375000000000'  Notice something really interesting?

"Here's some ways to think about slicing using the example above. First, what does the slice 'Learn to Program'[1:5] tell us about its length? We know the slice earn has a length of 4 characters. But could we have figured that out by looking at [1:5] or [-15:-11]? Notice that the difference between the two numbers is 4. What's the length of 'Learn to Program'[9:16] which returns Program? It's 7 of course, len('Learn to Program'[9:16]) returns 7. So, one of my friends makes a cake that looks exactly like 'Learn to Program'. We've just passed the course and there's four of us. Luckily it has a length of 16 which can be easily sliced up into four pieces. How do we do that? Well, it's very easy: >>> s = 'Learn to Program' >>> s1 = s[0:4] >>> s2 = s[4:8] >>> s3 = s[8:12] >>> s4 = s[12:16]  Remember to use the difference between the numbers so that the length for each slice is 4. And to think about the two cuts in terms of where the edges are. Now, at this point, somebody makes a comment and my friend who made the cake feels insulted, grabs all four pieces and puts them back into the box. What does the cake look like now? Or what should it look like? Let's try to put the four slices back together: >>> cake_in_box = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 >>> cake_in_box 'Learn to Program'  It's magic!

"And help on a file object does work.You just need to make sure that you've created the object. For example:  >>> file = open('temp.txt', 'r') >>> help(file) Help on TextIOWrapper object: Class TextIOWrapper(_TextIOBase) | Character and line based layer over a BufferedIOBase object, buffer. ... >>> help(file.readlines) Help on built-in function readlines: readlines(...)

"The .readlines() and .read() methods are part of the io module:  http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/io.htmlThe io module is a bit complicated since a lot of methods are inherited from base classes that are higher up in the hierarchy. And these inherited methods may actually be overridden in the current class as well.So, you could do this, by starting at the top and try to find what you're looking for:  >>> import io >>> help(io) At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class IOBase... Or, you could check out what sort of object you created by starting at the bottom:  >>> file = open('temp.txt', 'r') >>> file <_io.TextIOWrapper name='temp.txt' mode='r' encoding='cp1252'> >>> help(io.TextIOWrapper) Help on class TextIOWrapper in module io... >>> help(io.TextIOWrapper.readlines) Help on method_descriptor: readlines(...) Return a list of lines from the stream... If you read the help on TextIOWrapper you'll notice that the method resolution order goes from TextIOWrapper to TextIOBase to IOBase and finally to builtins.object at the top.And that the method .readlines() is inherited from IOBase. So you could do this as well:  >>> help(io.IOBase.readlines) Help on method_descriptor: readlines(...) Return a list of lines from the stream. hint can be specified to control the number of lines read: no more lines will be read if the total size (in bytes/characters) of all lines so far exceeds hint.  Hope that helps somewhat.  ",leader

I've been on a few courses where people thought they had an extra day, due to the time zones, when in fact the deadline was minutes away, i.e. due on Tuesday but it's a Monday in local time.I don't think anyone is complaining, in this thread anyways, of not knowing the deadlines. It literally is a last-minute thing. But to the credit of the professors on this course I don't think they could have made it any simpler. Here are some of the things they did: they standardized all the deadlines so that everything is due on a Monday at noon (ET).they've removed the penalties if you go beyond the 'soft' deadline, i.e. you get an extra week.  Which means you actually get a full two weeks instead of one week, without penalty. Not counting the 11:59 bug of course. ;-)I've been on some courses where there was two different deadlines per week, i.e. Monday & Saturday. Plus two more if you considered the whole soft/hard deadline issue where your score would lose a certain percentage each day that you were late, gradually getting to zero as the hard deadline approached.Plus assignments or projects that had their own deadlines and then another deadline to submit the actual peer assessment which was a certain number of days after that one.LOL, just crazy.",leader

"I think the premise is that you don't really want modules printing to the console every time a function is called, unless that's what you really want. So think of a complete program with hundreds of function calls and perhaps dozens of modules. That program may not even use the console at all, i.e. it may use a graphical user interface (GUI) instead.The shell is different. It's meant to be interactive where you get some sort of feedback. Either for running small snippets of code, debugging, or whatever.That's probably the most obvious reason, if you ask me?",leader
"Vijay, I have a great example for you that relates specifically to the mathematical thinking course that you're doing. Not sure if you've learned how to work with implications yet? But you're going to love this. You were wondering ""if programming could actually help me learn Math"". So let's use some programming and Python itself to do some 'mathematical thinking'. Here we go... Implication is about if/then statements, i.e. p implies q or p => q or not(p) or q using logical operators. In plain English, it's implied that ""if I learn programming then I'll learn mathematics"". So, if it's True that I learned programming and it's True that I learned mathematics then the implication is True, i.e. p => q is True. In Python it looks like this...  >>> p, q = True, True >>> not(p) or q True If it's True that I learned programming and it's False that I learned mathematics then the implication is False, i.e. p => q is False. Which makes sense...  >>> p, q = True, False >>> not(p) or q False  If it's False that I learned programming and it's True that I learned mathematics then the implication is True, i.e. p => q is True. This one is harder to understand but it still makes sense. If I don't learn programming then I'm still free to do whatever I want in terms of mathematics. It was never implied that If I didn't learn programming that I couldn't learn mathematics.  >>> p, q = False, True >>> not(p) or q True  If it's False that I learned programming and it's False that I learned mathematics then the implication is True, i.e. p => q is True. Last one...  >>> p, q = False, False >>> not(p) or q True  Learning Math through programming, in action. :-)",leader

"That is a great example. I've done some of those tutorials by Allen B. Downey before.

"Running a module is before week 3. But it's possible that you just haven't tried it out yet, i.e. tried to run some of the examples from the video lectures. It's kind of important though.The shell is just the place where you type your code but your code will disappear after you close IDLE. So, if you want to save your code then you would save it in a '.py' file, i.e. a module. And then 'Run' it later.",leader
Excellent! Glad to hear that. :),leader
"I'm sure you've run a module before. A module is just a Python file such as word.py So, in the above example, I started IDLE, then 'File' -> 'New Window'. In that new window I typed out the code for the three functions and saved it as word.py Then you select 'Run' -> 'Run Module' from the menu bar which will make the functions available in the Python Shell. Just a matter of calling the count_letters() function after that.",leader
"Forgot to mention, that's a nice little recursive function to play around with.Not too complicated but just complicated enough, thanks.",leader
"Tim explained the recursive process and notation fairly well. But you can also just look at the code and visually step through it to figure out what's going on.As Tim mentioned, the argument is an index or the position in the Fibonacci sequence. So index 0 is the first number, index 1 is the second number, i.e. fib(7) will return 13 which is the 8th number in the sequence.First index is easy, fib(0) will hit the 'if' statement and return 0, end of function call. Second is also easy, fib(1) jumps past the 'if' statement, will hit the 'elif' and return 1, end of function call.Third index, fib(2), starts to get interesting. It'll hit the 'else' statement and this is where recursion starts. We know n = 2 but we actually have two function calls in the 'else' statement. No problem, one gets called and does it thing then the second one gets called and does its thing. Then the returns of those two get added together and the whole thing is returned.So, when n = 2, we get a function call of fib(2-1) or fib(1) which returns 1. And a function call of fib(2-2) or fib(0) which returns 0. Which in turn returns 1 + 0 which is 1. Does fib(2) or the index 2 of the Fibonacci sequence equal to 1? The answer is yes.In terms of recursion, don't think about a function calling itself. Just think of it as the first function calling another function, which just happens to have the exact same code.Using the Python Visualizer you can see the frames being stacked on top of each other every time the function gets called. It's very obvious when you use higher index numbers. Initially it'll create a stack of frames and then work backwards returning values to the previous frame: http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=def+fib(n)%3A%0A++++if+n+%3D%3D+0%3A%0A++++++++return+0%0... Notice the number of steps. As you go higher it's not just an increase in steps but an exponential increase in the number of steps. Simply because you have function calls in function calls which in turn create even more function calls.The only thing you may not notice is that once a frame returns a value to the previous frame, it'll disappear and a new one will be created. But that's hard to tell because, guess what, the function calls all have the same name. :-)",leader
"Alan, wow, not quite sure why you think that you can't learn mathematics by programming? The links that Allen Harper provided below are a perfect example of exactly that. Allen B. Downey is renowned for teaching Bayesian methods, for example, through programming and Python itself. As for the 'real mathematics' you described above. That's pure mathematical thinking which lays the foundation for all other higher-level mathematics. And it lends itself quite well to learning through programming since it's pure logic without the philosophical aspects. For example, set theory, logic, relationships, equivalence, implication, and proofs, can all be done through Python. In fact, one of the data structures within Python is sets. And implications like p => q, i.e. 'p' implies 'q', can be expressed as not(p) or q. That's basic Truth Table stuff.As for today's theoretical physicists, all their work is based on computer models and the writing of programs. You can't get much higher-level than the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the use of computers to detect the Higgs boson.",leader
"As Debashis mentioned, the differences between the two versions is minor.Having knowledge of one version over the other isn't going to give you any sort of advantage. The two versions have more to do with legacy code and stuff that's under the hood. And obviously with syntax.But why is the MIT course using version 2.7? I don't know but they must still be using some sort of legacy code for their auto-graders, for example. Or maybe they're doing something that uses JavaScript in a web page which can't be done with version 3?Personally I think everyone should be using version 3. Especially the schools who are teaching this stuff.  ",leader
"In terms of the design of the course or of the so-called pedagogy for beginners.I think it's quite arguable in terms of the best way to go about things. This course, though, is very much a methodical approach where you learn things step-by-step. Everything is quite explicit and built on top of previous learning. It's almost like learning grade school math.Now, for some people they obviously love that sort of approach. For others less so. Is there one way or a best way to design a course for beginners? That delivers the best outcome?I don't know but it's certainly quite debatable.  ",leader
"As for the course prerequisites and so-called 'absolute beginners'. I agree that most of the time courses like this are couched in a way that when they mean beginners or ""this course is intended for people who have never seen a computer program"", well, there's sort of an unwritten assumption that you know what a computer is and how it works. That you can think logically and that you have a certain capacity to not only understand but also absorb the material that is being presented to you.Now, maybe they should be more explicit in terms of the prerequisites? And try to cover all the caveats? I don't know. But I think it would probably be quite a long list.Just a side note, and no disrespect to beginners, so I hope that some people don't take it the wrong way. But this course is very much considered as being one of the easiest. The pace, the workload, and the amount of material you have to absorb on other so-called beginner courses is usually much more intense and definitely more time consuming. Just take a look at the Rice, MIT, Stanford or University of Washington courses, for example.  ",leader

As someone who has previous experience, I look at the assignments as an average of 1-hour per week, another hour for the videos, another hour for the exercises. And another hour to discuss things on the forums? That's already 4-hours and I haven't even checked out the lecture notes, re-watched videos, tinkered around with the code, or just hung out in the forums.

"Evelyn, I understand what you're saying... But random is random.It doesn't matter whether you choose to shuffle the cards in a so-called 'fixed' list, for example, and to then choose the first card. Or have a 'fixed' list and randomly choose an index number from 1 to 52. It's the exact same thing. In fact, the shuffle method actually calls random within the random module to shuffle the cards. There's no difference.Now, obviously, using the pop method is totally different. If you remove a card from the deck then there's absolutely no chance whatsoever that it can be selected again. Only way for that particular card to be selected again would be to reconstitute the deck.In terms of the shaman, that's so easy to do. There's a bag with 27 stones, each stone has a face and a back, i.e. 54 possible definitions. Those are like the properties. They're like 'upside down' or 'right-side up'. You simply create a list which represents the bag. Each stone is an object in that bag and you can either shuffle them or leave them 'as is' to then select randomly.In fact, once the stones are an object there's no limit. Simply create an object to represent the mound and 'pop' the stones from the bag onto the mound. From there it's just a matter of writing 'if' statements to see how the stones ended up, i.e. did they stack on top of each other, did they group together, are they alone, or whatever.Rinse and repeat, very easy to do. :)  ",leader

"Anonymous, in terms of ""Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python"", it's difficult in the following senses...In this course we spend a lot of time on the fundamentals, exactly as the title suggests, which is really good. So we learn about the function design recipe, how to properly write a docstring, how the visualizer works, etc.In the IIPP course, though, how functions work are like a whopping 10-minutes. Forget about how to properly write a docstring or anything to do with a function design recipe. There's no time for any of that.Instead of one exercise per week, there's like two. Instead of one assignment every two weeks there's like one per week. And they're not assignments but mini-projects. So you have to build a complete game of Memory, Pong, Blackjack, etc., each one, all in a week.Plus, after submitting your mini-projects, you then have to peer-assess a minimum of five other min-projects, per week. You know, looking at other people's code and grading it.

"Not bad but there's a few things that could be improved. For example, there's a lot of repetitive code that could be easily replaced with the use of variables. If you have two functions like range100() and range1000() that do the exact same thing then you know there's a problem.So, you could do something like the following instead. Create a single initialization function that uses variables and a formula to calculate the number of guesses for each range. Something like this:  secret_num = random.randrange(0, num_range) # formula to calculate the number of allowed guesses is 2 ** n >= high - low + 1 Count1 = math.ceil(math.log(num_range, 2))  Guess the number is always interesting. :)",leader
"The string module still exists but most of the functions that once existed in earlier versions of Python have now been turned into string methods instead. Here's one function that still exists, though, inside the string module and is actually kind of handy:  >>> import string >>> text = "" lEaRn tO proGram "" >>> string.capwords(text) 'Learn To Program'  In terms of functionality, there are several reasons why some functions are in a modules and why some functions are methods instead and live in a class. The issue of memory has already been mentioned above but here's a few more...First, it doesn't always make sense to create methods for everything. You'd be writing a lot of duplicate code for nothing. For example, take the len() function. Why is there no string method that gives us the length of a string, i.e. my_string.len(). The answer is because having one generic function that calculates the length of a string can also be used for other types as well. Like lists, for example. One function, many applications.Second, there's the historical legacy aspect. No doubt it took awhile to turn string functions into string methods. I can imagine that a lot of existing code uses the square root function, for example. We could probably create a square root method that is tied directly to a number when it's created. Something like the following but there's probably no need:  >>> 144.sqrt() 12.0  No doubt there many other reasons but I hope this is somewhat useful in explaining the differences.",leader

Always trying to play around with the various exercises in the videos, in the assignments, etc.But I wouldn't get too hung up on the assignments. They're deliberately made to be annoying and to test your patience. Sadly, for better or for worse, a lot of programming involves so-called mathmatic word problem structures. These assignments are deliberately designed to take you out of your comfort zone and to introduce you to problem domains that you may not even care about. They're just a test to see if you can break things down into various components. And have the ability to follow step-by-step instructions. Know doubt as you gain more experience it will all seem very trivial.One thing I'd suggest is to post more of your tinkering.You know, small snippets of code, or whatever.

"Sometimes there are subtle differences between a right and a wrong answer. And it doesn't take very much for it to be marked incorrectly, i.e. you added an extra space, left out a parentheses, etc.But there's one thing you can do since you have both a correct answer and an incorrect answer. And that is to compare the two strings. For example:  >>> test5 = 'your_function(another_function(argument1, argument2))' >>> test7 = 'your_function(another_function(argument1, argument2))' >>> test5 == test7 True  Now, that will tell you right away if your answers are indeed both the same.Next, if they are the same then the next step would be to check the actual questions. As you re-attempt certain exercises, the questions may change. There's a built-in mechanism to randomly produce new questions and even change the answers on different attempts. I don't think that's the case for this particular question though. It seems to remain the same but it's always a good idea to check beforehand.Hope the idea of comparing strings helped out.",leader

"I don't think it's unique to Python. I'm pretty sure there are other languages out there that use the same method.But I do know that a fair amount of other languages don't do it that way at all.

But of course it's not like that at all.For example, once you start making one variable being equal to another variable, strange things start to happen.

So, thinking about an airplane, for example, what are some of the so-called 'parameters' or things that we can 'measure'? It could be expressed as follows: def airplane(speed, altitude, heading, etc.)  Now, what are the 'actual parameters' or 'actual measurements', which we call arguments?

"Noreen, if I could just say something about those courses since I'm somewhat familiar with both of them.

And he actually stipulates ""will teach you how the pieces of a language fit together to create more than the sum of the parts"", LOL.The Interactive Python course at Rice University is very much the second school of thought. You've picked a horse and it's Python. It's suppose to be an introductory course but they'll bring you up to a higher-level by doing object-oriented programming, working with a graphical user interface, and so-called event-driven programming. It's not to say that this isn't applicable to other languages, quite the contrary, but it's still focused on Python.Either way, both those courses are still pretty tough.

"My advice would be to not try to memorize the terminology. Much better to understand the meaning instead, if you ask me. It's like trying to memorize a physics formula, which can be extremely hard. And you're no further ahead if you ever have to use it. Much better to understand what the formula is saying in the first place.Usually the terminology is just plain English and will immediately jump out at you if you look closely enough. Here's some basic examples and ways to think about what we've learned so far...Variables are things that vary. Again, it's just plain English.Arguments are constantly changing. Think of an actual argument, i.e. one with your spouse or girlfriend. Everyone has a different argument and it could be anything.Expressions are things that people utter or say. In Python an expression is something that you, as the programmer, won't say but would type out as text instead.Expressions get evaluated, just like in real life. If someone expresses a certain feeling towards me then the first thing I'm going to do is try to figure out or 'evaluate' what they just said.Evaluate is just a process that literally means what it means, i.e. you'll get some sort of 'value'.Frames are exactly like picture frames. You know, those square things you hang on the wall. Frames are a diagram with four lines, one for each side, and they have something inside.Stacks are exactly like whatever stack you can think of. In Python we stack a bunch of frames on top of one another. That's all a stack is. If you don't believe me then just look at a picture of a call stack, i.e. it's just a diagram of 4-sided boxes (frames) stacked on top of each other.  So, if you look closely at all this so-called terminology you'll soon notice that a lot of it is just plain English. And that you probably already know the meaning of these words. And that there's usually no real need to memorize or look up anything.",leader

"Mastering a language would be quite a feat and an accomplishment, that's for sure. I don't think anyone has truly mastered a language? Okay, maybe a select few but these are the elite programmers. No doubt, though, they are still learning new things everyday.In terms of going from Python to another language, I would say anyone who finishes this course and follows-up with some object-oriented programming (OOP) could easily learn another language very quickly. It's always the concepts that are the hardest to learn, not the syntax of a language.In fact, I would even say that you could look at a C# program, for example, or JavaScript, without any prior experience. And actually understand what's going on. It would just be a matter of understanding the syntax but the functions would be the same. And if you know OOP then you would immediately recognize the various classes, methods, etc. and how everything is put together.In terms of learning more than one language, I think there's two schools of thought out there...First school of thought says to learn a bit of one language and get exposed to many other languages that will in turn help you develop a greater understanding of what you already know. This can be quite time consuming but the idea is that the sum is greater than the parts. You may not know everything but you've mastered the basics.Second school of thought says to focus on one language only. Pick a horse and stick with it. The benefit of focus is that you'll be able to move beyond the basics and get into higher-level concepts that you would not normally have time for if you had tried to learn other languages as well. Knowing quite a lot and being fairly proficient is a plus. But the downside would be the lack of a greater understanding that comes from those other languages.I know for me personally, I still haven't figured it out.

Not sure if we're going to learn that technique later on but a function calling itself is known as 'recursion'. So you could have something like this:  def get_hours(seconds): # body of code here return get_hours(seconds)  The real problem is as the error message states. There's two types and the existing code is trying to divide one type by another type. In this case we're trying to divide the function itself 'get_hours' by the integer 2. Point to note is that there's no parentheses after 'get_hours' so it's not a call to the function but really the function itself.So, logically, dividing a function by 2 just doesn't make sense, hence the TypeError.",leader
"Just like to mention that Whitman's error message is really great in terms of learning how to read errors..  TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for //: 'function' and 'int'  First, it's a TypeError which means there's some sort of conflict between one or more types, i.e. a string, an integer, etc. In this case the conflict is between a 'function' and an 'int', the two so-called operands.Second, we have operands but what's the operator, you know, the symbol that separates the two? In this case the error message says the operator is '//', which is the integer division symbol.So, when we think about it, we don't even really need to look at the code to figure out what's wrong. This is a case of trying to divide a 'function' by an 'integer. Not the results of a function divided by an integer. But trying to divide the actual function itself. Now, obviously that doesn't make any sense, hence the error message.All very interesting. :-)",leader

User-defined objects can customize their truth value by providing a __bool__() method.The operator not yields True if its argument is false, False otherwise.The expression x and y first evaluates x; if x is false, its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.The expression x or y first evaluates x; if x is true, its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.",leader

Or it may be continue to the end.Second, all values that are non-zero, etc. are interpreted as True, i.e. both cents and dollars are considered as True since they're not zero, etc.So, if you use the AND operator it will keep evaluating all the values until the end and only return the last one. If you were to use the OR operator, for example, then Python would stop at cents, since it's True, and would not need to check anything else.Some code in action...  >>> dollars = 18 >>> cents = 53 >>> pesos = 0 >>> cents and dollars 18 >>> cents or dollars 53 >>> cents and pesos and dollars 0 >>> cents or pesos or dollars 53 >>> pesos or cents or dollars 53",leader
"Seems to me that the extra lines of code you added are the problem:  for line in a1_file: print(line)  Reading lines in a file is like a one-shot deal. If you read and print the lines in the console then you can't read them again later on in the program. This has the effect of trying to read an empty file and consequently writing to an empty file. Which looks like Tk just hangs.So, comment out the above code & run it again. It will at the very least not cause the reading of an empty file.  ",leader
"Exactly.Here's a post by Jen from a few weeks ago:https://class.coursera.org/programming1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=1028#post-9592  Here is the timeline that we have planned:- Monday Sept 30: release the final exam- Monday Oct 7: soft deadline- Monday Oct 14: hard deadlineWith that schedule, there will be a 2 week period during which you can complete the final exam. As Etienne mentioned, once the exam has been opened you have 3 hours to complete it. You can only attempt the exam once.  ",leader
"For those interested, here's an example:  >>> import gc >>> gc.get_threshold() (700, 10, 10)  You can see the threshold for the three generations, i.e. it's 700 for new objects. So what we can do is create a list object that references itself. This will mess up its reference counting since it can never become zero. Which will then cause it to be a prime candidate for the garbage collector.  >>> def make_reference_cycle(): lst = [ ] lst.append(lst) >>> gc.get_count() (137, 10, 2)Notice the function above creates a list which references itself. The get_count() method shows us the three generations. So, all we have to do is call that function, over and over, to push the new objects above 700...  >>> for x in range(600):	make_reference_cycle() >>> gc.get_count() (0, 11, 2)  Notice how the garbage collector kicked in. No more 1st generation objects to clean up. One object actually survived and was moved to the 2nd generation. Let's keep going...  >>> for x in range(600):	make_reference_cycle() >>> gc.get_count() (550, 11, 2) >>> for x in range(600):	make_reference_cycle() >>> gc.get_count() (369, 0, 3)  Notice the 3rd generation? Interesting how there always seems to be at least one object that survives.Garbage collection in action. :)  ",leader
"What happens to those old memory locations depends on a number of things. Usually it has to do with the type of object that's in the memory location. And how a particular program is written as well.Python uses a two-step process to handle memory allocation. It uses what is known as 'reference counting' and 'garbage collection'.Reference counting is easy enough to understand. Take a list for example. The list object itself will count the number of references that are pointing to it. If the count is zero then it'll be freed. The problem with reference counting is that sometimes it gets messed up. For example, think of a list that references itself where the count can never be zero. This problem is known as 'reference cycles'.So, this is where the garbage collector makes its appearance. It's purpose is really to deal with reference cycles. And it does this on a scheduled basis, every now and then, where it looks to get rid of various objects and to free up memory.Garbage collection itself is handled by the gc module, i.e. you can import gc and call help. Objects are considered as 1st, 2nd, or 3rd generation. More specifically 0, 1, and 2. New objects are 1st generation and if they survive the first sweep of a garbage collection then they're moved to the 2nd generation and so on.Garbage collection, though, has a certain threshold before it's run. If you type the following code you'll see it:  >>> import gc >>> gc.get_threshold() (700, 10, 10)  The way the threshold works is based on object allocations and deallocations. So, if there's 700 more allocations than deallocations then the garbage collector will run.Garbage collection, as a subject, can be quite complicated but here's a few links with much more info:  http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/gc.htmlhttp://www.digi.com/wiki/developer/index.php/Python_Garbage_Collectionhttp://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Modules/gcmodule.c?revision=81029&view=markupEdit: For those interested, here's a more updated version of the C module (26 Sep 2013):  http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Modules/gcmodule.c   ",leader

So, there's an 'Open"" dialog box which is then immediately followed by a 'Save As'. You could run this code yourself, if you want. Just create a blank .txt file so that you have something to open and you'll get a good idea of how everything works.",leader

"Ashwini, what you've stumbled across is a slightly more advanced way in terms of indexing and slicing. In this course we've learned that the index position is the character itself, in order to try and keep things as simple as possible, since we have a lot of things to learn. But here's the slightly more advanced way... The indexing is actually both negative and positive. So it would look like this: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | L e a r n t o P r o g r a m | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | -16 -15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0  Personally I like this method quite a lot since you can do some pretty deep thinking. It works as you described above. But, before you even think about how it works, it's important to understand the fundamentals. First, indexing is not some sort of technical term that we use in programming or just in Python. Think about how indexing works in real life. Take a book for example. We go to the index at the back of the book, look up a word and it gives us a page number. That page number is the index number so that we can actually find the word itself. Let's say it's page[9]. What then? Well, what we actually do is go to page 9 and start reading from the left edge of the page, from left to right. Exactly as you described above. So, in my example, it's not a book but a string instead. No matter, it still works in the same way. 'Learn to Program'[9] returns P. We go to 9 and start reading from the edge, again from left to right. Notice that we Could have done 'Learn to Program'[-7] as well. Same thing since we go to the edge located at -7 and start reading from left to right, again returning P. Second, slicing is not some technical term either. Think about how slicing works in real life. Take a pizza, a birthday cake, or whatever. We first need a knife or some sort of cutting device. What next? Well, we usually need two cuts in order to extract a slice. Unless we're starting from the edge of the cake that's already been cut. But no matter, we still need two cuts. So, in my example, it's not a birthday cake but a string instead. If I want to extract a slice from the string then what do I need? No, I don't need a knife but I still need two cuts. If I want to slice out the word earn then where are the cuts going to take place? That's right, one cut will be at 1 and the other at 5. Which will look like [1:5] or 'Learn to Program'[1:5] which returns earn. Now, what's the exact same slice using negative numbers? Work through it the same way. We need two cuts, with the first cut taking place at -15 and the second cut at -11. Which will look like [-15:-11] or 'Learn to Program'[-15:-11] which returns earn. Pretty cool eh? I'll make another post with some other cool ways to think about slicing.  ",leader
"Seyed-Mahdy, that's correct. It's because one is indexing and the other is slicing.",leader
"I agree with Nick. There's leeway within the Honor Code that is really at the discretion of the staff.Obviously posting stuff before a deadline is against the Honor Code but after a deadline it really is up to the instructors of a course. And having taking the Interactive Python myself, it's also true what Nick mentioned. In fact, there was so much code being posted that at some point it became totally irrelevant. Threads with like 500 posts, LOL.Another thing that I've seen from a previous course, Mathematical Thinking, which was really great. Is that the professor would create weekly videos after an assignment had been completed. For example, if the deadline is Sunday at midnight then he would create a video which would come out on the following Wednesday. And in that video he would not only give the correct answers but work through the problems themselves. There was usually 2-3 of those videos per week, covering assignments that were both graded and not graded.There's an infamous video of ""Alice is a rock star and works in a bank"" where the professor created a 10-minute video of how to think about that particular question. And in that video he focused on just two questions from the assignment. Why create a video that focuses on just two questions? Well, he had been monitoring the forums, looking at test scores, and had determined that these two particular questions were the ones that students were having the most problems with. Great way of teaching.And just a note, all those videos and answers to various assignments are still available. I just checked and actually re-watched the 'Alice' video, LOL. And this course was back in September 2012 with its third iteration currently taking place, if you can believe it.",leader
"Chrissie, that's a great explanation.I particularly liked how you explained the concepts of 'push' and 'pop'. Very simple ideas, if you ask me. And very relevant since next week we get into lists. And guess what? That's right, lists actually have a pop method, LOL. For example: >>> my_list = [1, 2, 3] >>> my_list.pop(0) 1 >>> my_list [2, 3]  I liked how you touched on the concepts of 'underflow' and 'overflow' as well. We hear about those terms all the time, like a 'buffer overflow', but most people don't really know what that means.",leader
"Adina, let me see if I can make some distinctions or try to clarify the situation since you're talking about a lot of different things.Hard drives and memory are both hardware. A hard drive is the spinning disk in your computer. Memory is made up of computer chips that are on your motherboard. The only difference between the two is that things stored on a hard drive are permanent. While things stored in a memory chip will disappear when you turn the power off.Now, in terms of software. Software doesn't have memory. Software is just lines of code that are stored on your hard drive. And if you run a piece of software then some of the code will also be loaded into the memory chips since it's much easier and faster to process bits of information in a memory chip than it is on a hard drive. Hard drives are very slow compared to memory chips.Now, in terms of what we're talking about, i.e. stacks and frames. Those are just programming terms. If you create a function then a frame gets created and that frame is stored somewhere in memory, i.e. it has a memory address. If you call a function then another frame gets created which also gets stored in memory. And frames get stacked on top of one another.Eventually as your program does its thing, well, frames will disappear, one by one, since each frame does its thing and returns a value to the previous frame that called it. Think of it as an un-stacking of frames.Hope that's a little more clear in terms of what you mentioned.",leader
"Adina, defragmenting and stacks have nothing to do with each other.Defragmenting has to do with your hard drive, also known as your hard disk, and not with any sort of memory either. As stuff gets saved onto your hard drive it may not necessarily get saved in the same area. Think of a video that you just downloaded. There may be 'fragments' all over your hard drive. And when the time comes to play it, well, your hard drive is looking all over the place for the various 'fragments'.So, what defragmentation does is try to put all the various pieces of a video, or whatever sort of file, into one area of the hard drive. This way it'll speed up your system and the hard drive itself won't have to keep looking for stuff.You're right about the automatic defragmenting that goes on nowadays. Before, you had to 'defrag' every so often, just to keep your hard drive up to speed. Now most of that is done automatically.",leader
"I wouldn't get too hung up on the jargon. It's very much common sense.Think of a stack of books. That's all it is. One book on top of another. Or as Professor Gries mentioned in one of his videos, it's like a stack of plates but upside down. The upside down reference is because a frame gets created and instead of being put on top it's put below.A frame itself isn't too complicated. We all have frames at home, you know, like a picture frame with four sides that looks like a box. That's why they call it a frame. Except in this instance a frame is a so-called global frame with its function definitions and other frames that get stacked as functions get called. No matter, the frames are still four-sided boxes that represent function calls. That's why they call it a call stack. Function calls stacked on top of each other.We could try and make it more complicated but then it would probably be for a cocktail party or something. :)",leader
"If I could offer up a suggestion and I've seen this done in other courses. Create a thread, i.e. for each assignment, where students can post their code and get assessed by their peers. Obviously AFTER the hard deadline but at least they'll get some sort of feedback.",leader

"You are correct that there is a string method to get length. But the so-called special or magic methods are not always equivalent to their function counterparts. Some functions have added functionality compared to their special methods. Functionality such as checking for errors or the ability to handle exceptions. There's also the issue of future changes to the underlying code which may cause a program to break if someone is not using the proper method or function to begin with. For example, s.__next__() is not equivalent to next(s):   >>> s = iter('a') >>> s.__next__() 'a' >>> s.__next__() Traceback (most recent call last): File ""<pyshell#71>"", line 1, in <module> s.__next__() StopIteration >>> s = iter('a') >>> next(s) 'a' >>> next(s) Traceback (most recent call last): File ""<pyshell#74>"", line 1, in <module> next(s) StopIteration  In the above code, both of them broke, as expected. Below it's different in that the function can handle the exception simply because it has added functionality: >>> s = iter('a') >>> s.__next__('') Traceback (most recent call last): File ""<pyshell#76>"", line 1, in <module> s.__next__('') TypeError: expected 0 arguments, got 1 >>> s = iter('a') >>> next(s, '') 'a' >>> next(s, '') ''  ",leader
"Cool, I definitely saw all sorts of ways to generate arrays on that course.I'm just watching the videos for the current edition.

That's right Camoya. But it is really simple arithmetic. Consider a similar example of fractional addition. If you want to add 1/2 + 2/3 + 5/6 you first convert to the lowest common denominator. 3/6 + 4/6 + 5/6 becomes very easy to add together. Think of hours as the lowest common denominator.

"Here's the best explanation I've seen:Objects that have been created (and everything is an object in Python) occupy the memory allocated to the Python interpreter process. When you import a module, its code is executed, resulting in the Creation of many objects (functions, classes, data, etc.), most of which must persist in memory to be useful. By separating functionality into logically distinct modules, we allow programs to devote their memory only to objects providing the functionality they need. If everything were built-in, you would have a huge chunk of memory devoted to all the classes, functions, and other objects of the entire standard library, less than 1% of which would actually be useful to the average program. Furthermore, you would waste time executing all the Code that creates all these objects, every time the interpreter starts.So you can run much faster and use less memory by not wasting your time with a lot of things that you never use but they are available for those who do need them.",leader

You already wrote code to do that so you may as well just call it instead of rewriting it in the body of get_complementary_sequence. Not a big deal here but if get_complement was hundreds of lines of code you would save an enormous amount of time by reusing it.

His question was:""But, I am wondering if we could actually do and practice higher(University) level Math using programming alone?""The answer is no, programming is not mathematics and programming does does substitute for mathematics nor alleviate the need to learn mathematics to do mathematics. It does not replace the need to understand physics either.

"I think that you are doing this poor kid (I assume it's a young person) a horrible disservice by telling him that he can learn mathematics by programming. That was his question. You can no more do that than you can learn to be a carpenter by running a saw mill or learn a foreign language by buying a dictionary.Mathematics is the study of sets of abstract objects and their relationships. Mathematics is set theory, logic, metric spaces, real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, integration theory, topology, linear algebra (not matrix math), abstract algebra, number theory, ODE's, PDE's, etc. Computers have very little application to theory and one certainly can not learn mathematical theory by learning to program. Even the suggestion that he could learn applied mathematics by learning to program in incorrect. Applied mathematics, what I do, is asymptotic analysis, perturbation theory, global analysis, boundary layer theory, integral equations, inverse problems, etc. In fact, applied mathematics depends heavily on all of the above fields of pure mathematics plus knowledge of the field to which it is being applied, whether engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, finance, financial engineering, economics, etc. The average young person has a misconception that mathematics is about solving an equation such as they've seen most of their lives. It is not. In fact, most mathematicians rarely work with numbers or equations. Is mathematics useful for a programmer? Certainly, but the math depends on what you need to program. A fundamental understanding of discrete math and logic will make you a better programmer. Beyond that, the math you need to know depends on what you need to do. If you need to model complex non-linear dynamical systems or do Monte Carlo simulations of gases or quantum systems then you better understand the physics and mathematics of what you're doing. Otherwise you won't get past the first line of your program. You're not going to learn that material by writing a program if you have no idea what the program is even supposed to do.So what can technology do for a mathematician, physicist, engineer, chemist, or biologist? It can be incredibly useful in solving lengthy numerical problems that we previously had zero hope of solving by hand. It allows us to simulate very complex systems that we otherwise would never have been able to model by hand. We can analyze huge data sets and from them develop theories or test existing theories. While it's a fantastic tool, it does not provide the theory as to why a system behaves the way it does or how we can extrapolate to another system. In fact, without the theory you really have no idea of how to even write a program or whether your program is doing anything realistic. About 15-20 years ago, in the US, there was a massive push to integrate technology into university classrooms. Every kid in algebra or trigonometry had a graphing calculator. Entire books were written on how to do math with your calculator. What we found was that nobody learned math, they learned how to push keys to get a numerical answer. When they got to calculus they didn't have the prerequisite knowledge. So the powers that be decided that we should do calculus with calculators. Then when the students got to the first real math class they all failed because they didn't know calculus. There was spillover to their science and engineering classes because the math department wasn't doing their job. Now we have backed away from that. We allow calculators in the classroom as a learning aid but still require that the students learn math. We teach them math and allow the calculator as a tool for visualizing what they've learned and doing tedious calculations, not as a substitute for learning mathematics. We essentially lost a generation of kids with an experiment gone awry. No Vijay, you can not learn mathematics or physics or chemistry or biology or engineering or economics by learning to program. If you want to study those things you need to study those things and then you might find your programming skills to be a useful tool. However, if you become a pure mathematician or a theoretical physicist you will probably find that the primary use for your computer is sending e-mail or surfing the web because it won't be useful in your work. If you would like a taste of what mathematics is, here is a free download of a very good book:http://www.trillia.com/zakon1.htmlThis is the kind of book that we use in what we call a bridge class. It is generally for students who have finished calculus and need an introduction to real mathematics before taking higher level topic specific courses. They learn fundamental concepts of set theory, logic, relationships, and equivalence as well as getting an introduction to what a proof is. There are a couple of other free books on the site but you should start with this one. Whether your interest is in pure or applied mathematics these concepts and skills are fundamental.",leader

"Hi Keilah - I would do as Rodney suggests and start with two masses to see if you can get that to work. If however, I was interested in modelling the solar system, I would probably start with realistic masses. The sun is essentially stationary because its mass is about 300,000 times the mass of the earth. It would probably be easier to see if it's working. Of course, the dynamics is more interesting if the masses are similar, but it's up to you.The other suggestion is to use realistic units. It's been a very looooong time but I used to do molecular dynamics using FORTRAN and an abacus. Your life will be way easier and your code will be much less susceptible to roundoff error if you choose units on the scale of the problem. You don't measure a foot race in microns and centuries but that's essentially what you're doing. I, personally, would choose the unit of mass to be the earth mass. Then the sun mass is 330,000 earth masses. Choose the natural unit of distance to be the earth-sun distance. Then choose your time unit to be something realistic like one year since that's the period of the orbit. Given those conversions, I find the gravitational constant G to be 0.000118.There are many choices. For example, you could choose the unit of time to be a day instead of a year (that changes G), you could choose the sun mass to be your unit of mass, or you could choose G=1. That determines your time scale for a given mass and length scale. The whole point is to try to make the problem as close as possible to order 1 to eliminate all of that unnecessary code and all of those unnecessary floating operations. It will run much faster with much greater accuracy. With respect to my comment about your time increment, I think you chose a month, 1/12 of an orbit, as your increment. Imagine that, to a very crude first approximation, you are trying to approximate a circle by a series of line segments. You won't get anything resembling a circle with 12 line segments. You would have to play with it to find out where your model goes bad but I would run it with a time increment of maybe 1/100 of an orbit and then 1/1000 of an orbit, etc, tracking the difference as you go. When finer time increments don't improve accuracy you've likely found a reasonable increment. It's as much art as science because the machine is rather dumb.",leader

I decided to teach myself Python to do those assignments and had fairly good luck. With work, I was able to write most of the programs and they worked when I passed small data sets for test cases. My issue was that the data sets for the assignments came in the form of huge sets of data (100,000 or more) in text files using notepad or some such thing. The data had to be read from the text file into arrays to be used by the program. I never did figure out a way to read the data for my programs to use and everyone on the discussion boards used different languages and had different methods for reading data. So I ended up with working code but I couldn't complete the assignments because I couldn't read the given data.So is there some standard method or best method for reading a generic file from within a Python program?

"Be careful, mystery('abc1') should return 'abc'. You add all non digit characters until you hit a digit and then return the string generated.This is my understanding of a while loop. The while line contains a conditional. Python first evaluates the conditional. If it is True then python continues and executes the body of the loop. It then returns to the first line and re-evaluates the conditional. As long as that conditional is true it will continue to execute the body of the loop repetitively. The very first time that the conditional is False python skips the loop, never to return to the loop, and executes the next line in the code following the body of the loop. In this case the while statement contains the conditional while not s[i].isdigit():If the current character is a letter then is.digit is False, not is.digit is true and the body is executed. As soon as you encounter a digit then is.digit is True, not is.digit is False and you exit the loop and return result.",leader
Try mystery('abc1') and you'll see what's happening.,leader
'abc' returns the out of range because on the third iteration of the loop (i=2) you increment i by 1 and try to iterate on the 4th element but there isn't one. With '123abc' you exit the loop when you hit a digit. That makes isdigit true and not isdigit false so you don't continue.,leader

In code 2: It will return 1 because when num = 1, the if block is executed. But if num = 2, the else block is executed and therefore found_even = true.

"Question 1:So far in lectures we have run programs from IDLE.  How do you run a file directly from the command line? if you import a program, the main part of the program will only run once and you can't run it again unless you restart the command line interpreter. Also, If you import a file, the functions in the file are called as functions in a module <filename> and you have to call them as filename.function(arguments) rather than function(arguments). Therefore, importing a file seems to be different from running it. Is there a way to run a file directly from the command line and is there a way to run it more than once without restarting the command line interpreter? Question 2:If a function defined in a .py file calls other functions defined in same file, must the functions it calls be defined before the calling function is defined? If I understood the lectures on visualizing program execution correctly, variables for all of the functions defined at the ""main"" level of the file (i.e. are not defined only as local variables in other functions) are created when the file is imported. If that is true then the order of defining functions in the file should not matter as long as they are defined ""at the top level"" so the function names are global variables. I just have to be sure that anything called is defined before it is called. Do I understand that correctly?Brad Walter",non-leader

"Thanks, Vadim but in the example with \n, I don't want to print the long text string on two lines, which is what this will do.

However the statement itself is too long. I need to wrap it to the next line in the middle of the long string without affecting the format of the output of the print statement. I could break the string into two with plus sign between them and simply continue on the next line something like the followingprint(hour + ':' + min + ':' + sec, '\nField 57 is the UT equivalent of HJD' +     'in sexagesimal format hh:mm:ss.ssssss.')I was trying to find out if there is a better way to do this.the %s!' % seems to be some kind of appending operator but I can't find a reference to % used this way, only as modulo.

"Simon,I didn't intend to start the final exam. i just opened it. since I didn't enter through the website through announcements page I incorrectly assumed that the final followed the same pattern as other exercises. Do it in your own time and submit before the deadline. The countdown timer gave indicated that was a big mistake. Anonymous,That is a good suggestion. I will have to look around in Coursera to see how I do that. Brad Walter",non-leader
"Thanks for your reply, but actually, it is very easy if you have created links directly to other pages within the website such as video lectures. You can enter the course through any number of pages without going through the main page and once inside the course website you can navigate from page to page without opening the main page. Internet at my home is quite slow so I download all the new course material I see at my office without looking at it and work on it at home. Unfortunately, I checked the final exam page half expecting it would still be blank and I would not have noticed that I might have made a bad blunder, except for the timer. At that point I knew I was ""cooked"" because the timer would expire before returning home from work, so the final exam score will be 0.If there is a procedural detail as important as this, the instruction and warning should not reside only on a separate location from the material. That is why, for example, safety warnings are required on access points to hazardous areas of equipment as well as in the manuals and instructions. A product would never meet the criteria for UL listing and labeling or CE mark without satisfying this requirement. A better way to control access to the exam is is to have the final exam tab open a cover page with a click-through requiring a response to the instruction and warning before permitting access to the exam. You know, the kind of procedure you have to follow any time you buy something on-line or when you install software and have to agree to the license conditions before you can proceed with the installation . You can't get to the next page until you have filled in the responses, and your responses satisfy the validation criteria. It's my mistake, but with all of the technology that has been built into Coursera, there is a much better method of controlling access that should not be difficult to implement. it seems silly, and in my case infuriating, that the website would permit such a mistake, particularly since the technology is already implemented on the website on every quiz and exercise that requires you to respond to the honor code statement before allowing submission. In my case the only reason this matters is self-satisfaction and a sense of frustration and disappointment after several weeks of effort. The grade isn't important except to my competitive ego, but seeing how I stack up against expectations for proficiency at the end of the course is an independent evaluation as to how well I understood and can work with the material. That aspect of the course is no longer possible and I doubt I will devote the time to taking the same course again for that reason alone. I hope the above explanation provides a sufficient answer as to how someone can fail to see the announcement. Further, I hope that Coursera web managers and the instructors for this course note the suggestion for improvement and implement it on future course offerings. It is only because I think Coursera is such a wonderful Idea, that I devote the time to respond to such a thoughtless anonymous comment and offer a suggestion for improvement. Brad Walter",non-leader
"Tom, your analogy breaks down in several places1. entering the course website via a link to a page other than the home page is not ""jumping the fence."" ist is a perfiectly legitimate action. 2. Forums are not analogous to warning signs they are discussion groups and are completely optional. doubt many follow all threads 3. Posting a warning on the home page is like posting a warning on one entrance of a building that has many, rather than posting it on the entrance to the dangerous area.4. Just because the final exam comes at the end of the course is not an indication of danger. It is simply a fact of chronology5.The small warning sign you reference does not say you can only enter once it says ""Your effective score will be the score of your first attempt made before the hard deadline"" That means you can only submit your answers once not that you can only enter once on all previous assignments you could enter and save as many times as you desire but there was a limit on the number of submissions, usually 3.6. Also posting a sign on a danger area is not sufficient by itself. Access must be controlled. Otherwise, if someone is injured, you will pay a large liability claim. I could go on but it is pointless.

It would be a lot better if I had all of the tools on my computer rather than needing the internet to use them. Second question: in the foggy past I knew the purpose of a path statement associated with an executable. Can someone remind me? is it just the directory where the program defaults to save and load files or is there more to it? If not more to it could I set the path to a directory in my user account area instead? When loading Python in windows there is an option to load a path statement to the registry. The default is not to load it, and I didn't. Subsequently, when I tried to load saved . py files Python didn't know where to look, which isn't surprising. I subsequently loaded the top level python directory (which was the default) using the command window. However. I like to keep stuff I create in my user account area. rather than mixed in with program files. Even though stuff I create may be programs it is in essence executable data to the Python environment and keeping it in my user area is better from the standpoint of intermediate backups.

"But those commands in the Python shell only work for the current instance of python. Also it doesn't place you in the directory you want in working path.

I saved this as a text file in the Python 33 program directory so I had it for easy reference. Also I created a file path_working.py and saved it in the same directory. This doesn't seem to work from the shell but it does work in IDLE if you open it and then run the module. def set_working_path():   import os   import sys   working_path = 'C:\\Users\\Brad Walter\\Documents\\Python'   sys.path.append(working_path)   os.chdir(working_path)   return os.path.abspath('.')the return statement confirms that it worked and you are now in your working directory. setting the path to your working directory one time in the ""start in"" parameter box of the desktop icon for IDLE is the easiest way of setting up your working directory, but if you use the shell or don't start IDLE from the desk top icon, the other methods work. Interestingly, or perhaps oddly, you execute the dir() function lists the contents of the current scope as>>> dir()['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', 'set_working_path']I have no idea where this is pulled from. It doesn't agree with the contents of any directory I could find, and set working path is the function name in my path_working.py file. However, if you use dir('.') which you would think would correspond to the contents of the current directory and perhaps subdirectories, You get another much longer list which also doesn't seem to correspond to a particular directory.

In other cases such as omitting one of the parentheses, it will indent too far. If you are composing in a plain text editor, do not use the tab key or any other kind of automatic indenting feature.

That implies, for example that I would not want to call the math module from within the triangle module since they are stored in different directories. Instead, I must call the math module in the main program because python has the path information to locate modules distributed with it when called from the main program. could I call a module from a different directory from within a module by first executing some sort of change directory statement and then, after calling the module change back to the directory where the calling module is, or is there a way to include path statements in a module so that you can call modules in other directories.?Brad Walter",non-leader

"Well I searched everywhere under Python33 in Windows for math and __math__ . in The closest thing I can find is Python33\Lib\test\test_math.py. However this file appears to be some sort of test utility and one of the first statements is import math. See below.# Python test set -- math module# XXXX Should not do tests around zero onlyfrom test.support import run_unittest, verbose, requires_IEEE_754from test import supportimport unittestimport mathimport osimport platformimport sysimport structimport sysconfigIf you go to http://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html?highlight=module%20locations and scroll down to section 3.3.3 Finding Modules, it directs you to the Lib subdirectory. I can't find it in that directory or any subdirectory of Lib. As Geoffrey Rush's character frequently exclaimed in Shakespeare in Love, ""It's a Mystery!""After writing my initial e-mail I realized that you can use a module in any other module you import without importing it into the main program first, but you would have to include import statement in the calling module before trying to call anything in the referenced module AND the referenced module would only be available in the module that contained the import statement. It appears that third party modules - this could include the ones the user creates - are intended to be in a subdirectory of Lib called site-packages. This is covered in the above section in the doc on using python with windows and a README.txt file in that directory states: ""This directory exists so that 3rd party packages can be installedhere. Read the source for site.py for more details.""However, for backup reasons. I think it would be better to include an add additional path in the registry to a folder in the users My Documents directory. Now If I only knew how to do that.

"I know the wording seems odd at first but it is definitely not ambiguous and it is precisely correct even though I had to read it three times to jog my memory. in Boolean algebra A OR B -> True is exactly equivalent to NOT(A) AND NOT(B) -> FalseA -> True if and only if NOT(A) -> False. B -> True if and only if NOT(B) -> False.  Something can't be true and false at the same time.

"Thank you Tolunay for your reply. But the fact that I spent so much time and would probably have to spend as much time if I had to redo the exercise or the assignment one week later shows that I don't ""build"" my knowledge.At this stage I am unable to create examples of applications on my own beyond what is offered. For instance question 5 in the exercise this week is very complicated for me because I simply did not digest the concepts ""while"" ""for"" ""range"" well enough. I know I will get there at some stage but I also know that at the end of the many hours I will spend finding a solution I won't have that feeling that I am understanding things better.I plan to read the full chapter 9 of pragmatic programming and hope it will fall into place in my head.I just think there is something wrong in the rhythm of this class since last week, and I wish we had more opportunities to try exercises specific with each function before we have to combine them all and arbitrate which one we should choose. We all know that in Python the devil is in the details: one indent wrong or a punctuation issue and the code won't work.I am way beyond the work load time so I am wondering if I am the only one feeling that I am struggling for no true result in the end.If I am the only one with that feeling then maybe programming is not for me.",non-leader

I might get away with this week's exercise the same way I finally finished last week's assignment and exercise, but I have a feeling that I will be stuck next week because I don't feel I deeply understand what I am doing.I should add that I don't have two days per week to dedicate to the course either.

"If anyone is interested I just want to tell how I apply Mindmaps (special thanks to Tony Buzan) during classes at Coursera. I hope that this information may be useful for other students. I had attempted the course once in 2012 and failed. Now I am doing much better. Introduction About Mind mapping – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map I am using some of the ideas I have seen in this article (in Russian), slightly modified. http://habrahabr.ru/post/155891/ Mind mapping software I am using great MindMapping software called Xmind (www.xmind.net), it is open-source and its basic version is completely free. More detailed information is provided below. Folders All the information of the course is to be collected and organized – this is how my folders look like: I hope that one day this folder will also contain the certificate of accomplishment. :) All the materials for each week are stored in appropriate folder. For example, this is the contents of Week 4 folder: Quizzes are downloaded in .pdf format and stored in Quizzes folder, the Assignment 2 folder has inside the .py file I submitted for the assignment and the instructions to the Assignment saved (printed in Google Chrome) as a .pdf. Same for each Week exercise - I print as .pdf the results of my best attempt to pass each week's exercise. Xmind All the above was about organizing materials. The most important part is about organizing thoughts and ideas, i.e. about mind mapping. As I have told, I am using Xmind. This is how the fist sheet of my mindmap looks like right now: When letter “c” on any Week branch is clicked, another sheet opens (separate linked sheets are added by Ctrl + Alt + T). It is useful also to rename the default sheet name (Sheet 1) into something like ‘01’ to save space. Here’s a part of the Week 4 sheet: You can see a VLC Player icon at the right side of the “str indexing and slicing” branch – it is a relative link that leads to a video file with the appropriate lecture. Links to Assignment file and Quizzes folder are also added (not visible in the picture). It is also useful to include in mindmaps screenshots taken from videos and IDLE, insert pictures, attach files and make comments. Mindmaps are really pretty useful during exercises and assignments. The mindmap for the course (current version of 4 weeks) is here. Feel free to download it and view it in Xmind. Of course, links to videos and my local folders will not work. If this information is helpful to anyone, I’ll be happy. If you have your own techniques that help in learning – I’ll be very pleased if you tell about them. Thank you for your attention.",non-leader
